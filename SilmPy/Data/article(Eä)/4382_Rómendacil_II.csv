'''Rómendacil II''' ({{TA| 1126}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1366|n}}<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>, aged 240 years), born '''Minalcar''', was the nineteenth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
[[Minalcar]] was a vigourous man, as his uncle King [[Narmacil I]] recognized.  In order to unburden himself from the cares of government, Narmacil appointed Minalcar as Regent of the realm in {{TA|1240}}.  From then until his father's death in {{TA|1304|n}}, Minalcar ruled in the name of the kings before becoming King in his own right.

As Regent, Minalcar's main concern was the state of the North.  In the wide lands beyond the [[Anduin]] the [[Northmen]] had multiplied.  These people had been shown favour by the Kings in the past but when, in the days of Narmacil I, the [[Easterlings]] resumed their attacks it was discovered that not all of the Northmen adhered to [[Gondor]].  To secure the region, in {{TA|1248}} Minalcar led a great force that defeated a large Easterling army between [[Rhovanion]] and the [[Sea of Rhûn]], and even destroyed their encampments east of the Sea.  Minalcar then took the name Rómendacil or "East-victor".

After his victory Rómendacil fortified the western shore of the Anduin up to the River [[Limlight]], and had the [[Argonath|Pillars of the Argonath]] built above [[Nen Hithoel]].  Seeking to increase Gondor's manpower, Rómendacil brought many Northmen into his service.  To one leader, [[Vidugavia]], who called himself the [[King of Rhovanion]], Rómendacil showed special favour.  He sent his son [[Valacar]] in {{TA|1250}} to live with Vidugavia as Gondor's ambassador.

When Narmacil died with no child, Rómendacil's father Calmacil succeeded to the throne.  Calmacil, coming to the Kingship in his old age, kept Rómendacil in his position as Regent.  When Calmacil died in {{TA|1304|n}} his son finally became the King, and became Rómendacil II.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> After a glorious Regency, he enjoyed a peaceful and uneventful Kingship.
