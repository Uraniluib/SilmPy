}}'''Maedhros''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈmaɛðrɔs]}}) was one of the princes of the [[Noldor]] and was eldest of the [[Sons of Fëanor]].

==History==
Maedhros was born in [[Valinor]] during the Time of the [[Two Trees]]. After the banishment of [[Fëanor]] from [[Tirion]] in Valinor he went with his father to [[Formenos]] in exile. When [[Morgoth]] killed Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved [[Silmarils]], Maedhros was the first son to take the terrible [[Oath of Fëanor]] to recover the jewels.

Maedhros went with his father to [[Alqualondë]], where the [[First Kinslaying]] broke out, in which he took part. When Fëanor sailed off without the host of [[Fingolfin]], Maedhros thought that he was planning to return and carry across the others. He expected that the first ship would carry [[Fingon]], his best friend. When he learned that in fact, Fëanor planned to abandon them, he was angry and, alone of his brothers, refused to help burn the ships, to prevent Fingolfin from following.

When Fëanor was killed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], Maedhros became the [[High King of the Noldor]]. However, this position was held briefly, as [[Morgoth]] sent an embassy, feigning the surrender of a Silmaril. The Oath driving him, Maedhros also feigned to treat with Morgoth, but instead he was captured by Morgoth's embassy and hung by the wrist of his right hand upon the face of a precipice of [[Thangorodrim]], for about thirty years. In a daring rescue, his cousin [[Fingon]], helped by [[Thorondor]] the King of Eagles, saved him from torment, but he had to cut off Maedhros's hand to release him from the shackle. In gratitude for this, and in atonement for Fëanor's desertion of Fingon's house, Maedhros relinquished all claim as the heir of Finwë and made his uncle [[Fingolfin]], Fingon's father, High King of the Noldor, something his brothers did not like.

Seeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved them out of [[Hithlum]], and later ruled the lands around the [[Hill of Himring]], which became known as the [[March of Maedhros]]. Allied with Fingolfin, he won the battle of [[Dagor Aglareb]], and, thanks to his daring deeds during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Himring]] stood while many other elven realms fell. 

Hearing word of the deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the [[Union of Maedhros]], an alliance to lay siege to Morgoth's fortress of [[Angband]]. However, no support came from [[Thingol]] or [[Nargothrond]], due to the deeds of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], Maedhros' brothers. The Union and the siege was utterly broken after the defeat in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Himring was garrisoned by [[Orcs]]. Maedhros and his brothers lived in [[Ossiriand]], consorting with the [[Laiquendi]].

Maedhros learned that [[Dior]], son of Beren and Lúthien, had inherited the Silmaril that they had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, he allowed his brother [[Celegorm]] to convince him to attack Doriath. Celegorm, [[Caranthir]], and [[Curufin]] were slain by [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]], the King of Doriath, who was in turn slain by them. Dior's sons, [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's servants in the forest, leading Maedhros to search for the innocent youths, but to no avail. After learning that [[Elwing]], Dior's daughter, had survived, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the [[Havens of Sirion]]. The Noldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]] in the sack, but Elwing escaped with the Silmaril, jumping off a cliff.

After the [[War of Wrath]], he and his last surviving brother, [[Maglor]] stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the [[Valar]] from Morgoth. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor's and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. He is the only known [[Elf]] to have committed suicide. It is uncertain whether he was eventually released from [[Mandos]], or whether he still remains there with his father.

== Etymology ==
Maedhros' [[father-name]] was '''[[Nelyafinwë]]''', meaning "Finwë the Third",  shorter form '''Nelyo''', as his grandfather and father both shared the name ''Finwë''. ''[[Nelya]]'' is a [[Quenya]] adjective that means "third". His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''[[Maitimo]]''', "Well-shaped One", for he was noted for his comeliness. His [[epessë]] was '''[[Russandol]]''', "Copper-top", referring to the dark red hair he inherited from his grandfather [[Mahtan]]. It is derived from ''[[russa]]'', a Quenya adjective meaning "red-haired". 

In ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', note# 65, it is said that the names Maitimo and Russandol are the base for the [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] name Maedhros (derived from a contraction of ''Mait-'' + ''Rus-''). 

In the earlier work ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the name Maedhros is original [[Noldorin]], and is said to mean "Pale-glitter". It is formed by the adding up ''[[maidh]]'' ("pale", "fallow" or "fawn") and "archaic" ''[[rhoss]]'' ("flash", "glitter of metal").
