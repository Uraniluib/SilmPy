'''Winterfilth''' was the tenth month of the [[Shire Calendar]], approximately corresponding to modern [[22 September]] through [[21 October]]. 

This month was called [[Wintring]] in [[Bree]]. It was a jest in Bree to speak of "Winterfilth in the (muddy) Shire"<ref name=cal>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name referred to the completion of the year ("filling") before Winter in their old calendar (before they adopted the [[King's Reckoning]]) when their new year began after harvest.<ref name=cal/>

The name actually represents a [[Hobbitish|modernization]] of the [[Old English]] name for October, ''[[wiktionary:winterfylleþ|Winterfylleþ]]'', meaning "Winter-filling" or "Winter-full moon".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_smn.html|articlename=The Shire month-names|author=[[Arden R.
