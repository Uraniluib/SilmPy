}}'''Beren the Renowned''' ({{FA|432}} – {{FA|503|n}}), aged approx. 71 years at the time of his final death) was a [[Men|Man]] of [[Middle-earth]], a hero whose romance with the [[Elves|Elf]] [[Lúthien]] was one of the great stories of the [[Elder Days]].

== History ==
== Life in Dorthonion ==
[[Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - Beren Heraldic Device.png|thumb|left|70px|Beren's heraldic device]]
Beren was the son of [[Barahir]] and [[Emeldir]] and was named after [[Beren (son of Belemir)|Beren, his maternal grandfather]]. He was a Man of the royal [[House of Bëor]] of [[Dorthonion]] for his father was most likely the last Chieftain of the House of Bëor. The [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame") befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his land. The young Beren lived with his father and ten loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the twelve of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of [[Morgoth]], the Dark Lord of [[Angband]]. After the betrayal and death of the Outlaws of Dorthonion due to the treachery of [[Gorlim the Unhappy]], Beren swore an oath to avenge his father, "but wept not, for his heart was ice". He recovered the [[Ring of Barahir]] from the [[Orcs]], and lived on as an outlaw, whose feats of daring were renown throughout the free world. Eventually he was forced to abandon the land of his birth and the grave of his father. He crossed into [[Doriath]], where he saw and fell in love with [[Lúthien]], princess of the [[Sindar]] and daughter of [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]] when he saw her dancing.

===[[Quest for the Silmaril]]===
[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Beren at Thingol's Court.jpg|thumb|left|Felix Sotomayor - ''Beren at Thingol's Court'']]
Thingol refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage, as Beren was a mortal. He charged Beren that he would allow the marriage to take place only if he brought back a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren was determined. He set out on this impossible quest with the aid of [[Finrod]] of [[Nargothrond]], but was soon captured by [[Sauron]] and imprisoned in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Lúthien, along with [[Huan]] the great hound, eventually came to their rescue. 
[[Image:Ted_Nasmith_-_Transformed.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Transformed'']]
Using Lúthien's powers to place Morgoth's court into a deep sleep, they were able to enter Angband where Beren was able to cut a Silmaril from Morgoth's iron crown. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf [[Carcharoth]], whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken.  Carcharoth bit off his hand, swallowing it along with the Silmaril, and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Thus Beren was called '''''Erchamion''''', "One-handed". Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of [[Manwë]]. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.

Unable to deal with the death of her beloved, Lúthien, overcome with grief, laid down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of [[Mandos]], where she managed to move Mandos so that he granted her a wish. Both she and Beren were restored to life, but both of them would die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of [[Arda]] to a place unknown.

===Later History===
{{Quote|(...) and whether the second span of his life was brief or long is not known to Elves or Men|Draft to ''Quenta Silmarillion''}}
Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on [[Tol Galen]] in the middle of the [[Adurant|River Adurant]] in [[Ossiriand]]. There they stayed apart from other mortals. Lúthien bore Beren a son, named [[Dior]], Thingol's heir. He was considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, the blood of Elves, and the blood of the [[Ainur]]. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]].

Beren was involved with the events of the [[First Age]] only one further time. After the murder of Thingol, [[Mablung]] was sent by Melian to warn Beren. He gathered the [[Green-elves]] and with the aid of some [[Ents]]<ref>{{L|248}}</ref> they waylaid a group of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] who had [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|destroyed]] Doriath and stolen its treasures. They ambushed the Dwarves and vanquished them in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]]; because the Lord of Nogrod cursed the treasure, Beren threw it in the river [[Ascar]], but salvaged the [[Nauglamir]] which he brought to his wife. Their son Dior left to restore and rule [[Menegroth]].<ref name=doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> 

Beren and Lúthien died together on Tol Galen. Among the Children of [[Ilúvatar]] the final death of Beren and Lúthien is accounted in {{FA|503}} for in the Autumn of that year Dior received the Silmaril in Doriath, and it was taken as a sign of his parents' death. In truth the date of their death is unknown.<ref name=doriath/><ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 306</ref>
==Physical description==
Beren had golden-brown hair and  grey eyes. He was taller than most of his kinsmen, but (according to the trait of his House) he was broad-shouldered, and his limbs were very strong.<ref name=n46/>
==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Beren Erchamion.mp3|Ardamir}}
Beren is glossed as "bold" in [[Noldorin]] of the ''[[Etymologies]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root [[BER]] p.352</ref>

His epithet ''Erchamion'' means "one-handed"<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp.51, 231</ref>. It has been suggested that ''Camlost'' means "empty-handed". Both epithets contain [[Sindarin]] ''cam'' "hand".<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>

== Inspiration==
The story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was a central part of the [[legendarium]]. Tolkien once referred to it as "the kernel of the mythology".<ref>{{L|165}}</ref> He went on to say that it "arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks'", which he visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during [[World War I]]). 

In the earliest versions of the legendarium (see: ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''), Beren was a ''[[Gnome]]'' (a [[Noldo]]), son of [[Egnor (disambiguation)|Egnor]] (which might have been an early name for [[Aegnor]]).

Tolkien seemed to be somehow connected to this character, and parallels can be drawn with his relationship with [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]]. Furthermore it is possible that ''Beren'' (meaning 'brave') is a reference to the original meaning of his Germanic surname (Toll kühn) of similar meaning. It is said that, like the story of Lúthien dancing in the woods before Beren, that one day while Tolkien and his wife were on a picnic in the woods she danced for him, thus creating another parallel to Beren and Luthien. 

Tolkien was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford) and this name appears on the stone:

:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 – 1973

The name of Lúthien also appears on the stone:

:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971
