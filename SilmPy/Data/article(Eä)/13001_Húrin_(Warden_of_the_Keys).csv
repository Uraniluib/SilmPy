}}'''Húrin the Tall''', also referred to as "Lord Húrin" or '''Húrin of the Keys''', was the [[Warden of the Keys]] of [[Minas Tirith]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
Húrin fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], and along with [[Forlong]], [[Hirluin]], and [[Imrahil]] came to the aid of the [[Rohirrim]] when they were outnumbered and hard-pressed.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

He was left in command of the small garrison that stayed behind while the armies of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]] marched to the [[Black Gate]].  At the coronation of [[Aragorn]], he opened a barricade (laid in place of the destroyed gate) at the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|gatehouse of of Minas Tirith]] for the new king.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
