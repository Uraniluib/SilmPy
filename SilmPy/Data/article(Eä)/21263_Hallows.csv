The '''Hallows''' or '''the Tombs''' were a place in [[Minas Tirith]] where [[Kings of Gondor]], [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] and other important men of the realm were buried. It was built on the shoulder of the hill, belonged to the fourth level of the city and accessed through the sixth, by passing the [[Fen Hollen]] to [[Rath Dínen]].  The Hallows contained the [[House of the Kings]] and the [[House of the Stewards]].<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>

On [[15 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the Steward [[Denethor|Denethor II]] brought his son [[Faramir]] to the Hallows where he intended to burn both of them alive.  The guard [[Beregond]] tried to save Faramir but was held up by Denethor's servants.  Beregond had killed two of the servants in the Hallows before [[Gandalf]], alerted by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], came and rescued Faramir.  Denethor though succeeded in taking his own life.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

After [[Aragorn]] had become King he passed judgement upon Beregond for the spilled blood in the Hallows.  Aragorn banished Beregond from Minas Tirith but mercifully let him live and honored him by appointing him to the [[White Company]], the Guard of Faramir, newly become the [[Prince of Ithilien]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

[[Borondir]], a soldier of Gondor whose deeds in the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]] earned him great renown, was laid in tomb in the Hallows after his death in that battle.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

King [[Théoden]] was temporarily placed in the Hallows after his death until his body was brought back to [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

The [[Hobbits]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and Peregrin Took, of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]], were also given a place there after their deaths, beside the tomb of King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].<ref>{{App|Later}}, S.R. 1484</ref>
