'''Moths''' were nocturnal insects of a kind closely related to [[Butterflies|butterflies]]. [[Bilbo Baggins]] found them fluttering at nightfall on his first visit to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{H|3}}</ref> Curiously, they are also mentioned as dwelling in [[Mirkwood]], where the moths were black or dark grey, and grew to a huge size.<ref name=H8>{{H|8}}</ref>

==Names==

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "moth" is ''fufril''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 36</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'', white moths flittered about the head of the dancing [[Lúthien#Other versions of the legendarium|Tinúviel]], as the evening fell. It is told that Tinúviel "''being a [[Fairies|fairy]] minded them not as many of the children of [[Men]] do, although she loved not beetles, and [[spiders]] will none of the [[Eldar]] touch because of [[Ungoliant|Ungweliantë]]''".<ref>{{LT2|I}}, pp. 10-11</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:In [[Peter Jackson]]'s movies, moths are somehow associated with the [[Eagles]]; while [[Gandalf]] is trapped on the summit of [[Orthanc]], he catches a moth and whispers to it. Later, when confronted by [[Saruman]], the moth reappears; an Eagle (supposedly [[Gwaihir]]) arrives and Gandalf escapes on its back.
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Right before the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Gandalf notices a moth flies near him. Then the Eagles appear and help the [[Free Peoples]]. 
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:As [[Thorin and Company]] are trapped in a falling tree by the band of [[Azog]] and their [[Wargs]], Gandalf uses a moth to summon the Eagles to their aid.
