'''Alqualondë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌalkʷaˈlonde]}}), the '''Swanhaven''', was the chief city of the [[Falmari]] on the shores of [[Valinor]].  The city is said to be north and east of [[Tirion]] between the [[Calacirya]] and [[Araman]] in northern [[Eldamar]].

==Description==
The city was built in a natural harbour made of rock, and was also walled. Its entrance was a natural arch. Other than the great harbours it also housed the [[Tower of Olwë]]. The city was covered with the pearls the Elves had found in the sea and jewels which they obtained from the [[Noldor]]. The famed swanships with golden beaks and eyes of jet were moored here.<ref>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Alqualondë.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The First Kinslaying'']]
Alqualondë was built by the [[Falmari]] when they came to [[Aman]]. Its lord was [[Olwe]]. 

When [[Feanor]] rebelled against the will of the [[Valar]], he went to the shores of Aman seeking for a way to reach [[Middle-earth]] and demanded the use of the Telerin ships. The Teleri however refused and resisted when Feanor ordered the [[Noldor]] to take them by force. A battle broke out, the [[First Kinslaying]], in which many Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows, against the fully armed Noldor. They also attempted to block the harbor. The battle was joined by [[Fingon]] and [[Fingolfin]], only because they thought that the Teleri had attacked the Noldor.

In the later years of the [[First Age]], Alqualonde was visited by [[Earendil]] and [[Elwing]] who had reached Valinor. Elwing stayed a little there and told stories to the [[Teleri]] about the griefs of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Alqualondë means "Swanhaven" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[alqua]]'' = "swan", ''[[londë]]'' = "harbor, haven").
