'''Nellas''' was an [[Elves|Elf-maiden]] of [[Doriath]], who lived in the woods near [[Menegroth]]. At the bidding of [[Melian]], she became the friend and tutor of [[Túrin]] during his boyhood years in Doriath. It was from Nellas' teaching that Túrin gained the Elf-like bearing and knowledge of [[Sindarin]] that led the people of [[Nargothrond]] to give him the name [[Adanedhel]], ''Elf-Man''. After Túrin's accidental slaying of [[Saeros]], it was Nellas' account that earned him the forgiveness of the King (though he did not know this, having already exiled himself from the [[Doriath|Hidden Kingdom]]).<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''Túrin in Doriath''</ref>
