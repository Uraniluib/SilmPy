'''Hither Shore''' was a term used especially by the [[Elves]] for the mortal lands of [[Middle-earth]], a reminder of the far distant shores of [[Aman]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref><ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>   

In [[First Age]] [[Sindarin]], it also had a more specific meaning, since it translates into that language as the name [[Nevrast]], a cold seaward region in the northwest of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Nevrast''</ref>
