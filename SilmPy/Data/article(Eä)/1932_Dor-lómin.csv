'''Dor-lómin''' was the southwestern part of [[Hithlum]], bordered in the east by the [[Mountains of Mithrim]], and in the north by the river which formed the [[Cirith Ninniach|Rainbow Cleft]], also known as ''[[Annon-in-Gelydh]]'' ("Gate of the Noldor").<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>

It was first colonized by the [[Noldor]] shortly after they arrived in Middle-earth, and for a long time was ruled by [[Fingon]] son of [[Fingolfin]],<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> before he took over as High King of the Noldor after his father was killed.

By this time the [[Edain]] known as the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]] had entered [[Beleriand]], and Hador Lórindol had "entered the household of Fingolfin in his youth and was loved by the King."<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> Fingolfin granted him the land of Dor-lómin as a fief, and he gathered most of his kin into that land.

[[Húrin]]'s house was built in its southeastern corner near the mountain known as ''[[Amon Darthir]]'', where the river ''[[Nen Lalaith]]'' began.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}</ref>

[[Tuor]] son of [[Huor]] was fostered by the [[Elves]] of [[Androth]] in the Mountains of Mithrim, east of Dor-lómin.<ref name=Turin>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

After the ''[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]'' ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"), the [[House of Hador]] was destroyed or scattered, and [[Easterlings]] dwelt in Dor-lómin.<ref name=Turin/>

Like the rest of Hithlum, it was destroyed during the [[War of Wrath]].<ref name=SIndex>{{S|Index}}</ref>
