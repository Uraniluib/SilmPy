'''Rose "Rosie" Gamgee (née Cotton)''' ({{TA|2984}}<ref name="GamFam"/> - [[Mid-year's Day]] {{FoA|61}}<ref name="Later">{{App|Later}}</ref>) was the daughter of [[Tolman Cotton Senior]] and [[Lily Brown]]. She married [[Samwise Gamgee]] at the end of the [[Third Age]], and bore him a record thirteen children.

==Life==
===Youth===
Rose Cotton was born in the year {{SR|1384|n}} by [[Shire Reckoning]], the second child and first daughter of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Tolman Cotton]] and [[Lily Brown]].<ref name="GamFam">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> The Cotton family lived in a farm on the [[South Lane]], which was fairly close to [[Bywater]].<ref name="HandS612">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (eds.),"Unfinished Index", published (in segments) in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 612</ref> Not much of her youth is known, except that she and her brothers - [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom]], [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Bowman Cotton|Nick]] and [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]] - frequently swam in the [[Bywater Pool]] with the children of the Gamgee family, to which the Cottons were close.<ref name="MtDoom">{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
Rosie was still fond of Sam when both grew to adulthood, and when he announced he'd be going with [[Frodo Baggins]] to [[Crickhollow]], she did not like it.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|VI9}}</ref> Even though everyone had given up hope of seeing Sam - or any of the other [[Travellers|Hobbits]] - back, she waited patiently. Since the Spring of {{TA|3019}}, she had expected Sam to return. 
 
At the time, [[Ruffians|Ruffian]] rule over the Shire had lasted some three months, having started earlier that year.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> Old Tom Cotton had been itching to get his hands on them, but he refrained from doing so as he had his wife and Rosie to look after. Rosie was relieved to find Sam on the doorstep on [[2 November|November 2]]. 

Rosie and her mother tended to Sam, Frodo and several others that night, as they prepared to [[Battle of Bywater|drive out the Ruffians]]. With shining eyes and a smile on her face she heard Frodo tell of Sam's adventure and fame abroad.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|VI8}}</ref> Sam and Frodo lived with the Cottons until [[Bagshot Row]] and [[Bag End]] were restored, the following Spring. Sam later joined Frodo in Bag End, but was torn in two - he wanted to stay loyal to Frodo, as well as marry Rosie.<ref name="Grey"/> 

Frodo solved this problem by telling Sam that he and Rosie would both be welcome to live with him at Bag End after the wedding. Sam and Rosie married on [[1 May|May 1]], {{TA|3020}},<ref name="Chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref> and moved into Bag End.<ref name="Grey"/> There, they lived happily, and begot [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]], their first daughter, who was born on the [[25 March|anniversary of the Downfall of Sauron]].<ref name="Chief"/>

===Fourth Age===
The Fourth Age started with one child, but many more would follow. Rose bore a record thirteen children, beating [[Adamanta Chubb]], the wife of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], by one.<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]] was born in {{FoA|2}}, [[Rose Gardner|Rose-lass]] in {{FoA|4}}, [[Merry Gardner|Merry]] in {{FoA|6}}, [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]] in {{FoA|8}}, [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]] in {{FoA|10}},  [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]] in {{FoA|11}}, [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]] in {{FoA|12}}, [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]] in {{FoA|14}}, [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]] in {{FoA|15}}, [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]] in {{FoA|17}}, [[Robin Gardner|Robin]] in {{FoA|19}}, and their last child, [[Tolman Gardner|Tom]], in {{FoA|21}}.<ref name="GamFam"/>

That year, {{FoA|21|n}}, marked the only major undertaking of Mistress Rose. She and Sam travelled to [[Gondor]], and stayed with [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for well over a year. In the meantime, Rose's brother [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom]] took over Sam's tasks as [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]]. After their return, Rose would continue to live by her husband's side, until her passing at the age of 98 at [[Mid-year's Day]] of {{FoA|61}}.<ref name="Later"/>

==Etymology==
The name '''Rose''' is a translation of an unknown [[Westron]] name. She is, like many female Hobbits, named after a flower,<ref name="OnTrans">{{App|Translation}}</ref> the [[Roses|rose]]. The surname '''Cotton''' comes from a Westron ''Hlothran'', which roughly translates as "Cottager".<ref name="OnTrans"/>

In the [[King's Letter]], which was not included in ''The Return of the King'' as published, [[Aragorn|Elessar]] translated the name Rose as [[Roses#Etymology|'''Meril''']] in [[Sindarin]].<ref name="TheEp">{{SD|XI}}</ref> In his linguistical analysis of the King's Letter, [[Carl F. Hostetter]] noted the resemblance to [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], the queen of [[Tol Eressëa]] in the earliest stages of the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''.<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], ''The "King's Letter": An Historical and Comparative Analysis'', in [[Vinyar Tengwar 31]] (September [[1993]]), pages 12-34</ref> Hostetter could not connect it to any entry in [[The Etymologies]], which mirrors [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s observations on Meril-i-Turinqi, for which no root could be found in the [[Qenya Lexicon]]<ref name="BoLTApp">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', "Appendix: Names in the ''Lost Tales'' - Part 1"</ref> - however, a [[Gnomish]] translation was translated as "Queen of Flowers".<ref name="BoLTApp"/> As the [[Tur|second element]] represents the "queen" part, ''Meril'' appears to be one of the oldest words for "Flower" in the [[legendarium]].
