{{Pronounce|Celebrimbor.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Celebrimbor''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌkɛlɛˈbrɪmbɔr]}}) was the son of [[Curufin]],<ref name=PMXnotes>{{PM|XNotes}}</ref> fifth son of [[Fëanor]]. Aside from his grandfather, Celebrimbor was the greatest craftsman in the history of [[Middle-earth]], and his forging of the [[Rings of Power]] led to the dominion and eventual downfall of [[Sauron]] in the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
=== Early life ===
[[Image:Marya Filatova - Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|left|Marya Filatova - ''Celebrimbor'']]
The early years of Celebrimbor are not known, but probably he was born in [[Valinor]] (and followed his father and grandfather into the [[Exile of the Noldor]] in [[Middle-earth]]. His mother stayed behind.<ref name=PMXnotes/>

He probably fled to [[Nargothrond]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. However, he took no part in the deeds of Curufin and [[Celegorm]] regarding [[Lúthien]], [[Beren]], and [[Finrod]]. He even repudiated his father's deeds and did not follow him when the two brothers were cast out from Nargothrond by [[Orodreth]]. 

After the [[sack of Nargothrond]], Celebrimbor lived for a time in [[Gondolin]], where he was a great jewel smith for King [[Turgon]]. He may have created the [[Elessar of Eärendil]], though other accounts name [[Enerdhil]] as the Master Jewelsmith and creator of the [[Elfstone]], who perhaps taught Celebrimbor this art.<ref name="CG">{{UT|6}}</ref>

A legend says that during the Second Age Celebrimbor was in love with [[Galadriel]] who was pained at the state of [[Middle-earth]]. Celebrimbor remade another version of the Elessar at her behest, with less power than the original.<ref name="CG"/>

During the Second Age, he was lord of the elves of [[Ost-in-Edhil]] in [[Eregion]]. He was also the head of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], a guild of elven craftsmen. Their skill was so renowned that they gained the admiration and friendship of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. Together with the dwarf [[Narvi]], Celebrimbor crafted the [[Doors of Durin]] that guarded the West-gate of the Dwarven kingdom.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

=== The Rings of Power ===
Around {{SA|1200}}<ref name=AppB1/> a [[Maia]] craftsman called [[Annatar]] (the "Lord of Gifts") arrived at Ost-in-Edhil as an emissary of the [[Valar]], offering his knowledge to the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. This was [[Sauron]], who had come to subvert the elves. 

Under the guidance and instruction of Annatar, Celebrimbor and the Gwaith-i-Mírdain made several [[Lesser rings|lesser]] and 16 more powerful rings. A legend says that Celebrimbor gave [[Ring of Thrór|one of those rings]] to [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Durin III]] who reigned in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

Based on knowledge gained from Annatar, Celebrimbor also created by himself [[Three Rings]], the greatest and fairest of the Rings of Power. These rings were thus free of Sauron's corrupting influence, for only Celebrimbor himself touched them. Celebrimbor named the rings [[Vilya]], [[Narya]], and [[Nenya]] after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire, and water, respectively.

Around {{SA|1600}}, Sauron secretly forged [[the One Ring]] in [[Orodruin]], which would enable him to rule Middle-earth by claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers. Celebrimbor and the Elves felt betrayed when they wore the Rings and defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. Celebrimbor then sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]], and Nenya to [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]]. He then prepared for [[War of the Elves and Sauron|war]].

===Fight against Sauron and death===
Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion in {{SA|1695}}, laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the [[Sack of Eregion]], and was forced under torture to disclose where the sixteen were held, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three elvish rings.  Sauron captured the other rings and used them as instruments of evil in later years, particularly against Men.

Celebrimbor died from his torment in {{SA|1697}},<ref name=AppB1>{{App|B1}}</ref> the last direct descendant of the line of Fëanor. His body, shot with arrows, was hung upon a pole and carried by the forces of Sauron as a banner as they assaulted the Elves.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name '''''Celebrimbor''''' is the [[Sindarin]] translation of his [[Quenya]] father-name '''[[Telperinquar]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌtelpeˈriŋʷkʷar]}}). His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] is unknown. ''Celebrimbor'' consists of ''[[celeb|celebrin]]'' ("silver-like") + ''[[paur|baur]]'' ("fist").<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 42</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Celebrimbor was invented for the backstory of the ''Lord of the Rings'' with no background in the [[Lord of the Rings (first edition)|first edition]] (before [[1966]]); afterwards Tolkien attempted to write a background to link him with the [[Elder Days]]: In [[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn|a passage concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]] he was described as a Noldo survivor of Gondolin, who had been one of Turgon's greatest artificers.  He was prideful and had an almost 'dwarvish' obsession with crafts, survived the Fall and later became a follower of Celeborn and Galadriel. However, in a note Tolkien put next to the text, he wrote, "it would be better 'to make him a descendant of Fëanor'." 

Thus, an appropriate line is added in the [[Appendix B]] of the second edition. Tolkien then proceeded to decide which of Feanor's sons would result to Celebrimbor; a note describes their wives and children, stating that, [[Maglor|Maelor]], [[Caranthir]] and Curufin were wedded, concluding that "Curufin, dearest to his father and chief inheritor of his father's skills, [...] had a son who came with him into exile, though his wife (unnamed) did not."<ref name=PMXnotes/> [[Christopher Tolkien]] used this note as a basis for ''The Silmarillion'', where Celebrimbor is the son of Curufin who remained in Nargothrond when his father was expelled.<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> 

However, apparently forgetting the published statement, Tolkien explored other ideas; in [[Vinyar Tengwar 47|an essay]] dated [[1968]] Celebrimbor is referred as a [[Falmari|Telerin]] silver-smith who followed Celeborn to Middle-earth, and ended up to Eregion being fascinated by the silver-like [[mithril]].<ref name=PMXnotes/> In [[Of Dwarves and Men]] ([[1969]] or later) he mentions that he was a [[Sinda]] and descendant of [[Daeron]] of [[Doriath]] who continued to use his [[Cirth|runic script]] in Eregion.<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref>{{rp|297}}<ref name=PMXnotes/>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'''''
:Celebrimbor plays a major role in the video game, serving as a [[wraith]] who is bound to an [[Undead|undead]] [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger]], Talion, by the will of [[Sauron]]. He is voiced by [[Alister Duncan]]. He is also the main protagonist of the ''Bright Lord'' expansion, where he is revealed to have stolen the One Ring from Sauron at some point in the Second Age, and intended to use it to turn the Dark Lord's own weapons against him. However, he is corrupted by the power of the Ring and doomed to never see the Undying Lands. Though he defeats Sauron in battle, Sauron still managed to reclaim the Ring and banish Celebrimbor's spirit to an eternity as a wraith in the Unseen world.
