'''Verna''' was an obscure location in southwest [[Beleriand]] near the [[Mouths of Sirion]].

[[Arvernien]] was named after it.
==Inspiration==
Verna does not appear in narration or any maps of Beleriand; [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] appears to have invented the name in order to explain the etymology of ''Arvernien''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 19</ref> Since Tolkien explains Arvernien as "Land beside Verna", geographically, Verna could refer to adjacent regions like the forest of [[Nimbrethil]] or [[Lisgardh]].

==Etymology==
Verna could be related to [[Quenya]] ''[[feren]]'' which means "birch, beech tree", and if so, it could refer to the forest of Nimbrethil ("(forest of) silver birches").<ref>This connection was suggested by the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]], and it referred to ''Arvernien'', without acknowledging the existence of ''Verna'' as an independent word[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/arvernien.html].</ref> Another possibility is that it refers to a river, obviously [[Sirion]], and comes from the [[SundocarmÃ«|Root]] ''[[WER]]'', "winding" (thus, "Winding River").<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/34598 Message 34598]'', [[Elfling]]</ref>
