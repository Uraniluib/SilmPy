The '''Cross-roads of the Fallen King''' was the point in the land of [[Ithilien]] where the north-south [[Harad Road]] was crossed by the east-west road from [[Osgiliath]] to [[Minas Ithil]] (later [[Minas Morgul]]).<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>  
==History==
Originally maintained by the [[Gondorians|Men of Gondor]], who grew tall trees and built a statue of a [[Kings of Gondor|king]], the Cross-roads had effectively fallen under the control of [[Sauron]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Orcs]] had befouled the statue; its head had been knocked off and replaced by a stone effigy.

On their way to [[Mordor]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] came to the Cross-roads around [[March 10]]. They were in a belt of trees of vast size. Next to the road leading to [[Osgiliath]] they found the defiled statue, but seeing its fallen head gave Frodo hope, for nature crowned it with flowers.<ref>{{TT|IV7}}</ref>

Sometime later, in the evening of [[March 18]], a vanguard of [[Army of the West]] passed by the Cross-roads. [[Aragorn]] ordered a fanfare of trumpeteers and ceremoniously reclaimed the lands in the name of the Lords of Gondor. Soldiers broke the defiling stone-head and restored the statue also washing the scrawls away.

The [[March 19|next day]] they were joined by the main Host. Before leaving, they stationed a strong force of archers there, to guard against any attack from the East or South, and resumed their course towards [[Mordor]].<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>
