The '''Bounders''' were responsible for policing the borders of [[the Shire]] and ensuring that outsiders behaved themselves. This was known as 'beating the bounds'. The Bounders was the larger of the two branches of the [[Watch]] (the other being the twelve [[Shirriffs]]).

The number of Bounders at any given time was not fixed but varied according to need. In the run up to the [[War of the Ring]] they were greatly increased as [[ruffians]] and spies of [[Isengard]] and [[Mordor]] began to enter [[Eriador]]. Unbeknownst to the Hobbits of the Shire this was the first sign that the troubles of the south would soon reach even their borders.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The word means "persons watching the boundaries". 

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the word was rare, probably because in the late 19th century slang it meant an offensively pushing and in-bred man.<ref name="Nomen">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]" in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', pp. 753-4</ref>
