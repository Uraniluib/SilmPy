'''Legolas''' was an [[Elf]] of [[Gondolin]].

== History ==
He was one of the [[House of the Tree]], a scout under [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]].  Because of his keen eyes and knowledge of the mountainous area, he was chosen by the escapees of the [[Fall of Gondolin]] to be in front and guide them across the [[Cirith Thoronath|Cristhorn]].<ref name="III">{{LT2|III}}</ref>

Following the fall, he moved to [[Tol Eressëa]], where he took the name Laiqalassë.<ref name="IIIn">{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The meaning of ''Legolas'' was twofold: it could mean "Greenleaf" from [[Gnomish]] ''laigos'' ("greenness") and ''las'' ("leaf"), as well as "Keen sight", from ''leg, lêg'' ("keen, piercing") and ''last'' ("look, glance").<ref name="app">{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>
