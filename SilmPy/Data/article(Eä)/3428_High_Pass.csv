The '''High Pass''' was a pass over the [[Misty Mountains]]. On its western end was the refuge of [[Rivendell]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], "[[Index questions]]"; cf. {{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref> and from there the [[East Road]] climbed into the mountains until it reached the mountain under which lied the [[Goblin-town]].

There were actually two passes at this location. The lower pass was more prone to being blocked by Orcs, hence most travellers used the higher pass outside of those rare occasions when the Orcs were suppressed.

==History==
The High Pass was first created during the [[First Age]] by [[Oromë]] the [[Valar|Vala]], in order to allow for a crossing of the mountains by the [[Eldar]].{{fact}}

Later the High Pass was used by the [[Dwarves]], who connected their roads (the [[East Road]] and the [[Men-i-Naugrim]] through [[Mirkwood]]) with it.<ref>{{UT|7}}, note 14</ref>

In the [[Second Age]] the High Pass was used by the army of [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]] when they marched to [[Mordor]] in the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. After this war [[Isildur]] was slain by [[Orcs]] watching the way towards the pass.<ref name=gladden/>

The Pass became dangerous again because of the Orcs. Only with the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], which nearly wiped out all Orcs of the mountains, did it became safe again. Nevertheless in {{TA|2940}}, the goblins of [[Goblin-town]] had burrowed their way back to it, and [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the Dwarves of [[Thorin]] were captured the next year during the [[Quest of Erebor]].<ref>{{H|Over}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Grimbeorn|Grimbeorn the Old]] and the [[Beornings]] kept the High Pass open,<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> but the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] bypassed the High Pass because the eastern side of the Misty Mountains had become too dangerous.

==Names==
The High Pass was also known as the '''''Pass of Imladris'''''. In [[Sindarin]], the pass was called '''''Cirith Forn en Andrath''''' ("the high-climbing pass of the north"); ''[[cirith]]'' + ''[[forn (Sindarin)|forn]]'' + ''[[andrath (word)|andrath]]'').<ref name=gladden>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the draft for the chapter, "[[The Ring Goes South]]", [[Elrond]] gave a name for both the High Pass and the [[Front Porch|Goblin Gate]], which was ''Annerchin''.<ref>{{RS|Ring}}</ref>
