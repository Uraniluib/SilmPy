'''Erestor''' was an Elf of [[Rivendell]].

==History==
Erestor was the chief counsellor of [[Elrond]]'s household at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]; as such, he took part in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He did not support the idea of destroying [[The One Ring|The Ring]], and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from [[Sauron]], perhaps with the aid of [[Tom Bombadil|Iarwain ben-adar]]. His suggestion was countered by [[Glorfindel]], as well as [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]], as they didn't believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Sauron's.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

Erestor accompanied [[Arwen]] to her marriage to [[Gondor]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>
