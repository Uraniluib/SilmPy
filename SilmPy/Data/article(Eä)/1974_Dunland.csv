'''Dunland''' was a part of [[Enedwaith]] east of the [[North-South Road]], well south of the [[Glanduin]] and north of the [[Isen]]. It was a foothill region that fronted the western slopes of the southern [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Far from the centres of population of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], its inhabitants at times included the [[Men]] known as [[Dunlendings]] as well as wandering [[Hobbits]] and [[Dwarves]].

Dunland was a fair, fertile land. By the end of the [[Third Age]] being neither prosperous or civilised, it was sparsely inhabited by unorganised herdsmen and hillmen.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Dunland"</ref>

==History==
===The First Men in Dunland===
In the early [[Second Age]], Dunland first acquired a significant population of [[Men]] when those who had dwelt in the forests of Enedwaith south of the [[Gwathló]] fled from the [[Númenóreans]] after they began to cut down all of the trees.<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref>

When the kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] were established early in the [[Third Age]] the land of Enedwaith (and the region of Dunland) were largely ignored, although the inhabitants were nominally subjects of Gondor.<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>  

===The Stoors Stay in Dunland===
About {{TA|1150}} the Hobbit-breed known as the [[Stoors]] left their early homeland in the upper vales of the [[Anduin]] and crossed the [[Caradhras#The Redhorn Gate|Redhorn Pass]]. Some settled in the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle]] and others travelled down the [[Bruinen|Loudwater]] and settled in Dunland.  While the Stoors in the Angle vacated that area in {{TA|1356|n}}, those living in Dunland remained until around {{TA|1630|n}} when they migrated to the newly founded [[The Shire|Shire]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

===The Middle Years of the Third Age===
The  [[Great Plague]] swept through the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] in the years {{TA|1636}} – {{TA|1637|n}}.<ref name="TA"/> Dunland suffered, but to a lesser extent than in other regions due to their self-isolation. After the end of the royal line in Gondor the Dunlendings ceased to be subjects of the realm. During the years of the [[Watchful Peace]] ({{TA|1975|n}} – {{TA|2050|n}}), as the people of [[Calenardhon]] dwindled, the Dunlendings began drifting across the [[Isen]].

The expansion of the Dunlendings to the southeast of Dunland was checked when the new realm of [[Rohan]] was established in {{TA|2510|n}}. In the subsequent centuries there was tension between the Dunlendings and the [[Rohirrim]], which reached open war in the time of [[Helm Hammerhand]].

Guarding the [[Gap of Rohan]] was the fortress of [[Isengard]], where a hereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had become hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, in {{TA|2759}}<ref name="TA"/> Beren gave [[Saruman]] the keys to [[Orthanc]], to guard Isengard for Gondor.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

===The Dwarves in Dunland===
In {{TA|2770}}, [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] destroyed the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name="TA"/>  Dwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from where [[Thrór]] departed when he and his companion [[Nár]] journeyed to [[Moria]] in {{TA|2790}}. After the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], provoked by the [[Orcs]]' brutal slaying of Thrór, [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and [[Thorin]] led the remnants of their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle in the [[Ered Luin]]).<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===The Later Third Age===
Beren's decision to trust Saruman however had severe consequences, as before and around the [[War of the Ring]], the Wizard inflamed the Dunlendings' grievance and enmity to the Rohirrim<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref> and concentrated a great military force which besieged them at the [[Helm's Deep]]. After the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], the Rohirrim allowed the surviving Dunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the [[Isen]] river again.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

After the War the four Hobbits, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], with the company of [[Gandalf]], [[Celeborn]], [[Galadriel]], and others journeyed through Dunland on their way home.  While traversing the region they met two beggars, Saruman and [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Dunland meant "Hill Land" in the language of neighbouring [[Rohan]], whose people named it after arriving in nearby [[Calenardhon]] in the later [[Third Age]].  ''Dunland'' is understood as "Brownland" ([[Old English]] ''dunn'' means "brown, dusky, dull"), referring to its inhabitants being swarthy and dark-haired .  The element ''dunn'' had no relation to the [[Elvish]] root ''[[dûn]]'' meaning "west".<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Dunland is mentioned when a flock of ''Crebain'' appears when the Fellowship is in [[Hollin]]; and [[Legolas]] identifies them as such and being from Dunland.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Ring Goes South (scene)|The Ring Goes South]]"</ref> The ''crebain'' later report to Saruman at Isengard.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Fighting Uruk-hai]]"</ref>
'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dunland is a massive region available for exploration, with three key areas: Dunland (proper), The [[Gap of Rohan]], and [[Nan Curunír]]. Many tribes of the Dunlendings exist, with some warring against one another, or fighting against the [[White Hand]]. Dunland's largest and chief town/village is Galtrev.
