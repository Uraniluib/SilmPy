'''Slinker''' was [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]'s name for the pathetic, whimpering side to [[Gollum]]'s personality, faithful to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and desperate for his approval. Gollum's 'Slinker' persona was associated with his original life as the hobbit-like creature [[Sm√©agol]], long ago on the banks of the [[Gladden River]] before the Ring began to twist his mind. Slinker fought a failing fight for control of Gollum against his darker, more dangerous side, 'Stinker'. As he led Frodo and Sam into [[Mordor]], Slinker gradually faded away, and the deadly, Ring-obsessed Stinker took over Gollum completely.<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref>
