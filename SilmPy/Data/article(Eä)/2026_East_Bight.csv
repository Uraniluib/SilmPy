'''East Bight''' was the great indentation in the eastern edge of [[Mirkwood]], a treeless region that was roughly square in shape, some fifty miles to a side, towards the southern end of the wood. The "Bight" was not a natural formation, but rather the result of generations of forestry by the [[Northmen]] who had historically occupied the lands east of the Forest, from whom the [[Éothéod]] could claim descent. Because of the Bight, that part of Mirkwood immediately to the north of [[Amon Lanc]] was less than one hundred miles across, and so it became known as the [[Narrows of the Forest]].<ref>{{HM|UT}}</ref>
