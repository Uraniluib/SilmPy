'''Inner Seas''' is a concept that refers to different bodies of water in different Ages of [[Arda]].

==Inner Seas in the earliest times of Arda==
The Inner Seas in the very beginning of Arda were [[Belegaer]] and the [[East Sea]], the two oceans between the two outer continents ([[Aman]] in the West and the [[Land of the Sun]] in the East), and [[Middle-earth]] proper, contrary to the [[Outer Sea]] that extended from the edges to the nether side of Arda.

When [[Ulmo]] came to Arda with his [[Maiar]], he gave to [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]] "the government of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas", while he personally abode in the Outer Sea.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>

In the [[Ambarkanta]] the Inner Seas, or "the ancient seas", are described as laying "in troughs" between the central continent and the western and eastern lands, and their waters only spilled into the chasm in north and south, where they had no shores.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 238.</ref>

==Inner seas in the Second Age==
When the [[Dúnedain]] could not go very far to the West from [[Númenor]] because of the [[Ban of the Valar]] they are told to have sailed eastward from North to South and they 
"came even into the inner seas, and sailed about Middle-earth and glimpsed from their high prows the [[Gates of Morning]] in the East".<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

These "inner seas" were reached ''from'' the Belegaer and therefore must have referred to something quite else than the great Inner Seas of the beginning of days.

The answer may be found from the [[Ambarkanta maps|Ambarkanta Map V]] which depicts the geography of Arda after the destruction of the [[Lamps of the Valar]]:<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 251.</ref> in the places where the Lamps stood, had been formed two great bodies of water, the "Inland Sea" or the [[Sea of Helcar]] in the North, and the "East Sea" in the South. Especially the East Sea, to the south of which was the [[Dark Land]], offered a route from the Belegaer to the great eastern ocean &ndash; also named as the [[East Sea]], in the Ambarkanta Map IV.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 249.</ref>

Note that the "East Sea" of the Ambarkanta Map V was named as "Inner Seas" by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] in the map that describes the voyages of the Dúnedain in the Second Age, obviously based on the mention in the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' and disregarding the name Tolkien himself gave to the sea.<ref>Karen Wynn Fonstad, ''[[Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', Revised Edition, p. 45.</ref>
