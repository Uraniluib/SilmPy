'''Durthang''' was an old fortress in the northern [[Mordor]]. It stood in the northern [[Ephel Dúath]], on the slopes above [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]], overlooking [[Morannon]] and the [[Carach Angren|Isenmouthe]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==History==
Durthang was originally a stronghold of [[Gondor]], constructed during the early [[Third Age]] for overlooking the entrance to [[Mordor]] in the aftermath of the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. However, as Gondor’s power declined, Durthang was eventually abandoned, and by {{TA|1640}} Mordor was left unguarded.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> The land became repopulated with Sauron’s servants, and Durthang eventually became an [[Orcs|Orcish]] stronghold.

During the [[War of the Ring]], a troop of Orcs from Durthang caught up with a band of Orcs that was marching eastward in Mordor. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] were in that band, disguised as Orcs and they were forced to march along with the troop for some distance before they were able to slip away.<ref>{{RK|VI2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Durthang'' is [[Sindarin]] containing the elements ''[[dûr]]'' "dark" and ''[[thang]]'' "oppression".<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>
