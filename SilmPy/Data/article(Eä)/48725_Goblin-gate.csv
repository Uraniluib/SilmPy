[[File:Ted Nasmith - Goblin Gate.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Goblin Gate'']]The '''Goblin-gate''', also known as '''Back-door'''<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 29</ref> by the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]], was a stone door serving as the lower eastern passage to the [[Goblin-town]] in the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=h6>{{H|6}}</ref> It was located near the [[Eagle's Eyrie]] and west of the [[Carrock]].<ref>{{H|WM}}</ref>

The gate was built by the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] "ages" ago both as a means of escape from their tunnels and as a way to access and harass the [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. It was always guarded.<ref name=h6/>
 
[[Gandalf]] led [[Thorin and Company]] through that exit to escape the goblins. [[Bilbo Baggins]] also escaped from [[Gollum]] by squeezing through that stone door and losing his buttons.<ref>{{H|5}}</ref>
