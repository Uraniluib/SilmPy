'''Thû''', the Necromancer and Lord of Werewolves, was a character that is featured in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' the early writings that would evolve into the ''[[Silmarillion]]''. Thû would later evolve into the character of '''[[Sauron]]'''.

== Tu or Tuvon ==
The earliest appearance of the figure of Thû, was as a [[sprites|fay]] in [[Gilfanon's Tale]], called Tu or Tuvon. Tu's origins are not developed, other than that he was the greatest wizard/magician in the world, and his dwelling was in deep caves near the waters that fed the [[Waters of Awakening]]. He taught lore and [[magic]] to the [[Dark Elves]], and ruled the [[Hisildi]].

His appearance is connected to the story of the [[Awakening of Men]]; he interprets the will of [[Ilúvatar]], and warns [[Nuin]] that the time of [[Men]] had not come before the rising of the [[Sun]]. Afterwards, when the Sun rises, he assists and shepherds the first Men with Nuin; but Tu has to hide in his caves as the sunlight weakens him. Although in this story he is not evil, [[Tolkien]] intended Tu to become the enemy of Men when some of them turn against his [[Elves]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>

== Thû ==
Thû, as a villain, becomes the Lord of the Werewolves, replacing an earlier villain, [[Tevildo]], the Lord of Cats. 

In the [[Lay of Leithian]] Thû holds the [[Wizard's Isle]] and spots [[Beren]] and [[Felagund]]. After he interrogates them, he engages with Felagund into a battle of mind and songs, until Felagund's power fell, and they returned to their own original forms. Thû then places them in his dungeons sending a werewolf to devour one of them, hoping to learn their errand.<ref>{{LB|C7}}</ref> Later he sends werewolves, and [[Draugluin]] against [[Lúthien]] and [[Huan]], and takes the form of the greatest werewolf to defeat him. However Huan bites him on his throats and is obliged to give them the keys to his tower. He then transforms into a [[vampire]] and flees.<ref>{{LB|C9}}</ref>

In subsequent stories, his name evolved to '''Gorthû''', '''Sûr''', and finally to '''[[Sauron]]'''.

In another source, Thū is given as a [[Sindarin]] translation of Súlimo, an epithet of [[Manwe]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 124</ref>
