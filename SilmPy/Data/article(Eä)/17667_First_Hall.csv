The '''First Hall''' of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] was on the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]], above the [[Dimrill Dale]] and apparently the first hall built by [[Durin I]].  The [[Great Gates|East-gate]] of Moria led right into the First Hall, and from this space there was a wide passage and stairs leading to the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]], the [[Second Hall]], and the rest of the city.  In contrast to much of Khazad-dûm, the First Hall was brightly lit due to high windows on the eastern side.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>  After the fall of [[Gandalf]], the remaining members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] ran through the First Hall to escape from Moria on [[January 15]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
