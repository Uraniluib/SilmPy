'''Grip''' was a large wolf-like [[Dogs|dog]], one of three kept by [[Farmer Maggot]] on his farm at [[Bamfurlong]] in the [[Marish]]. Like Maggot's other dogs, [[Fang (dog)|Fang]] and [[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]], Grip was ferocious by nature, but also completely obedient to his master. Grip was with Maggot when they encountered one of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] searching for '[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]', and at that time his obedience and ferocity failed: he yelped in terror and ran from the [[Nazgûl]].<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>
