The four '''Farthings''' were four of the five (later six) divisions of [[the Shire]]. They were known simply as [[Northfarthing]], [[Westfarthing]], [[Southfarthing]] and [[Eastfarthing]].<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RK}}</ref> The [[Westron]] word was ''[[tharni]]'', the [[Sindarin]] word (presumably) ''[[canath]]''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §41</ref>  
==Etymology==
In English a farthing ([[Old English]] ''feorðing'' "fourth part, quarter" > ''ferthing'' "a negligible amount") is a quarter of a penny.<ref name="Nomen"/>

In Shire geography used in the original sense "fourth part". [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the application to the divisions of the Shire to English ears has a perhaps comical effect.<ref name="Nomen"/>

==Inspiration==
The four Farthings of the Shire were based on the three traditional Ridings (from the Old English ''thridings'') of [[Wikipedia:Yorkshire|Yorkshire]], which were formerly used as administrative divisions of the county ([[wikipedia:North Riding of Yorkshire|North Riding]], [[wikipedia:West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] and [[wikipedia:East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]]).<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 770 (see also p. 32)</ref><ref>{{WP|Riding (division)}}</ref>

"Farthing" was used in Gloucestershire. Tolkien did not mention this in ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]'', but it is likely he knew of its existence as his wife [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]] was born in Gloucestershire.
