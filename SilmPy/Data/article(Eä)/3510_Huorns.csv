'''Huorns''' were creatures much like [[Ents]], although they do not appear to have been truly sentient.

==History==

The origin of the Huorns is unknown. It is not clear if Huorns were Ents that had become tree-like, or trees that had become Entish. Perhaps both varieties existed, though the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] believed the former was true.<ref name=Flotsam/> Either way it is obvious they were part way between trees and Ents.<ref>[[David Day]] (1996), ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'', p. 142</ref>

In the [[Third Age]], the Huorns lived in [[Fangorn Forest]],<ref name=Flotsam/> though it is possible that the trees of the [[Old Forest]], especially [[Old Man Willow]], were Huorns as well.

During the [[War of the Ring]], Huorns were aroused by [[Treebeard]] to destroy [[Nan Curun√≠r]].<ref name=Flotsam/> Gandalf saw the shadow of these Huorns, as he rode with the host from [[Edoras]] to [[Hornburg]].<ref>{{HM|Scheme}}, p. 412</ref><ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref> Directed by the Ents, the Huorns also helped the [[Rohirrim]] to fight the [[Orcs]] at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=Flotsam/>

==Characteristics==

Huorns had great power and could wrap themselves in shadow. When angry, they were able to move with great speed. The Huorns further had voices, as they could speak with the Ents. When no Ents looked after them, the Huorns were "''queer and wild''", a threat to the [[Free peoples]].<ref name=Flotsam/>

==Etymology==

[[Carl F. Hostetter]] has suggested that ''Huorn'' is a [[Quenya]] word meaning "talking tree".<ref>{{VT|50a}}, p. 17</ref>

The first element of ''huorn'' might be derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHUG-]], and the second element is [[Sindarin]] ''[[orn]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 425</ref>

Apparently, there was also a much longer [[Entish]] word for ''huorn''.<ref name=Flotsam>{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Huorns are classified as Animate Plants (Monsters). The evil, "blackhearted" ones, went away from Fangorn Forest and the protection of the Ents and settled in Mirkwood. Huorns eat living beings, and they come in as many different forms as trees do. Old Man Willow is a Huorn of the Old Forest.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref>

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
: Huorn is an Awakened Plant (Creature), able to inflict one strike on a player.
