'''Thrushes''' are large speckled brown birds with a special fondness for snails, whose shells they remove by breaking them against stones.  The thrush that [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] encountered on the [[Lonely Mountain]] was unusually large and nearly black with dark spots on its pale yellow breast.<ref name="Doorstep">{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>  [[Thorin]] stated that it was a member of an ancient breed, long lived and magical.<ref name="Inside">{{H|Inside}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the thrush on the Lonely Mountain was instrumental in the downfall of [[Smaug]].  On [[Thrór's Map]], the [[Moon-letters]] instructions said to "Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks" on [[Durin's Day]] to see the magic key-hole.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>  Sure enough, when Durin's Day arrived this thrush knocked a snail on the grey stone in the small rocky alcove on the Mountain, which alerted the company to watch for the appearance of the keyhole and [[Back Door|secret door]].<ref name="Doorstep"/>

The men of [[Lake-men|Lake-town]] and [[Men of Dale|Dale]] could understand the language of the thrushes, and some thrushes could understand the [[Westron|common tongue]].  Fortunately the thrush on the Mountain was one of them for he was able to understand Bilbo's account of his talk with Smaug and hear about the bare patch on the [[Dragons|dragon]]'s breast.<ref name="Inside"/>  On the night when Smaug attacked [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] the thrush spoke to [[Bard]] and revealed the vulnerable part on the monster.  Bard was able to pierce the dragon with his arrow with this knowledge.<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>

After the Dwarves and the Hobbit had escaped from the mountain to [[Ravenhill]] the thrush returned with the news of Smaug's demise.  Finding that none could understand his speech, the thrush left and brought back the raven [[Roäc]] who could translate the thrush's words.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>  After this exchange of information the thrush vanished from the scene.

==Inspiration==
In ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', a raven and a [[Finches|finch]] speak two of the verses,<ref>{{HM|SG}}, pp. 116-117, 214-215</ref> reminiscent of the sentient thrushes and [[ravens]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the earliest version of Thrór's Map (called "Fimbulfambi's Map" by [[John D. Rateliff]] in ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' since that was Thrór's original designation) the [[Moon-letters]] said to "Stand by the grey stone when the ''crow'' knocks…".  This was soon changed to ''thrush''.<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, pp. 22-23</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Given gaming statistics, the Thrushes are among Radagast's principal agents and are friends of the Northmen. The thrush language, which can be learned by Elves and Men but not by Dwarves, is called "Throsel-tunge".<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2016}}</ref>
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Towards the end, a thrush appears to the Dwarves and it is considered as a sign of hope. The bird flies to the Lonely Mountain and breaks an nut, which wakes Smaug.
