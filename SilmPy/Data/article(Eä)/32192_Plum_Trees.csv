'''Plum trees''' were some of the fruit-bearing trees cultivated in [[the Shire]].  In the marvelous year of {{SR|1420}} it was said that young [[Hobbits]] "sat on the lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror".<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
