'''Thargelion''', earlier known as '''Talath Rhúnen'''<ref name=bel>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and later known as '''Dor Caranthir''', was a flat wooded region of [[East Beleriand]], east of the river [[Gelion]], bordering the [[Blue Mountains]]. It was north of the river [[Ascar]], and therefore not counted as part of [[Ossiriand]]. Its northern end was Lake [[Helevorn]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> 
==History==
The [[Sindar]] called this land ''Talath Rhúnen''. After the Rebellion of the [[Noldor]] this was the land of [[Caranthir]], one of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], and after him it was often called ''Dor Caranthir'', "Caranthir's Land". There Caranthir met the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]].<ref name=bel/>

The [[Haladin]] briefly dwelt here independently, near the river Ascar, until they were nearly wiped out in an [[Orcs|Orc]]-raid. Caranthir offered to their leader, [[Haleth]], part of his land, but she refused and instead she led her people to [[Brethil]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

During the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Orcs broke the defenses of [[Maglor's Gap]] defiled Helevorn and ravaged all Thargelion. Caranthir fled to the south.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Caranthir later gave some of his former lands to [[Uldor]].<ref>[[The Second 'Silmarillion' Map]]</ref>

==Etymology==
''Thargelion'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''thar-'' ("across, over") and ''[[Gelion#Etymology|Gelion]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 34</ref>

''[[Talath]] [[Rhûn|Rhún]]en'' is glossed as "East Vale".<ref name=bel/><ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>
