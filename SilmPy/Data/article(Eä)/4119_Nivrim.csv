'''Nivrim''' was a narrow woodland composed of mostly [[oak]]s, that lay north of the [[Aelin-uial]] and extending to [[Taeglin]].  It was the only part of the kingdom of [[Doriath]] west of the River [[Sirion]] and was encompassed within the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>  A guarded bridge crossed Sirion just south of the inflow of [[Esgalduin]], connecting the land with the rest of Doriath. [[Mablung]] and three companions were leading [[Nienor]] to this bridge but were assailed by [[Orcs]] when they rested, and Nienor ran away.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
