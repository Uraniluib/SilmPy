'''Darkening of Valinor''' was the destruction of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], by [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]] in {{YT|1495}}. The fifty [[Valian Years]] between the Darkening and the rising of the [[Sun]] was known as the '''Long Night'''.<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

After Melkor sowed discord among the [[Noldor]] and fled Valinor, [[Manwë]] held a feast for the reconciliation of the Eldar. There [[Fingolfin]] publicly forgave [[Fëanor]]. In the meantime, the Dark Lord found [[Ungoliant]] in [[Avathar]] and asked her aid against his enemies. Ungoliant helped Melkor infiltrate Valinor by shrouding both herself and her ally in webs of pure darkness. Once within Valinor, Ungoliant drank the light from the Two Trees after Morgoth wounded them with his spear. She also drained dry the Wells of Varda so that nothing remained of the Light of the Two Lamps save that of the Silmarils of Fëanor.<ref>{{S|8}}</ref> 

{{quote|Then the Unlight of Ungoliant rose up even to the roots of the Trees, and Melkor sprang upon the mound; and with his black spear he smote each Tree to its core, wounded them deep, and their sap poured forth as it were their blood, and was spilled upon the ground. But Ungoliant sucked it up, and going then from Tree to Tree she set her black beak to their wounds, till they were drained; and the poison of Death that was in her went into their tissues and withered them, root, branch and leaf; and they died.|[[The Silmarillion]], [[Of the Darkening of Valinor]]}}
==The Long Night==
After this terrible act, Ungoliant and Melkor fled to escape justice at the hands of the Valar. They killed [[Finwë]] in [[Formenos]] and stole the [[Silmarils]]. Enraged, [[Fëanor]] refused to surrender the Silmarils to revive the [[Two Trees]], and when he learned about their theft, he rebelled against the [[Valar]]. He persuaded many Elves to go with him to [[Middle-earth]] and the [[Flight of the Noldor]] began, but when he demanded the [[swan-ships]] of the [[Falmari]], he resolved to the [[First Kinslaying]] to steal them. This event caused the [[Fall of the Noldor]].

During the Flight, [[Mandos]] (or his messenger) appeared before them and spoke the [[Doom of Mandos]]. [[Finarfin]] abandoned the host, but the [[Sons of Fëanor]] responded with the [[Oath of Fëanor]].

In [[Beleriand]], [[Orcs]] besieged the [[Havens of the Falas]]; the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] occurred. The [[Sindar]] withdrew in [[Doriath]], inside the [[Girdle of Melian]] that was set around. The [[Laiquendi]] also remained hidden. Soon after, the Noldor arrived and Feanor was killed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]]. [[Maedhros]] was also captured and chained on the [[Thangorodrim]]. The Noldor refused to depart and camped at [[Mithrim]]. 

The remaining host of the Noldor under Fingolfin crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] and entered [[Beleriand]] to engage in the [[Battle of the Lammoth]]. The Moon rose and after seven times, the Sun followed.
