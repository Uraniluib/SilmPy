'''Nicholas Guildford''' (born in [[1937]]) was a member of the [[Notion Club]].

== History ==
Guildford was an archaeologist and the Club reporter. He was seldom recorded as reading anything to the Club, and it was then not reported; but he appears to have written several novels.<ref name="Foreword">{{SD|2b}}</ref>

In one of the meetings, after [[Michael George Ramer|Ramer]] had finished reading his story, Guildford criticized it for not having a convincing method of transportation across the space, deeming it highly unlikely or even impossible for humans to ever (in flesh) get to another planet.<ref>{{SD|2c}}, "Night 60"</ref>

When [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham|Lowdham]] and [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy|Jeremy]] went on a journey after the ''Night 67'', during which a [[wikipedia:Great Storm of 1987|great storm]] hit [[wikipedia:England|England]], and in which Lowdham and Jeremy seemed to have received a vision of a sort of the [[Downfall of NÃºmenor]]<ref>{{SD|2d}}, "Night 67"</ref>, he was the one who received a letter from the two, stating they were still "researching" and that "more stuff may come through".<ref>{{SD|2d}}, "Night 68"</ref>

== Inspiration ==
It had been shown to the editor of the [[Notion Club Papers]], Mr. [[Howard Green]], by a historian [[J.R. Titmass]], that the name of ''Nicholas Guildford'' was derived from an old medieval text titled ''[[wikipedia:The Owl and the Nightingale|The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' and that it was a pseudonym.<ref name="Foreword"/>
