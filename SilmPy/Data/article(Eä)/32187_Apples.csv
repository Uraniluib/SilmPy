{{quote|I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!  My tub was full of it.  To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening.  I could eat anything in the wide world now, for hours on end - but not an apple!|[[Fíli]]<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>}}
'''Apples''' were the fruits of apple trees cultivated in [[the Shire]] and in [[Bree-land]]. [[Bilbo Baggins]] served apple-tart to [[Bifur]] at the [[An Unexpected Party|Unexpected Party]].<ref>{{H|1}}.</ref> Before [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] left the Shire he noticed how fine the weather had been, such that "the trees were laden with apples".<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>  When [[Aragorn|Strider]] led the hobbits from [[Bree]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam Gamgee]] chewed on one of the apples given to him by [[Nob]] and [[Bob]] at [[the Prancing Pony]].  Apples were so much a part of the diet of [[Hobbits]] that Sam recited a proverb: "Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting."  As the party passed the house of the scornful [[Bill Ferny]], Sam chucked an apple at him and struck Bill square on the nose.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

Apple trees are not directly mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' but one of the men of Bree was [[Rowlie Appledore]], whose last name was an old English word for "apple tree".<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>

==Names==
The [[Sindarin]] translation of the name ''[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]'' is ''Cordof''.<ref>{{SD|XI2}}, pp. 129-31</ref> As [[Wikipedia:Cox's Orange Pippin|pippin]] is a kind of apple, it has been suggested that ''cordof'' refers to a "small red apple".<ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] (accessed 24 March 2011)</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''

In the movie Sam does not eat any apples and he does not throw one at Bill Ferny.  However, in Scene 16, "The Nazgûl", when the hobbits start to prepare a breakfast Strider tells them, "Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall."  Startled, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] asks, "What about second breakfast?"  Strider says nothing and walks on.  Soon though he tosses an apple from behind a bush, which [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] catches.  A second tossed apple smacks Pippin in the forehead.
