'''Marcho''' was a [[Bree-hobbits|Bree-hobbit]] of [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] stock. He was the brother of [[Blanco]]. 

==History==
In {{TA|1601}}, Marcho and his the brother [[Blanco]] led a group of mostly [[Harfoots|Harfoot]] [[hobbits]] westwards from [[Bree]]. They crossed [[Baranduin]] and with the permission of [[King of Arthedain|King]] [[Argeleb II]] they settled in the royal hunting grounds of [[Arthedain]] and founded [[the Shire]]. Soon after (c. {{TA|1630}}), [[Stoors]] from [[Dunland]] came to this new land.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[Old English]] and Celtic ''marka'' is an element that refers to "horse" (see ''[[mearas]]'').
