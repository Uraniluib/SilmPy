The '''Lesser Market''' of '''[[Gondolin]]''' was a market in the south of Gondolin smaller than the [[Great Market]].  During the [[Fall of Gondolin]] [[Turgon]] ordered [[Salgant]] to the Great Market to reinforce [[Glorfindel of Gondolin|Glorfindel]], but being deep in the council of [[Maeglin]] he tried to take his company, the [[House of the Harp]], to the Lesser Market.  But they rebelled from his orders, and therefore never came to this market.
