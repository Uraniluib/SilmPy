'''Longbottom Leaf''' was one of the three varieties of pipe-weed recorded as being the most sought-after, the other two being [[Old Toby]] and [[Southern Star]]. 

[[Longbottom]] in the [[Southfarthing]] was the first place in [[the Shire]] where pipe-weed was grown, and so Longbottom Leaf must have been one of the oldest and most established types (if not the original variety). The first Leaf-grower was [[Tobold Hornblower]], and his family continued the tradition.<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> 

Barrels of Longbottom Leaf were stashed by [[Saruman]] in [[Isengard]]. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] who found the barrels in its ruins, noticed the brand-marks of the [[Hornblower Family]] and the date {{SR|1417}}.<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The smoke from Longbottom Leaf takes the form of a horizontal smoke ring that appears behind the character's head. This effect appears to be broken or bugged. From the front, only the default cloud of thick smoke can be seen.
