__NOTOC__
'''-il''' is a little-attested ending in the [[Sindarin]] language,<ref group="note">Some of the examples refer to [[Noldorin]] as well</ref> used sometimes to denote feminine gender. Its masculine counterpart is ''[[-on]]''.

Its presence causes [[i-affection]] to the vowels of the stem (cf. ''[[brannon]]'' and ''[[brennil|br'''e'''nn'''i'''l]]'').
==Etymology==
Possibly it derives from a [[Common Eldarin]] ending *''-illê''. This is supported by several [[Quenya]] words which end in ''-illë'' with Sindarin cognates in ''-il''; most notably compare the Quenya ''[[amille]]'' "mother" and the Sindarin ''[[emil]]''.
==Examples==
*''[[emil]]'' "mother"<ref>{{VT|45a}} p.5</ref>
*''[[odhril]]'' "parent (referring to mother)"
*''[[melethril]]'' "lover"<ref name="E">{{HM|LR}}, [[The Etymologies]]</ref>
*''[[brennil]]'' "lady"<ref name="E"/>
*''[[hiril]]'' "lady"<ref name="E"/>
*''[[Thuringwethil|Thuringweth'''il''']]'' "secret-shadow '''woman'''"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

In at least one case, ''-il'' is said to be a diminutive ending; compare how the masculine ending ''-on'' can sometimes refer to "great" things.

*''[[niphredil]]'' "little pallor" ([[niphred]])<ref name="E"/>
*''[[ernil]]'' "prince" (perhaps understood as *"little noble"; [[arn]])
