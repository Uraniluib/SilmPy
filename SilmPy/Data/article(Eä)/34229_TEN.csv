'''TEN''' is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "direction".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 187 (root appearing as "√TEN-")</ref>

==Derivatives==

*[[Quenya]]: ''[[tenna]]''<ref name=PE17/>; ''[[ten|tenne]]''<ref name=VT/>

==Other versions==
===TEƷ===
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] appears the root TEƷ- ("line, direction"). From this root derives:<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 391-2 (roots appearing as "TEƷ-" and "TEÑ"</ref>

*[[Primitive Quendian]]: ''teʒē''
**[[Quenya]]: ''[[tië|tie]]''
**[[Noldorin]]: ''tê'' ("line, way")

*[see TEÑ<sup>1</sup>]
**[[Quenya]]: ''téra'' ("straight, right")
**[[Noldorin]]: ''tîr'' ("straight, right")

===TEÑ<sup>1</sup> and TEÑ<sup>2</sup>===
According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the root TEƷ- was changed to TEÑ. In this new entry, Quenya ''téra'' and Noldorin ''tîr'' derived from Primitive Quendian ''teñrā'',<ref name=LR/> where an intermediate form appears to be ''tēra''.<ref name=VT>{{VT|46a}}, pp. 17-18</ref>

There exists furthermore an additional entry on TEÑ in the ''Etymologies'' (for the sake of clarity, here called TEÑ<sup>2</sup>), yielding the derivatives Noldorin ''tî'' ("line, row"), ''tiwdi'' ("alphabet"), ''tær'', ''taer'' ("straight"), and [[Quenya]] ''téma'' ("row, series, line"), ''tea'' ("straight line, road").<ref name=LR/><ref name=VT/>

Note that there also exists a root [[TEÑ]], with a different signification, in the manuscript "[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Eldarin Roots and Stems]]".<ref name=PE17/>

===√''ten''===

The complexity of the root TEN is has been discussed at length by [[Patrick H. Wynne]]. A very late (ca. 1968) manuscript by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] includes an almost identical rendering of √''ten'' as given in the version from "[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Eldarin Roots and Stems]]" (that is, the version used as the first definition in this article), which, however, was changed to a √''men'' (yielding different derivatives). An earlier manuscript (late 1950s or early 1960s) by Tolkien also contains a mention of a √''ten-'', having a similar (but not identical) description.<ref>{{VT|49a}}, pp. 23-24 (roots appearing as "√''ten''" and "√''ten-''")</ref>
