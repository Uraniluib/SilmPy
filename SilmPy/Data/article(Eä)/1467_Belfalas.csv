'''Belfalas''' was a region of southern [[Gondor]], encompassing the coast from the mouth of the [[Anduin]] to [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name=VT/> South of the Belfalas lay a great Bay, which was named after it: the [[Bay of Belfalas]].
==History==
In the late [[First Age]], [[Sindar]] refugees from [[Beleriand]]<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> settled the area and established an Elven settlement about 50 miles north of the later-named [[Dol Amroth]], at [[Edhellond]]<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, note 18</ref> 

A family of [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] had ruled over the land of Belfalas since the [[Second Age]]. This family of [[Númenóreans]] were akin to the [[Lords of Andúnië]], and thus related to [[Elendil]] and descended from the [[House of Elros]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they had been given the title "Prince of Belfalas" by [[Elendil]]<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> and their land, now a fief of [[Gondor]], was called [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas.

Amroth, [[King of Lórien]] from the beginning of the Third Age,<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> left his [[Lothlórien|realm]] behind in {{TA|1981}} in search of his beloved [[Nimrodel]], who had fled from the [[Balrog|horror]] unleashed by the [[Dwarves]] in [[Moria]], along with numerous [[Galadhrim]].  He waited for her at Edhellond, for their final voyage together into the West. But Nimrodel, who loved [[Middle-earth]] as much as she did Amroth, failed to join him.  When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her, and drowned in the bay.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 240-242, 245.</ref> When [[Amroth]] was lost at sea in {{TA|1981}} the last of these Elves left the region.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

It was from the name of this king that Dol Amroth (the "Hill of Amroth") took its name. The first Prince of Dol Amroth was [[Galador]], the son of [[Imrazôr]]. According to legend, Imrazôr had married the Elven-lady [[Mithrellas]], a companion of Nimrodel.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39, p. 316</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], the nearby city of [[Linhir]] was attacked by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and the [[Haradrim]] and Men of [[Lamedon]] under [[Angbor]] tried to keep them off, until the [[Grey Company]] with the [[wraiths]] of the [[Oathbreakers]] arrived and ended the conflict.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Belfalas'' consists of ''[[bel]]'' (a [[Pre-Númenórean]] element of unknown meaning) + [[Sindarin]] ''[[falas]]'' ("shore").<ref name=VT>{{VT|42a}}, p. 15</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Havens of Belfalas were an area in the region of Western [[Gondor]]. They were located south of the [[Blackroot Vale]] via "Tarlang's Crown" and south-west of [[Lamedon]]. The "Emyn Ernil" lay to the east, dividing Belfalas from [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. During March of {{TA|3019}}, the two bridges to the Emyn Ernil were destroyed, preventing direct travel between the two areas through the hills. The capital was [[Dol Amroth]] and other settlements included "Tadrent" and "Ost Lontir". There were two [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacons]] in Belfalas, on the north edges of the Emyn Ernil: "Amon Lontir" and "Nendath". The small island "Tol Aduial" was in the bay north of Dol Amroth and the larger island "Tol Fennas" was west of Dol Amroth. A reclusive group of [[Elves]], the "Avorrim", kept watch upon the abandoned haven of [[Edhellond]] in secret.
