'''Vista''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈvista]}}) or '''Wista''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈwista]}}) was a part of the atmosphere that surrounded the world of [[Arda]] before the cataclysm at the end of the [[Second Age]].

Vista was the lowest layer of the atmosphere, filled with normal breathable air: above it was [[Ilmen]], and above that [[Vaiya]].  Vista was divided into two parts: The upper part was [[Fanyamar]], the home of clouds, and the lower part was [[Aiwenórë]], the "land" of birds.  Vista only lay upon [[Middle-earth]] and the seas; it was bounded by the [[Pelóri|Mountains of Valinor]] in the West, the [[Gates of Morning|Walls of the Sun]] in the East, and the [[Walls of the World]] in the North and South.

The air in [[Valinor]] is that of [[Ilmen]] which can only sustain the servants of [[Manwë]] or those to whom he has granted this ability.  Thus the mortal creatures of Middle-earth were bound within the confines of Vista while they lived.<ref>{{SM|5b}}, pp. 289-290</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the early schematic titled ''[[I Vene Kemen]]'', the lowest layer of airs was marked as ''Vilna'' ([[Qenya]]).
