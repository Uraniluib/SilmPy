__NOTOC__
'''Tavrobel''' or '''Tathrobel''' was a village on [[Tol Eressea]], the home of [[Pengolodh]] when he returned to the West, and where [[Aelfwine]] saw and translated the Annals.<ref name=LRA>{{LR|A3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In the ''[[Etymologies]]'', the name is envisioned as [[Noldorin]] and is reinterpreted to contain the Noldorin words ''tavr'' "woodpecker" and ''[[gobel]]'' "encircled village".<ref name=LRA/><ref name=ety>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries TAM and PEL(ES)</ref><!-- The newer name Tathrobel obviously means "village of willows" (cf. Nan Tathren) but no online citation can be found -->

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tavrobel appears in the earliest phases of the [[Legendarium]] as a town on the western part of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 62</ref> The Tower of Tavrobel was beside the rivers [[Afros]] and [[Gruir]] which joined at the bridge of Tavrobel. Nearby the bridge was the [[Gilfanon]]'s home, the [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]]. Around the land, the [[Gnomes]] lived as one people.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 175</ref><ref>{{LT2|Index}}</ref> It was located a league away from the [[Heath of the Sky-roof]].<ref name=notes/>

In Tolkien's notes, Gilfanon hosted [[Ottor Wǽfre]] ([[Eriol]]) in his House, where he compiled the [[Golden Book]] with the tales he had heard, and then was allowed to drink [[limpe]]. Eriol died in Tavrobel. One of his sons, [[Heorrenda]] afterwards settled Tavrobel, and it became [[Wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]].<ref name=notes>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>

Tavrobel was also considered to be the name of a settlement in [[Brethil]] of the [[Haladin|Woodmen]] and [[Túrin]]. See: [[Amon Obel]].<ref name=LRA/><ref name=ety/>

In the early [[Gnomish Lexicon]], the name is said to mean "wood-home", including the [[Gnomish]] words ''taur'', ''tavros'' "forest" from [[root]] TAVA; and ''pel'' said to mean "village, hamlet, -ham".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref><ref name=LRA/>
==Inspiration==
Tavrobel is identified as Great Haywood, or more specifically Staffordshire village. [[Tolkien]] was stationed in a camp near Great Haywood and [[Edith Tolkien]] lived there after their marriage. Tolkien was again in Great Haywood in the winter of [[1916]]-[[1917|7]], after his return from France.<ref>{{LT1|In}}</ref>

G. L. Elkin, the Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, has further suggested to Christopher Tolkien that Gilfanon's House of Hundred Chimneys may have been based on the [[Wikipedia:Shugborough Hall|Shugborough Hall]] at the Great Haywood, and likewise the bridge of Tavrobel may have been based on the [[Wikipedia:Essex Bridge, Staffordshire|Essex Bridge]] that crosses River Trent 100 metres of its confluence with River Sow. The nearby [[Heath of the Sky-roof]], the site of a battle among [[Men]], was perhaps inspired by Hopton Heath, the site of the [[Wikipedia:Battle of Hopton Heath|Battle of Hopton Heath]].<ref name=LRA/>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that as Great Haywood is near the confluence of [[Wikipedia:River Sow|Sow]] and [[Wikipedia:River Trent|Trent]], the two Tavrobels are also near the confluence of two rivers: Afros / Gruir (Tol Eressea) and [[Taeglin|Taiglin]] / [[Sirion]] (Brethil).<ref name=LRA/>
