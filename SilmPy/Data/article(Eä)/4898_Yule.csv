'''Yule''' was the [[Northern Mannish]] name of the midwinter festival, observed around the [[Westlands]]. The days around Yule were the Yule-tide.

In the [[Shire Calendar]], Yule referred to two days (the last of the previous and the first of the new year). Due to a peculiarity of the Calendar, the 2 Yuledays were "between" and outside the formal months of [[Foreyule]] and [[Afteryule]]. They always fell on the same days of the week: the last day of the year, [[1 Yule]], was always a [[Highday]] (Friday), while the first day of the following year, [[2 Yule]], was always a [[Sterday]] (Saturday).<ref name="Shire">{{App|Shire}}</ref><ref group=note>On a modern calendar, they fell approximately on 21 and 22 December.</ref> 

Around them, the six-day festival of [[Yuledays|Yuletide]] was held, running from [[29 December|29]] [[Foreyule]] through [[2 January|2]] [[Afteryule]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
{{quote|Very best wishes for Yule - J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien to [[Richard Jeffery]]<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>}}
Yule is a translation of a [[Hobbitish]] word, not occurring in [[Westron]].<ref name="Nomen"/>

However it's possible that it derives from a form of [[Northern Mannish]] and later used in [[Rohirric]]. Since [[Gondorians]] of the [[Third Age]] were in part [[Northmen]], the word was recognisable as a 'northern name' for the midwinter festival.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 781</ref>

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "Yule(night), i.e. Log-night" is ''durufui''. ''Tanfui'' means "Yule night".<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 31, 69</ref>
