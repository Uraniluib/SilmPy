'''Eilinel''' was the wife of [[Gorlim|Gorlim the Unhappy]].

==History==
Eilinel was a fair and gentle maiden, and was much loved by Gorlim. When her husband went to the [[Dagor Bragollach]], their house was plundered. Eilinel was killed.

Upon returning home, Gorlim could not find any trace of Eilinel. He kept returning to their house seeking for his lost wife, and [[Sauron]] tricked him by devising a [[phantoms|phantom]] of Eilinel to make him betray the location of [[Barahir]].<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref>
