'''Sador''' was a carpenter and servant of the [[Húrin]], and the childhood friend of Húrin's son [[Túrin]].

==Description==
Sador was a "house-man in the service of Húrin" who had been a woodman and somehow had accidentally severed his right foot off. The remaining part of his leg had shrunken from lack of use. One of Sador's talents was wood-working. (UT 78) In spite of being a simple servant, Sador was wise and shared with young Túrin many insights about the nature of Men, Orcs and fate.

==History==
Sador worked in the outbuildings, fixing things around the house which were usually of little importance. He was Túrin's best friend during his youth, and the boy would often help Sador by fetching materials and tools to spare him from walking. When Túrin brought him gifts he "found" lying around, Sador would tell the boy to return them, and taught him he shouldn't steal even if it is to give. (UT, 79) Sador enjoyed Túrin's company and would often carve for him figures of men and beasts, although Túrin enjoyed Sador's stories the most.

Sador, before becoming disabled, fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. He came too late to the battle field however, and was only able to bring back the fallen [[Hador]]. He was then stationed at [[Eithel Sirion]]. He was there when Húrin took command. (UT, 79)

On Túrin's birthday, his father gave him an [[Elves|Elven]] knife of great worth. Túrin pitied Sador and decided to give the gift to him. Sador accepted the gift as it would be rude not to, but he knew he would be unable to repay Túrin for such a gift. (UT, 84)

Túrin's mother, [[Morwen]], did not care for Sador and called him "self-maimed by his own want of skill, and he is slow with his tasks, for he spends much time on trifles unbidden." (UT, 85) With this knife Sador set to carve a great throne for the hall of Húrin.

After Túrin departed, Sador remained in the house of [[Morwen]], though he wished he may have joined the battle to die a valiant death. Upon Túrin's return from [[Nargothrond]], Sador joined in the rebellion against the [[Easterlings]] who had taken over the land. He was then wounded and perished.

==Etymology==
''sador'' is a [[Sindarin]] word which translates to "steadfast, trusty, loyal".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 183</ref>

==Names==
Sador had several names including:
* [[Labadal]] - Translates to "hopafoot", given to Sador by Túrin
* [[Onefoot]] - A title for Sador referring to his lack of a right foot (UT, p. 136)
* [[Sadog]] - Early version of Sador written by Tolkien, possibly just a typo.
