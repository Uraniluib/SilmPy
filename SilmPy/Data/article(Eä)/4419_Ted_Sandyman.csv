'''Ted Sandyman''' was the miller of [[Hobbiton]].

==History==
Ted was a miller after [[Sandyman|his father]]. [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] did not like him, and even less when he found out Ted collaborated with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and [[Saruman|Sharkey]], in exchange for a new and much improved mill.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
It is possible [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by the miller's son at [[Sarehole]] mill, Warwickshire, England.

{{quote|There were two millers [at Sarehole Mill], father and son. The old man had a black beard, but it was the son who frightened the boys with his white dusty clothes and sharp-eyed face. Ronald named him 'the White Ogre'. When he yelled at them to clear off they would scamper away from the yard...|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

{{quote|I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{FR|Foreword}}</ref>}}
