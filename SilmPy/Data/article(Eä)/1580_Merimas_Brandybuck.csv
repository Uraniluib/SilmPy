'''Merimas Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Buckland]].

==History==
Merimas was the eldest child, and only son, of [[Marmadas Brandybuck]]. He was present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Birthday Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Merimas'' is, like most male Brandybuck names, Celtic in sound, but apparently meaningless. The first element, ''Meri'', is similar to ''[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]'', and could, like in that name, have been based on Buckland Westron ''kali'', "jolly, gay".<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>
