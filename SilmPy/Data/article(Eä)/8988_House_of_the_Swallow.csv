The '''House of the Swallow''' was one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim]], mentioned in the [[Fall of Gondolin]] as being under [[Duilin of Gondolin|Duilin]].  It was a house of archers, who wore a fan of feathers upon their helms, and they were arrayed in white and dark blue and in purple and black.  Their emblem, which rested upon their shields, was that of an arrowhead.  During the Fall they stood upon the walls of the [[Gondolin]], and many were thrust to doom when the enemy came from behind after passing through the [[North Gate of Gondolin|North Gate]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
