They were accompanied to the Grey Havens by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] and many other Elves besides, but whether any of these others went aboard the ship with them is not told.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> It does seem, though, that Gandalf's horse [[Shadowfax]] did make the journey for he was waiting at the quayside<ref>{{L|268}}</ref>. The White Ship was one of the last ships to have set sail from the Grey Havens.
