'''Eldamar''' was the land of the [[Elves]] in [[Aman]], which encompassed the [[Calacirian]], the coastal area east of the [[Pelóri]], and [[Tol Eressëa]].  The main settlements of the Elves in this region were [[Tirion]], [[Alqualondë]], and [[Avallónë]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Eldamar.mp3|Ardamir}}''Eldamar'' means "'''[[Elvenhome]]'''" in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 20</ref> composed of ''[[eldar|elda]]'' ("[[High-elves|High-elf]]") and ''[[már]]'' ("home").

==Other versions of the legendarium==
An early name for the region was ''[[Eglamar (disambiguation)|Eglamar]]'', having the same meaning as ''Eldamar'' (''Egla'' being the [[Gnomish]] form of the later ''[[Eldar|Elda]]'').<ref name=WJBeleriand>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 189</ref>

==Inspiration==
The name is a direct translation of the mythological [[Wikipedia:Álfheimr|Elfhame]] (lit. "Elf-home") meaning "Elfland, [[Faery]]".
