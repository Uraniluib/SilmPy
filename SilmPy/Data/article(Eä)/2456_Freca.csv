'''Freca''' (d. {{TA|2754}}), who claimed descent from King [[Fréawine]], was a lord of [[Rohan]] during the reign of King [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]].  His lands lay on either side of the [[Adorn]] west of the [[Gap of Rohan]] and he was said to have much [[Dunlendish]] blood in his veins (and, unusual for one of the [[Rohirrim]], grew dark hair).  Obtaining wealth and power from his rich domain, he constructed a stronghold at the source of the Adorn and paid little heed to the king although Helm called upon him to attend his councils.

In {{TA|2754}} Freca came to a council with a retinue of many men and requested that Helm's daughter be wed to his son [[Wulf]].  Helm rebuffed him and called him fat, Freca raged and reviled the king, and after the council Helm struck Freca so powerfully that Freca died from the blow.  Helm then declared Wulf and all of Freca's near kin to be his enemies and the retinue fled to the west.

Rohan was invaded from the east in {{TA|2758}}.  Sensing their chance, a host of Dunlendings invaded from [[Isengard]] and from over the [[Isen]].  Their leader was Wulf, who drove Helm into the [[Hornburg]], captured [[Edoras]] and sat in [[Meduseld]], and called himself king.  Although Helm and his sons died in the [[Long Winter]], his sister-son [[Fréaláf]] surprised and slew Wulf and regained Edoras.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

The slaying of Freca was not forgotten by his people and in the [[War of the Ring]], over two hundred and fifty years later, many of them sided with [[Saruman]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, note 4</ref>
