'''''harma''''' is a noun meaning "treasure" in [[Quenya]].<ref name="Names">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref>

 [[Image:Harma.gif|left]]''Harma'' (the ''h'' was pronounced as ''ch'') was also the name in Quenya of the eleventh letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.<ref name="Names"/>  It is the third letter of the third grade or [[Tyellë]], which contains "voiceless spirants" and it is the third letter in the third series of consonants.

*For written Quenya, the third series is used for the ''k''-series, the ''[[Calmatéma]]''.<ref name="Letters">{{App|Letters}}</ref>  Originally ''Harma'' represented spirant '''CH''' in all positions.  Over time the initial sound softened into breath '''H''' at the beginning of words (a sound for which Quenya originally used a letter called ''[[Halla]]''); the letter ''Harma'' was then used only in medial positions, where the original '''CH''' sound was retained, and to reflect this, it was renamed ''[[Aha]]''.<ref>{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters'', footnote 1</ref>  
*In [[Sindarin]] this letter represents '''CH'''.
*In [[Westron]], the third series is used for a variety of consonantal sounds and this letter represents '''SH'''.<ref name="Letters"/>  The Westron name for this letter is '''''Shé'''''.<ref>See [[Westron Tengwar]]</ref>
