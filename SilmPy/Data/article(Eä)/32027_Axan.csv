__NOTOC__
'''''axan''''' (pl. '''''axani''''') is a [[Quenya]] noun meaning "law, rule, commandment, primarily proceeding from [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]".<ref name=Os>{{VT|39b}}, pp. 23 and 30-31</ref> The term refers to laws established by Ilúvatar that lesser beings are directed to follow but can choose to disobey. The ''axani'' contrast with the ''[[únat]]i'', which are physical laws that are impossible to break. [[Melkor]] refused to accept any ''axani'' as binding upon him, but much to his frustration, he was unable to violate the ''únati''.<ref name=Os />

==Etymology==
It is said to derive from [[Valarin]] ''[[akašân]]'', meaning "He says", with "He" referring to Eru.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref><ref name=Os />

==Inspiration==
''axan'' is similar to the ancient Greek word ''[[Wikipedia:Anax (Greek)|ἄναξ]]'' (''wanakts, anax'') meaning "ruler, lord, king".<!--Is this our fancy or a genuine connection?--> The Valarin form ''akašân'', in the meantime, resembles the word [[Wikipedia:akasha|akasha]], the aether in Hindu cosmology and mysticism.<ref>See Wikipedia links</ref>
