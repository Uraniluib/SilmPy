}}'''Tar-Ancalimë''' was the seventh ruler and first [[Ruling Queen of Númenor]], her reign spreading over 205 years, longest after that of [[Elros|Elros Tar-Minyatur]].<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Ancalimë</ref>

==History==

When Ancalimë was four years old her father Aldarion left his family to return to the sea.  When he did, his wife Erendis took Ancalimë from [[Armenelos]] to be raised in the pastures of [[Emerië]].  Ancalimë's only childhood companion was [[Zamîn]] and she saw few men.  Her mother sought to feed her daughter with her own bitterness towards men.

She withdrew to the countryside of [[Emerië]], rejecting all of the many suitors who sought her royal hand. While she was dwelling in the sheep-lands of [[Númenor]] she acquired the title '''Emerwen Aranel''', which is [[Quenya]] for "Princess Shepherdess". 

Though she rejected her courting nobles, she grew close to a shepherd by the name of [[Mámandil]], but after a while Ancalimë was angered to discover that Mámandil was no shepherd, but another noble suitor, [[Hallacar]] son of [[Hallatan]] of [[Hyarastorni]].<ref name=wife>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Both Tar-Ancalimë and [[Hallacar]] were fifth-generation descendants of [[Vardamir|Tar-Vardamir]], and the marriage was more one of politics than of love. The Queen aimed to produce of an heir in order to secure her throne from her first cousin [[Soronto]]. 

Following the birth of their son, [[Hallacar]] and Tar-Ancalimë lived apart.  Following the death of her father Tar-Ancalimë neglected his policies and gave no further aid to [[Gil-galad]].<ref name="Kings"/>

The Queen had forbidden her serving-women to marry, but Hallacar had arranged otherwise.<ref name=wife/>

She was succeeded by her son, [[Tar-Anárion]]. She died in {{SA|1285}}, at the age of 412 years.<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Ancalimë'' (pron. {{IPA|[aŋˈkalime]}}) is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "Radiance" or "Most bright".{{fact}} See also ''[[Tar|Tar-]]''.
