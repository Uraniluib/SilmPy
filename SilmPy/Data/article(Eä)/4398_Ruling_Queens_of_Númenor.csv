The '''Ruling Queens of Númenor''' were women who ruled the kingdom of [[Númenor]]. 

==History==
In the early days of Númenor, succession followed the principle of agnatic primogeniture&mdash;that is, rule passed to the oldest ''male'' offspring of the King. The [[Queen of Númenor]] was the queen consort of the King.

[[Tar-Aldarion]], the sixth ruler of Númenor, had only one child: a daughter, [[Ancalimë]]. To prevent the throne from passing to his nephew, [[Soronto]], he changed the '''[[Law of Succession in Númenor]]''' to allow full cognatic primogeniture, under which rule would pass to the oldest child of the ruler, whether male or female. 

Out of Númenor's twenty-five [[King of Númenor|rulers]], only three were female: '''[[Tar-Ancalimë]]''', '''[[Tar-Telperiën]]''' and '''[[Tar-Vanimeldë]]'''. [[Tar-Míriel]] should have been the fourth Ruling Queen, but the throne was usurped from her by her cousin [[Ar-Pharazôn]].
