The '''Dwarves of the Iron Hills''' were [[Dwarves]] belonging to the house of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]], otherwise known as [[Durin's Folk]], who lived in the [[Iron Hills]]. They became well-known for making a metal mesh that could be used for making flexible items like leg-coverings.

==History==
===Early history===
The [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] colonized the Iron Hills in the [[First Age]]. The Hills were their primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=Relations>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 302</ref> The [[Old Forest Road|Dwarf-road of Mirkwood]] ran north-east from Khazad-dûm to the Hills for use by dwarf-traders and merchants.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, p. 323 (note 30)</ref>

After [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]] in the [[Second Age]], the Longbeards sealed Khazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the Grey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and Khazad-dûm for some time.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref>

=== Third Age===
====Founding of Grór's Realm====
In the Third Age, many Longboard Dwarves lived in the [[Grey Mountains]], but they were greatly troubled by [[Dragons]] in that region. After King [[Dáin I]] was slain by one of these dragons, his surviving sons led an exodus into the east. Dáin's elder son [[Thrór]] recreated the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], while his younger brother [[Grór]] led a part of the people further into the east to join their kindred living in the [[Iron Hills]].

Grór settled in the Iron Hills in the year {{TA|2590}} and became [[Lord of the Iron Hills]]. During his reign, the realm became the strongest in the North, being the only realm standing between Sauron and his plans to destroy Rivendell and taking back the lands of Angmar.{{fact}} Also, following the [[Sack of Erebor]] many of Durin's folk fleeing from [[Smaug]] and those wandering in exile, except for [[Thrór]] and his small company of family and followers, came to the Iron Hills, bolstering their numbers.

====War of the Dwarves and Orcs====
During the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], many Dwarves from the Iron Hills fought several battles, but they are mostly remembered from the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in the year {{TA|2799}}. [[Náin son of Grór|Naín]] and his army came to the battle in the most crucial moment, when the main Dwarven army was being decimated by the great host of Orcs. With these fresh reinforcments,  the Dwarves were able to route and destroy their opponents, fighting their way all up to the steps of the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] of [[Moria]]. There, Nain dueled with [[Azog]], the [[Orcs|Orc]] commander, resulting to his death. Later in the battle,[[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] killed Azog out of vengeance for his father, achieving recognition because he was very young for dwarven standards. After this battle Dain led his Dwarves back to Grór's Halls.

====Dáin's Reign====
Grór ruled the Dwarves of the Iron Hills for 215 years, and he died in {{TA|2805}} at 241 years of age. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] became the next Lord of the Iron Hills. During his reign, the Iron Hills evolved to the mightiest Dwarf-realm of its time.{{fact}}

Years later, Dáin's cousin [[Thorin]] attempted to restore the kingdom at Erebor, but he was trapped by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] and [[Northmen]] of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] and sent to the Iron Hills for aid. Dáin arrived with 500 armoured Dwarves and as events developed, the Dwarves of the Iron Hills proved crucial in winning the ensuing [[Battle of Five Armies]] against the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]]. Thorin died in that battle, and with him the royal line of [[Thrór]]. Through his ancestor Grór, the Kingship of Durin's Folk then fell on Dáin. Dáin II Ironfoot removed from the Iron Hills, and re-established a kingdom under the [[Lonely Mountain]]. It is possible that both Iron Hills and [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] were ruled by him and later by his son [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]].

It is unknown whether the Dwarves of the Iron Hills fought alongside the Dwarves of Erebor in the [[Battle of Dale]] against the [[Easterlings]] during the [[War of the Ring]].
