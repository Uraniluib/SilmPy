{{disambig-more|Aulendil|[[Aulendil (disambiguation)]]}}
In the early [[Second Age]], [[Sauron]] came to the [[Noldor]] in disguise, taking various different aliases in his efforts to seduce them. The best known of these was probably [[Annatar]], the "Lord of Gifts", but it seems that he took at least two other names as well. One of these was '''Aulendil''', meaning approximately "Devotee of [[Aulë]]".<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, note 7</ref> Aulë was the [[Valar|Vala]] with special knowledge of making and invention, and was held in particular reverence by the [[Noldor]] — hence, presumably, Sauron's choice of the name. There was a special irony in the choice, too, because in the far distant past, Sauron actually had belonged to the people of Aulë, until he was corrupted into the service of [[Morgoth|Melkor]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}, Of the Enemies</ref>
