<center>{{quote|Yea, 'tis an unhappy tale, for sorrow hath fared ever abroad among [[Men]] and doth so still, but in the wild days were very terrible things done and suffered; and yet hath [[Melko]] seldom devised more cruelty, nor do I know a tale that is more pitiful.|'''Eltas''', ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', [[Turambar and the Foalókë]]}}</center>

'''Eltas''' was a [[man]] whose people lived in a vale of [[Hisilómë]] and that he had come to [[Tol Eressëa]] by [[Olórë Mallë]] "in the days before the fall of [[Gondolin]]". The tale of Turambar he had heard from the older men of his people who hated [[Melko]] and his "evil worms".<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 70, cf. p. 118.</ref>

He was in the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] on the second day of the feast of [[Turuhalmë]]; in the absence of [[Gilfanon|Ailios]], Eltas told the tale of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'' to [[Eriol]].<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 69-70</ref>

After the tale of Turambar Eltas was asked to tell the story of [[the Nauglafring]], but he said that the tales of [[Tuor]] and [[Beren]] should be told first.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 144.</ref> However, he didn't tell the story of the Nauglafring, and he doesn't appear any more.
