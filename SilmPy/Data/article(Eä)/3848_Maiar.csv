The '''Maiar''' (singular '''Maia'''; [[Quenya]], pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmaɪ.ar]}}) were those spirits which descended to [[Arda]] to help the [[Valar]] shape the World. They were numerous, yet not many were named, and few also took visible shapes in Middle-Earth. The Maiar were [[Ainur]] &mdash; technically, any Ainu that is not counted as a Vala is a Maia.

==History==
Their chiefs were [[Eönwë]], banner-bearer and herald of [[Manwë]], and [[Ilmarë]], the handmaid of [[Varda]].

Each of the Maiar was associated with one or more particular Vala, and were of similar stock, though less powerful. For example, [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]], as spirits of the sea, belonged to [[Ulmo]], while [[Curumo]], who came to be known in [[Middle-earth]] as [[Saruman]], belonged to [[Aulë]] the Smith.

Others included [[Mairon]], also originally of Aulë's people, who later became known as [[Sauron]]; [[Aiwendil]], who was known in Middle-earth as [[Radagast]] the Brown and belonged to the people of [[Yavanna]]; and [[Olórin]], known as [[Gandalf]], who belonged to [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].The latter's ways took him often to the house of [[Nienna]] from  whom he learned pity and patience, which perhaps aided him in his later struggles to unite the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against the power of Sauron.

The [[Blue Wizards]] travelled to the east, and never returned to the west. Their fate is unknown. The [[Balrogs]], like Sauron, were Maiar corrupted by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. Their associated Vala is not known. [[Melian]] served both [[Vána]] and [[Estë]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest forms of the Legendarium, such as ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', many beings are said to be among the lesser Ainur, including [[dryads]] and [[mermaids]]. The concept of the Maiar was introduced in the reworking of the [[Annals of Valinor]] into the [[Annals of Aman]], and superceded most references to such beings.<ref name="MRP2b">{{MR|P2b}}</ref>
