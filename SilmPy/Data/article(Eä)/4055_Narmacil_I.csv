}}'''Narmacil I''' {{TA|1049}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1294|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 245 years) was the seventeenth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Narmacil inherited the Kingship from his father [[Atanatar II|Atanatar II Alcarin]] in {{TA|1226}}.<ref name="South"/>  He also seems to have inherited his father's indolent disposition for in {{TA|1240|n}} he declared [[Minalcar]], the son of his younger brother [[Calmacil (King of Gondor)|Calmacil]], to be the [[Regent of Gondor|Regent of the realm]].  During the remainder of Narmacil's reign Minalcar ruled in his name.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

The Easterlings renewed their attacks with a small force, but Minalcar proved to be a vigorous Regent. While Narmacil stayed behind, Minalcar sallied forth in {{TA|1248}} and defeated a large army between [[Rhovanion]] and the [[Sea of Rhûn]].  He then took the name of "Rómendacil" (and later would ascend the throne as Rómendacil II). Because he had learned that the [[Northmen]] were not always loyal to [[Gondor]], [[Third Age 1250|soon after]] this victory, Rómendacil sent his son as an ambassador to secure their allegiance.<ref name="Gondor"/>

Narmacil ultimately became second childless King of [[Gondor]] and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Calmacil (King of Gondor)|Calmacil]].<ref name="South"/>
