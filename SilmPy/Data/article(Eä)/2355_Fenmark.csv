'''Fenmarch''' was a region of eastern [[Rohan]] that stretched from the [[Firienholt|Firien Wood]] along the [[Mering Stream]], and therefore marked part of [[Rohan]]'s eastern border with [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The fen element of the name means "marsh" and is a reference to the wetlands along the [[Mering Stream]]. ''March'' is an old word for "borderland" - a reference to the border with [[An√≥rien]] - and has the same derivation as [[Riddermark|Mark]], a name for the whole country of Rohan.<ref name="Nomen"/>

Note that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] writes that on reflection he would have preferred the form "Fenmark", to the extent that he recommended this alternative version for translated versions of the book.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 770</ref>
