{{disambig-more|Ringil|[[Ringil (disambiguation)]]}}
In an early conception of the [[legendarium]], '''Ringil''' was one of the two towers that held one of the [[Two Lamps]] created to light [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Ringil was a great tower, raised by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] to house the ''southern'' of the [[Two Lamps]] fashioned by [[Aulë]] to illuminate [[Middle-earth]]. The tower was extremely tall, rising to the stars, and shone like pale blue crystal. Melkor claimed that Ringil and its northern twin [[Helkar]] were made of a strong, imperishable substance that he had devised; in reality he lied for they were made of ice (a material unknown to the other [[Valar]]).  When Aulë's lamps were placed upon them (silver in the north and gold in the south) the ice melted and caused great floods to pour into the seas.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 69-70</ref>
