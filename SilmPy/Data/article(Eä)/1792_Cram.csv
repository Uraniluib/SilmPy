'''Cram''' was a biscuit-like substance made by the [[Men]] of [[Lake-town]] and [[Dale]], and shared by them with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. It was said to be nutritious, and was used as sustenance on long journeys, as for example by [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the Dwarves on the last stage of their quest.<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref> When [[Gimli]] tasted [[lembas]], he remembered cram.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

It was made from tightly pressed flour or meal. Basic cram like this was a flavourless, uninspiring food, but sometimes milk or honey would be added to make it a little more palatable. 

==Etymology==
In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', ''cram'' is said to be a [[Noldorin]] word (the precursor of [[Sindarin]]), from a root (KRAB-) meaning "press".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''KRAB-'''</ref> It was an "added entry"; [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote much of ''The Etymologies'' before ''[[The Hobbit]]'' came out. It is unclear whether this was any more than fancy at the time, as several of these "added entries" were later reenvisioned with a non-Eldarin origin.
