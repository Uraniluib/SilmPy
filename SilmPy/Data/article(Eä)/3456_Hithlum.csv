{{Pronounce|Hithlum.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Hithlum''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈhiθlum]}}) was a region north of [[Beleriand]] near the [[Helcaraxë]].

==Description==
Hithlum was separated from Beleriand proper by the [[Ered Wethrin]] mountain chain, and was named after the sea mists which formed there at times.<ref name="Bel">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>  The Ered Wethrin ("Mountains of Shadow") formed the southern and eastern wall, and had only a few passes; as such they formed a natural defensive line. The western wall was formed by the [[Ered Lómin]] or "Echoing Mountains", which curved north-westward to [[Helcaraxë]].  The land of [[Lammoth]] lay west of the Ered Wethrin and was not part of Beleriand or Hithlum, and the land of [[Nevrast]] was separated from Hithlum by the southern part of the Ered Lómin.<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref>  Hithlum was cold and rainy, but quite fertile.<ref name="Bel"/>

Hithlum was subdivided in [[Mithrim]], where the High Kings of the [[Noldor]] had their halls,<ref name="Bel"/> and [[Dor-lómin]], which later became a fief of the [[House of Hador]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

==History==
Hithlum was populated by the [[Elves of Mithrim]] who were [[Sindar]]. 
The Ñoldor entered Hithlum via the [[Firth of Drengist]] and first camped at the shores of [[Lake Mithrim]]. The land was covered by mists and vapours from the [[Thangorodrim]], and thus they named it '''Hísilómë''' or '''Land of Mist'''.<ref name="Bel"/> [[Thingol]] gave leave to the Noldor to settle it and was ruled by [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]] from its northern lands.<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref> 

Later in the [[First Age]], Hithlum was [[assaults on Hithlum|continually under attack]] by [[Morgoth]], but its natural defenses, fortified by fortresses such as [[Barad Eithel]], proved impassable.<ref name="Map"/> Almost a century after the [[Dagor Aglareb]], a small number of [[Orcs]] came from the [[Firth of Drengist]] from the west, but once they were spotted, Fingon pushed them back into the sea.<ref name=return/>

During the following peaceful years, Fingolfin welcomed to his service the folk of the House of Hador to whom he gave some lands.<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> The mountains protected Hithlum during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], after which [[Edain]] of the [[First House]] came from [[Dorthonion]] as refugees and joined those of Hador.<ref name=ruin/> 

Seven years after the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth sent a great force against Hithlum, attacking the passes of the Ered Wethrin. [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] died defending the [[Eithel Sirion]]; in a second attempt the [[Falathrim]] sailed up the Firth of Drengist, then assisted Fingon by striking the unsuspecting orcs from the west.<ref name=ruin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Hithlum eventually was lost after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. The Hadorians were scattered, killed, or enslaved, the Noldor who could not flee in time were enslaved in Morgoth's mines. Morgoth gave the [[Swarthy Men]] the lands of Hithlum as a reward, but actually they were trapped there.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Hithlum was completely destroyed during the [[War of Wrath]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Hithlum'' is a [[North Sindarin]] word,<ref name=PE17/> meaning "Mist-shadow" (''[[hith]]'' + ''[[lum]]''), a translation from [[Quenya]] '''''Hísilómë''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌhisiˈloːme]}}, stem ''Hisilómi-'').<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Hísilómë''</ref> Its classical [[Sindarin]] name is said to be '''''Hithlũ'''''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}} p. 133</ref>  In the days of [[Túrin]] the region was called ''Aryador'' in the language of [[Men]].<ref>{{LB|1b}}</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] initially marked the word as [[Noldorin]]; its second element was cognate to Quenya ''[[lumbe]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry LUM- p. 370</ref>
