==Etymology==
'''Meldis''' is the [[Sindarin]] name of [[Zimrahin]], wife of [[Malach|Malach Aradan]]. The meaning of the name is "friend"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, s. v. MEL-, 372</ref>. The name only occurs in the genealogical table of the 'folk of [[Marach]]'<ref name="WJwest"/>.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In ''The 'Folk of Marach''' family tree (in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'') Zimrhin (and Malach) had a third child.  Originally (in version one of the table) there was a note for multiple children that said, "Others not concerned in these Chronicles".  In version two of the table this became one name, "Sael..th" that was changed to "Saelon" and then the name and birth-date were struck out.<ref name="WJwest"/>
