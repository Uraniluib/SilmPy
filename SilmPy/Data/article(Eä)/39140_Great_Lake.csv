The '''Great Lake''' lay in the center of [[Middle-earth]] when all the lands and seas were symmetrical. In the middle of the lake was the Isle of [[Almaren]], the first dwelling of the [[Valar]] in [[Arda]].

==History==
After the expulsion of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] from Arda in the [[Valian Years|Valian year]] 1,500,<ref name="Annal">{{MR|P2a}}</ref> the [[Valar]] brought order to the seas and lands and it may have been at this time that the Great Lake was formed.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>

In the Valian year 3,450 Melkor came forth in war and cast down the [[Two Lamps]]. Their destruction broke the lands and roiled the seas. The dwelling of the Valar upon Almaren was utterly destroyed and the island and the Great Lake disappeared in the tumult.<ref name="Annal"/>
