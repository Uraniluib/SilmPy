The '''King of Khazad-dûm''' ([[Sindarin]]: '''''[[Aran]] Moria''''') was typically the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] who also ruled [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], the greatest [[Dwarves|dwarf]] kingdom of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] clan. 

Founded in the [[Years of the Trees]] by [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]], the kingdom lasted for thousands of years before its people were driven into exile by a [[Balrog]] in {{TA|1980}}. The defeat of [[Durin's Bane]] and [[Sauron]] in the [[War of the Ring]] might have allowed [[Durin VII]] to reclaim their ancestral home sometime in the [[Fourth Age]].

==List of known Kings==
While sixty or more kings might have ruled Khazad-dûm through the ages, only nine have been recorded:

* [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] - the founder and first King of Khazad-dûm in the [[First Age]].
* [[Durin II]] - during whose time the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm traded with [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]].
* [[Durin III]] - who was a friend of the [[Elves]] of [[Ost-in-Edhil]] and was given the first of the [[Seven Rings]] by [[Celebrimbor]]. He later sealed the [[Doors of Durin]] when [[Sauron]] destroyed Ost-in-Edhil in {{SA|1697}}.
* [[Durin IV]] (presumably)
* [[Durin V]] (presumably)
* [[Durin VI]] - the king whose Dwarves delved to deep into the earth in their search for ''[[mithril]]'' and awoke a [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]]. He was killed shortly after its release in {{TA|1980}}.
* [[Náin I]] - who was king for less than a year before he too was killed by the Balrog. Durin's folk then fled their ancestral home and Khazad-dûm became known as [[Moria]], the "Black Pit".
*([[Balin]] led a [[Balin's Colony|colony]] that attempted to retake Moria in {{TA|2989}}. Balin was a descendent of Durin, but not of the senior male line of descent, while the King of Durin's Folk was [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. As such, Balin ruled only as '''[[Lord of Moria]]''' and only for five years.)
* [[Durin VII]] - said to have returned to [[Moria]] and refounded Khazad-dûm in the [[Fourth Age]].
