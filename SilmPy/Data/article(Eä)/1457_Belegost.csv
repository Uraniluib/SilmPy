'''Belegost''' was one of two great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Dwarf realms|cities]] in the [[Ered Luin]].

==Description==

Belegost lay in the north central part of the Ered Luin, north of [[Nogrod]] and northeast of [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]],<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> guarding one of the only passes through the mountain range.<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("But the Dwarves had built some great Mansions in those mountains [the Ered Luin] (commanding the only passes)")</ref>

==History==

Belegost was home to the [[Dwarves of Belegost]]. During the mid [[First Age]] its king until [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] was [[Azaghâl]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Belegost was probably founded sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]].<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("...which had certainly been founded long ago ... before the coming of the exiled Noldor, probably before the Eldar of the Great Journey ever reached Beleriand")</ref>

At the end of the First Age, Belegost was ruined in the [[War of Wrath]],<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> and around the [[Second Age 40|fortieth year]] of the [[Second Age]] the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began to migrate to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], abandoning Nogrod and Belegost.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

Additionally, one of Tolkien's earlier maps, as shown by Christopher Tolkien in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'' (and also echoed in [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth|Atlas of Middle-earth]]'') still shows Belegost in the Ered Luin in the time of the [[Third Age]], indicating that Belegost has survived the upheavals of the Second and early Third Ages, or that at least a more recognizable mansion had persisted therein than at Nogrod.

==Etymology==
''Belegost'' ([[beleg]] + [[ost]]) was a [[Sindarin]] translation of the original [[Dwarvish]] name '''''Gabilgathol''''' and both mean "Great City".  Unlike other names of the ''Silmarillion'', the text also gives us an English rendering, which was possibly from [[Westron]]: '''''Mickleburg'''''.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> ''Mickle'' is a root meaning "big"; see also [[Michel Delving]].

The city's [[Khuzdul]] name '''''Gabilgathol''''' contains the elements ''[[gabil]]'' "great" and ''[[gathol]]'' "fortress".

'''''Túrosto''''' was the name in [[Quenya]] for Belegost.<ref>{{WJ|AB}}, p. 389</ref>

==In adaptations==
In ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' the fortress is incorrectly called '''Gabilgathod'''.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', Beleriand and the Lands to the North, Map</ref>
