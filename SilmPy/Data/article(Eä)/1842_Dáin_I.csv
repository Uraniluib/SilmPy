'''Dáin I''' ({{TA|2440}} - {{TA|2589|n}}, aged 149 years) was King of [[Durin's folk]] for 4 years, from {{TA|2585}} to {{TA|2589|n}}.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
Dáin was the son of King [[Náin II]], and he had a younger brother [[Borin]].  He had three children, [[Thrór]], [[Frór]], and [[Grór]].

Dáin flourished during the period when the [[House of Durin]] was seated in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He succeeded his father when the [[Dragons]] of the north had declared [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war against]] the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]]. Dáin ruled his people, who were troubled by increasing attacks from his [[Dáin's halls|halls]] until his rule came to a premature end when both he and his second son, Frór, were killed by a [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]] at his gates. 

After his death, his sons Thrór and Grór led most of the [[Dwarves]] of Durin's folk south. Thrór led [[Dwarves of Erebor|one group]] back to [[Lonely Mountain]], while Grór founded [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|his own realm]] in the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin"/>
