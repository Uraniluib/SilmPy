The '''House of the Fountain''' was one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim]], whose Lord was [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]]. They were said to find delight in silver and diamonds, and their swords were long and bright and pale.  The People of the Fountain of the South, as they were also called, went into battle accompanied by the sweet music of their flutes. 

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], which took place in {{FA|510}}, they were held in reserve by [[Turgon]], who unleashed them after the [[Balrogs]] made a breach in the wall. They made their entrance from the South part of the city and slew a great number of foes. As Balrogs and [[Dragons]] led an army who outnumbered them, the People of the Fountain began retreat towards the [[Square of the King]]. Most likely, the House of the Fountain soon dissolved after the death of Ecthelion at the [[Fountain of the King]], since there is no mention of it afterwards.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
