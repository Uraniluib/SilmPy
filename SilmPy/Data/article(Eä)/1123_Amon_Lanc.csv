'''Amon Lanc''', the Naked Hill, was a hill in the southern parts of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. It had once been the capital of the [[Woodland Realm]] of the [[Silvan Elves]] under [[Oropher]] in the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

Around a millennium after his [[Siege of Barad-dûr|defeat]], [[Sauron]] came to Amon Lanc and reoccupied Oropher's abandoned stronghold. The hill and fortress were then together called [[Dol Guldur]], and the wood in which it stood became known as [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=UT>{{UT|7}}</ref>

In the [[Fourth Age]], southern Mirkwood became known as [[East Lórien]]<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and Amon Lanc obviously became part of it.
