==Etymology==
''Lambengolmor'' is a [[Quenya]] word, glossed as "Loremasters of Tongues" in one manuscript.<ref name=WJ/> In another manuscript, the alternative spelling ''Lambeñgolmor'' is seen, and also glossed as "lingustic loremasters".<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 6</ref> [[Helge Fauskanger]] has noted that only the plural form is attested, of a possible singular form ''Lambengolmo''. The word consists of ''[[lambe]]'' ("tongue, language") + ''ingolmo'' ("loremaster").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=25 June 2011}}</ref>
