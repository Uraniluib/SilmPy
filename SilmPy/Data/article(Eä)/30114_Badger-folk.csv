'''Badger-folk''' were creatures of legend, mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse.<ref name=AB>{{AB|1}}</ref> Nothing is known of their origin or history.
==Characteristics==
According to the poem, the Badger-folk lived in secret houses connected by tunnels under a hill in, or nearby, the [[Old Forest]]. They appear to have been sentient and capable of speaking. Although [[Badger-brock]] once forcefully brought down [[Tom Bombadil]] to their burrows, the Badger-folk do not appear as truly evil creatures, but perhaps rather cunning or tricky.<ref name=AB/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Only mentioned briefly, the Badger-folk of the [[Withywindle]] appear badgerish but live after the manner of [[Hobbits]]. They are one of the [[Fairies|Creatures of Faerië]]<!-- Note by User:Morgan: Faerië[sic]; MERP uses this spelling, while Tolkien rather used "Faërie" -->.<ref>{{ICE|2023}}, p. 63</ref>
