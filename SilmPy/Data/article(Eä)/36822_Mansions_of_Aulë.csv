__NOTOC__
The '''mansions of Aulë''',<ref name=S1/> also called the '''halls of Aulë''',<ref name=S5/> was the dwelling of [[Aulë]] in the midst of [[Valinor]], land of the [[Valar]]. In these mansions Aulë laboured long while making "''many beautiful and shapely works both openly and in secret''", creating both the tools and the lore of the craftsmen.<ref name=S1>{{S|1}}</ref>

It is told that [[Fëanor]] and [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]] often visited the halls of Aulë.<ref name=S5>{{S|5}}</ref>

==Other versions==

In early versions of the [[legendarium]], Aulë's house, situated in the outskirts of [[Valmar]] near its bordering open vale, is said to have consisted of a great court, "''filled with magic webs woven of the light of [[Laurelin]] and the sheen of [[Telperion|Silpion]] and the glint of [[stars]]''"; still other webs were woven of [[gold]], [[silver]], iron, and bronze. This magic web reflected the [[Music of the Ainur]] as it appeared in the mind of [[Ilúvatar]]. The court also had an area with a "''pool of blue water''" whereabout grew some of every tree that later grew upon the [[Middle-earth|earth]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 73-4</ref>
