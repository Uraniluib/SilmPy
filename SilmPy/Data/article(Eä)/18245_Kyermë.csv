__NOTOC__
'''Kyermë''' means "prayer" in [[Quenya]].

==Etymology==
The etymology is not known. The form of the word would suggest a [[PQ]] [[Sundocarmë|Root]] *KJER and the noun ending ''[[-më]]''.

The word is the only one in Quenya that displays the exceptional sound ''ky''. It has been suggested that it is a [[Númenor]]ean dialect of Quenya or that it is a misreading of ''hy'' (see also ''[[hyam]]'').

In any event, traditional Quenya phonotactics forbids the existence of ''ky'' (having merged it with ''ty'' even before [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] invented [[sarati]]), so even if [[Dúnedain]] used it, it is unlikely the [[Vanyar]] or [[Noldor]] ever did.

== Examples ==
*[[Erukyermë]]: "Prayer to [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]"<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Erukyermë''</ref>

==See also==
*''[[hyam]]'' "to pay"
