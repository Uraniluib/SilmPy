Their own word for themselves was [[Drúedain|Drughu]], but the [[Elves]] adapted this into their own [[Sindarin]] language as [[Drû]] (from which the more common '[[Drúedain]]' derives). From Sindarin, the word passed into [[Quenya]], but again it was changed, and became [[Rú]]. From this comes the plural form 'Rúatani' ('Rú-Men') which is the direct Quenya equivalent of 'Drúedain'.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, note 6</ref>
