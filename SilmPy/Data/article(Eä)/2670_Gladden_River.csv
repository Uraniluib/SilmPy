The '''Gladden''' (called '''''Sîr Ninglor''''' "River Goldwater" by the [[Elves]]) was a short but important river of the [[Vales of Anduin]].

==Course==
The source of the river begun as two unnamed arms in the central [[Misty Mountains]], near an important pass.<ref name=south>{{FR|South}}</ref> It then flowed eastwards to the [[Anduin|Great River Anduin]], which it met in a series of marshes called the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>
==History==
After the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], [[Isildur]], heir of [[Elendil]] and bearer of [[the One Ring]], was assailed by [[Orcs]] near the Gladden Fields, and the One Ring was lost here in the Gladden river.<ref name="Disaster">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

Much later during the [[Third Age]] some [[Stoors]] lived near the streams of Gladden, and from them came [[Déagol]] who found the ring, and was killed by [[Sméagol]] ([[Gollum]]), who long held the Ring. Gollum eventually followed the stream up to its source, ending up in forgotten caves near [[Goblin-town]].<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>

[[Saruman]] searched the Gladden extensively during his search for the Ring, but never found the ring, although he seems to have found [[Isildur]]'s remains.<ref name="Disaster"/>

In {{TA|3018}} some of the scouts sent out by [[Elrond]] after the arrival of the hobbits in [[Rivendell]] crossed the Misty Mountains over the pass at the source of the Gladden to seek the wizard [[Radagast]] at [[Rhosgobel]], but he was not at home, and they return through the [[Dimrill Stair]].<ref name=south/>

==Etymology==
''Gladden'' (From [[Old English]] ''glædene'') is another name for the "flag" or "[[wikipedia:Iris (plant)|iris]]", now usually spelt ''gladdon''.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref>

''Sîr Ninglor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "River Water-gold", apparently consisting of  ''[[sîr]]'' ("river"), ''nîn'' (pl. of ''[[nen]]'' ("water") + ''[[glaur]]'' ("gold").<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com]|accessed=}}</ref>
