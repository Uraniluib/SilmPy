'''Ethring''' was a bridge<ref group="note">The symbol used on the Map of Gondor suggests Ethring was only a bridge; there is no sign of a nearby town or settlement.</ref> in southern [[Gondor]], across the river [[Ringló]].

==History==
Ethring was a major crossing point of the river [[Ringló]], along the main road from [[Erech]] to [[Pelargir]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> [[Aragorn]] and the [[Oathbreakers]] crossed the river here during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Ethring'' perhaps comes from ''[[ath]]'' meaning "across" (cf. [[athrad]] "ford, crossing"). ''Ring'' translates to "cold" (cf. [[Ringló]] river, to which it probably refers).<ref>{{LR|P3}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Ethring was the only settlement in the [[Ringló Vale]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], it was ruled by "Lord Borhador", who dwelt in the Crossing-Hall. Due to Borhador's old age, his son [[Dervorin]] led the soldiers of the Vale to [[Minas Tirith]] in his stead, and his other son "Arvaethor" assisted in protecting the Vale.
