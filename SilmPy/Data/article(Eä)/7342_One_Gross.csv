'''One Gross''' is a measurement equal to 144 of something (a dozen dozens). 

One gross was the number of people invited to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Birthday Party]] in order to much the sum of his and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]
s ages (111 and 33).  However, when [[Bilbo Baggins]] called them thus, many were insulted as the term "gross" was not used properly on people.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>
