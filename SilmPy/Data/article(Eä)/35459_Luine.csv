'''''luine''''' (pl. ''luini'') is a [[Quenya]] word meaning "blue".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 66</ref>

The word occurred mainly in [[Exilic Quenya|Noldorin]] Quenya; the [[Vanyar]] in their [[Vanyarin|dialect]] used ''[[ulban]]'' for blue, adopted and adapted from [[Valarin]].<ref>{{PM|Quendi}}</ref>

==Examples==
*''Vardo tellumar nu luini'' "beneath the blue vaults of [[Varda]]" (''[[Namárië]]'')
==Cognates==
*[[Sindarin]] ''[[luin]]''
==Other versions==

In some linguistic manuscripts, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] experimented with ''luine'' being a cognate of [[Sindarin]] ''[[duin]]'' ("river"), but noted that ''luine'' as meaning "river" was not used. [[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that  ''luine'' meaning "river" perhaps only survived in compounds as '''''-duinë''''' (cf. ''[[Nunduinë#Etymology|Nunduinë]]'').<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 31</ref>
