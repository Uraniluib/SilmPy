The '''Hill-men''' were a race of Men who in the [[Third Age]] were found in [[Eriador]] and became subjects of [[Arnor]].

==Origins==
The Hill-men were likely [[Pre-Númenóreans]] historically descended from the mountain tribes of the [[White Mountains]], who spread northward across [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Second Age]]. The [[Dunlendings]] and the [[Men of Bree]] were of this stock, as were the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]].{{fact}}

It is also possible that they descended from the people of [[Bór]] or other [[Easterlings (First Age)|Swarthy Men]] of the [[First Age]] who came from [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120211145606/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Ind.html|articlename=The Indigenous People of Middle-earth|website=Lalaith}}</ref>
==Third Age==
During the [[Third Age]] the Hill-men were to be found near the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle]] of [[Eriador]] or the [[Ettenmoors]]<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 196</ref> and were subjects of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] Kingdom of the North. From the 14th century the hills were occupied by their dark fortresses<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> and they learned sorcery,<ref>{{PM|Third}}</ref> perhaps from [[Angmar]].

In the [[Angmar War]], '''Hill-men''' from [[Rhudaur]] secretly allied themselves with the [[Witch-king]] and one of their evil lords usurped the throne of Rhudaur, slowly sending the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] fleeing to [[Cardolan]] and [[Arthedain]], and then fighting with Angmar against them until all the kingdom was occupied by evil men.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> The kingdom allied with Angmar against the other two kingdoms.  

Most of the '''Hill-men''' were later wiped out during the [[Battle of Fornost]],<ref>{{HM|FR}}</ref> except for those who lived in Bree and the surrounding area.
