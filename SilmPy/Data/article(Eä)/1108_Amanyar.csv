'''Amanyar''' ("Those of Aman" in [[Quenya]]) was another name for the [[Calaquendi|Elves of the Light]], those who dwelt in [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Úmanyar''</ref> They included the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor|Ñoldor]], and those [[Teleri]] who passed over [[Belegaer]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> 

The Vanyar dwelt with the [[Valar]] in their [[Valmar]], the Noldor in [[Tirion]] (as well as various fortresses and mines in the encircling [[Pelóri]] mountains), and the Teleri in [[Alqualondë]]. After the [[Third Age]], those Noldor who had remained in exile in [[Middle-earth]] returned, followed by many of the [[Sindar]] and [[Silvan Elves]]. The Vanyar and Teleri never departed from Valinor save during the [[War of Wrath]].

One Elf of the Light who was not of the Amanyar was King Thingol.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>
