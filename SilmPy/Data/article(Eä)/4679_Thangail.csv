__NOTOC__
The '''''thangail''''' was a defensive formation used by the soldiers of the [[Númenórean Realms]]. It was formed from two closely-pressed ranks presenting a barrier of shields, solidly enough to withstand the onslaught of their enemies. The thangail was designed to be flexible, and could bend at one or both of its ends to adapt to enemy tactics, even curling round to meet itself and so form an unbroken circle of shields.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

The only record of the thangail in actual use was by [[Isildur]], who ordered one drawn up when attacked by [[Orcs]] in the incident known to history as the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]. However, there is reason to think that it originated with the [[Elves]], especially as the two main [[Elvish]] languages had quite separate names for the formation. Thangail is a [[Sindarin]] word, whereas in [[Quenya]] the same tactic was referred to as a [[sandastan]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 16</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[wikipedia:Shield wall|Shield walls]] were a common element of pre-gunpowder battlefield tactics, e.g. the ancient Greek [[wikipedia:Phalanx formation|phalanx]], Roman legionary [[wikipedia:Testudo formation|testudo formation]] and Scottish [[wikipedia:Sheltron|sheltron]].

==Etymology==
The word ''thangail'' may be translated as 'shield-fence' (''[[than]]'' "shield" + ''[[cail]]'' "fence").{{fact}}
