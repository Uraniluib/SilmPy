{{disambig-two|the pass in [[Mordor]]|[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]] supplement|[[Gates of Mordor (book)]]}}

The '''Gate of Mordor''' (also <b>the gates of Mordor</b>) was a term for the defended pass in the northwest of [[Mordor]], and great [[Black Gate]] - the [[Morannon]] - that protected it. The Gates opened onto a narrow valley, [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]], and were highly defensible. Indeed, they were only successfully assaulted once in their history, by the armies of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]].
