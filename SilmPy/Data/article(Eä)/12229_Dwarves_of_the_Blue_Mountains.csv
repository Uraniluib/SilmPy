The '''Dwarves of the Blue Mountains''' were the various [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] peoples in the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]].
==History==
===First Age===
The [[Firebeards]] and [[Broadbeams]] awoke in [[Mount Dolmed]] in the Blue Mountains, and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

From their mountain-cities, the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains came down into Beleriand to trade with the Elves. The Dwarves of Belegost were friends to the [[Sindar]]<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> and later allies of the [[Noldor]] of [[Beleriand]] (they had generally better relations with the [[Elves]] than their neighbors in [[Nogrod]]).<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> They first met the [[Noldor]] Elves near Mount [[Rerir]] and a great friendship began between the two peoples.

They played a great part in the making of [[Thingol|Thingol's]] halls at [[Menegroth]], and later aided in the delving of [[Nargothrond]] beside [[Narog]].<ref name="Return" /> Finrod rewarded them with treasures he brought from [[Tirion]].<ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref> In Nogrod during this period, the master craftsman [[Telchar]] forged weapons and armour that would be famed through Middle-earth's history, including [[Narsil]], the sword that would be broken and reforged for [[Aragorn]] several millenia later.

After [[Morgoth]]'s return to Middle-earth, the Dwarves were loosely [[Union of Maedhros|allied]] with the Elves in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] that followed. They fought in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where [[Azaghâl]] of [[Belegost]] drove [[Glaurung]] from the field but was himself slain. After the battle, relations between the Elves and Dwarves cooled: Dwarves of Nogrod slew Thingol and stole the [[Nauglamír]], and after this time enmity and mistrust grew between the two peoples.

===Second Age===
After the end of the [[First Age]], around {{SA|40}}, the power and wealth of Khazad-dûm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Despite this, there remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> For hundreds of years, the remnants of the Firebeards and Broadbeams toiled in the Ered Luin. The remnants of the two Houses seemed to have largely moved to the Southern range by the mid-[[Third Age]].{{fact}}

===Third Age===
After the death of King [[Thrór]], his son [[Thráin]] sent messengers to all the Houses of the Dwarves requesting aid, and it can be assumed that both the western houses sent troops to fight in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]].

After the War, the remaining western Dwarves went back to their countries, and a year later King Thráin and his people established a [[Thorin's Halls|new realm-in-exile]] in the northern Ered Luin beyond the [[Little Lune]].<ref name="Durin" /> His people prospered in a fashion and were swelled in numbers by many of the wandering folk of Durin. They made things mostly of iron, trading with their neighbouring kinsmen in the south, the Men of Eriador, and likely the Elves.

Years later after King [[Thorin]] went on the [[Quest of Erebor]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Five Armies]], the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] was re-established by the new king [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]]. Many of the people of Durin's folk went to him and it became a great and prosperous kingdom once again.

Even later in the [[Fourth Age]], there were still Dwarves in mines in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially south of the Gulf of Lune, still trading along the [[East Road]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:While [[Thorin and Company]] are lost in [[Mirkwood]], [[Bofur]] finds a dwarven tobacco pouch on the ground, which he recognizes as one from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] tells him that it is his own pouch that fell earlier, and they are going on circles.
