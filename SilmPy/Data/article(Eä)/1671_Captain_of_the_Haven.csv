The '''Captain of the Haven''' was the leader of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] of [[Umbar]] during the time of the [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] of [[Gondor]].

Sometime between {{TA|2957|n}} and {{TA|2980}}, [[Aragorn]] (in the guise of ''Thorongil'') came to Gondor and during that time counselled Ecthelion concerning the rebellious nature of [[Umbar]]. Ecthelion agreed that Thorongil could send a small fleet; arriving at night they burnt the ships of the unprepared Corsairs whilst Thorongil himself killed the Captain of the Haven.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>
