'''Arvernien''' was the coastland of [[Beleriand]] west of the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. It had the protection of [[Ulmo]].

==History==
Arvernien was originally an uninhabited land, known mainly for the forest of [[Nimbrethil]],<ref>{{HM|S}}, "Index"</ref> but after the rout that became known as the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] and the subsequent destruction of the Havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]], [[Círdan]] and [[Falathrim|his folk]] dwelt in this region. Though at first they lived on the [[Isle of Balar]], they later founded the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref name="5B">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> The area became a known refuge, as when [[Gondolin]] [[Fall of Gondolin|fell]], many of its people fled southward too<ref name="Fall">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> and those were followed by [[Iathrim|refugees]] from [[Doriath]].

The Havens were devastated by the [[Third Kinslaying]] when the remaining [[Sons of Feanor]] came to claim the [[Nauglamir]] held by [[Earendil]]. Following Eärendil's return from his journeys out at sea and the [[War of Wrath]] in which Morgoth was defeated, Beleriand, and Arvernien with it, was destroyed.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Tolkien only ever gave an incomplete translation of the name Arvernien: "(the land) beside the ''[[Verna]]''".<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 19, 71 (July [[2007]])</ref> 

Except the core element Verna, the name can be analyzed as prefix ''[[ar|ar-]]'' meaning "beside, without" (see also ''[[argad]]'') and the geographical ending ''[[-ien]]'' which translates as "land of". The meaning of Verna is, however, unclear. 

Considering that the name was an invention of Tolkien's early legendarium, when Beleriand was still called ''Broseliand'', [[David Salo]] suggested the name might actually have been inspired by the French region of [[wikipedia:Auvergne|Auvergne]].<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/34598 Message 34598]'', [[Elfling]]</ref>
