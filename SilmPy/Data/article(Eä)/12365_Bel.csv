'''''bel''''' is a [[Pre-Númenórean]] word or element of unknown meaning. It is seen in the name ''[[Belfalas]]''.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

The scholars of [[Gondor]] could only speculate the original meaning of ''bel''; it's possible that it has the meaning of "shore" as does the second element ''[[falas]]''. 

Since the great bay between [[Umbar]] and [[Andrast]] (the Long Cape, beyond [[Lefnui]]) was called ''[[Côf]] ([[gwaeren]]) Bêl'' "(windy) Bay of Bêl" scholars also considered possible that ''Bêl'' was the name of the region later called [[Dor-en-Ernil]] before settled by the [[Dúnedain]].<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 15</ref>
