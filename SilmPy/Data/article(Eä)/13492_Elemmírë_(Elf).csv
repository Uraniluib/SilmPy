'''Elemmírë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌelemˈmiːre]}}) was a [[Vanyar|Vanyarin]] Elf, famed for the creation of a lament for the [[Darkening of Valinor]], the [[Aldudénië]]. When [[Morgoth|Melkor]] assaulted  the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], the Vanyar and other Elves of [[Valinor]] were celebrating a festival on [[Taniquetil]], and so Elemmírë most likely personally witnessed the destruction of the Trees. The song the elf made to lament the death of the Two Trees was said to be known by all of the [[Eldar]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Elemmírë is obviously named after the [[star]] [[Elemmírë]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

Note that the form of the word does not allow us to know whether Elemmírë was a male or a female Elf.
