'''Framsburg'''<ref group="note">The name and location of this town first appeared on [[Pauline Baynes]]' ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]'' ([[1970]]).</ref> was the only fortified burg of the [[Éothéod]], the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]], while they lived in the far north by the [[Grey Mountains]] between the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>

Framsburg was probably founded shortly after the Éothéod arrived in {{TA|1977}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> during the rule of [[Frumgar]], but it took its name from his son [[Fram]], the famed slayer of the [[Long-worms|Dragon]] [[Scatha]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

The burg was probably abandoned circa {{TA|2510}} when [[Eorl the Young]] led the Éothéod south to settle [[Calenardhon]], the land later known as [[Rohan]].<ref name="TA"/>
