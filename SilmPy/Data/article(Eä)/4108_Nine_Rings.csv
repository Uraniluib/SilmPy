The '''Nine Rings''' were those of the [[Rings of Power]] that [[Sauron]] used to corrupt [[Men]] to his service; those who took the Nine Rings became the [[Nazgûl]].

==History==
The rings were made along with the others in [[Eregion]] and were forged by [[Celebrimbor]].  Those were locked away in one of the safes of [[Eregion]], but all were captured by Sauron. He gave nine of them to nine kings of Men, three of which were [[Númenóreans]] and [[Khamûl|one]] was an [[Easterlings|Easterling]].  

The owners of the nine eventually became the [[Nazgûl]].      

During the end of the [[Third Age]], possibly Sauron had taken the Nine Rings with him in order to augment his power.
<ref>"the Nine [Sauron] has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed." {{HM|FR}}, [[The Shadow of the Past]]</ref><ref>"You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine." {{HM|FR}}, [[The Mirror of Galadriel]]</ref>

==Effect==
The [[Rings of Power]] gave their wearer powerful magical abilities and gave them the ability to influence peoples' will. 

On Men those effects could be special: The rings gave a very long life, but the wearer would begin to feel worn out and eventually fade away into a wraith.  The nine kings given the rings turned into [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] because Sauron was able to take control of the rings.

==Appendix==
===Possession of the [[Nine Rings]]===
In ''[[The Council of Elrond]]'', [[Gandalf]] says that the [[Nazgûl]] kept their Rings by saying "The Nine the Nazgûl keep"<ref>{{HM|FR}}, [[The Council of Elrond]]</ref>. However in most other references, it is mentioned that Sauron had taken them. Furthermore, Frodo doesn't see any Rings on them on [[Weathertop]], and it is believed that if they did wear the Rings, they would have been fully [[Unseen|invisible]] (including their cloaks).

It's possible that the line in the Council of Elrond represents Tolkien's earlier intention that the Nazgûl should still be wearing their Rings; if that's so, he later changed his mind and simply missed revising that sentence.<ref>http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q0-InvRiders</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
