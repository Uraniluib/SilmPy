The '''Battle of the Lammoth''' was fought against the [[Orcs]] in the [[Lammoth]] soon after [[Fingolfin]] and his host arrived in [[Middle-earth]].  During the conflict [[Argon]], Fingolfin's youngest child, fell.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of FinwÃ«'s descendants''</ref>  The Orcs made a surprise attack upon the [[Elves]], who began to give way when Argon dashed forward and cut a path to the Orc-captain, whom he slew.  The Orcs surrounded and killed Argon, but his brave deed turned the fortunes of the battle.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, Note 38</ref>
