The '''Seven Gates of Gondolin''' were seven mighty gates guarding the [[Orfalch Echor]].  They were built by [[King of Gondolin|King]] [[Turgon]] to protect [[Gondolin]] from invasion; however, it was not through these that the host of [[Morgoth]] came in the [[Fall of Gondolin]].  It was through these that [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] passed to get into [[Tumladen]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

Each of the gates had their own form and special guard.  The gates are listed below, from the end of the Orfalch furthest from Gondolin to the one bordering Tumladen.

* [[Gate of Wood]]
* [[Gate of Stone]]
* [[Gate of Bronze]]
* [[Gate of Writhen Iron]]
* [[Gate of Silver]]
* [[Gate of Gold]]
* [[Gate of Steel]]
