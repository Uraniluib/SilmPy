The '''Dírnaith''', also known by its [[Quenya]] name ''[[Nernehta]]'', means ''man-spearhead''.  It was a wedge formation launched over a short distance against an enemy massing but not yet arrayed, or against a defensive formation on open ground.  It was designed by the [[Númenóreans]] for rapid attack against an opposing force before it could properly array itself for battle and it relied on the great strength and Stature of the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 16</ref>
