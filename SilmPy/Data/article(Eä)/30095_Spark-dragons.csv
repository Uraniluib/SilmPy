'''Spark-dragons''' were a breed of [[dragons]] of whom all that is known is from the nomenclature by the [[Eldar]].<ref name=Ety>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 370 (entry for ''LOK-''); cf. entry ''PHAY-'', p. 381</ref> No story tells of their appearance in the history of [[Arda]], but one can assume that somehow they radiated light (and therefore perhaps were related to, or were another name for, the ''[[great glow-worms]]'').

==Names and Etymology==
In [[Quenya]], the name of the creature is ''fealóke'', consisting of ''fea'' ("spark"; from [[Sundocarme|root]] PHAY-, "radiate, send out rays of light") and ''lóke'' ("dragon"; from root LOK-, "great serpent, dragon").<ref name=Ety/>
