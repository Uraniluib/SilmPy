The '''Stock Road''' was a road in [[the Shire]].

It begun from the village of [[Stock]], passed through the [[Woody End]] and the [[Green Hills]].

At the end of the [[Third Age]] ([[22 September]], {{TA|3021}}), [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] met the [[Keepers of the Three Rings]] in Woody End, waiting on the Stock Road.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>
==Identification==
The road is not marked on the map ''[[A Part of the Shire]]''. However there is an unnamed road joining [[Tuckborough]] with Stock through Green Hill Country and Woody End. [[Karen Fonstad]] identifies this road as the Stock Road.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 71, The Shire</ref>

According to [[Robert Foster]], the Stock Road joined the [[East Road]] west of [[Bywater]] but no such road does so on said map.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 365, entry "Stock Road"</ref>
