'''Uinen''' was [[Ossë]]'s wife. A [[Maiar|Maia]] of [[Ulmo]], she was known as the '''Lady of the Sea'''.
==Attributes==
Uinen loved and protected all creatures and weeds that live in the sea and brought calm seas. She could calm the tumultous waves of her husband [[Ossë]] and for this she was loved by mariners. She was revered among the [[Ainur]] by the [[Númenoreans]].<ref name=vala>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

It is said that her hair spread through all the surface of water.<ref name=vala/>

== History ==
Early in the history of [[Arda]], Ossë was corrupted by [[Morgoth]] but [[Aulë]] pleaded Uinen to persuade him to return to the service of Ulmo.<ref name=vala/>

The [[Teleri]] of [[Olwë]] had much love for Uinen, as she and Ossë had befriended them at the river [[Sirion]] during the [[Great March]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

Uinen wept for the Teleri mariners after the kinslaying at [[Alqualondë]] and rose a storm that sunk many [[Noldor]] on the stolen [[Swan-ships]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

Considered a protector and bringer of calm seas by the mariners of [[Númenor]], they would cry to her for help, while their respect for the [[Valar]] endured.<ref name=vala/> The [[Guild of Venturers]] were also known as [[Uinendili]].<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Two explanations exist for the name ''Uinen''. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the first element came from a root UY-. Several other words under this lemma mean "seaweed", though the name Uinen itself is not explained.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root UY-</ref> A later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish ([[Valarin]]) origin of unknown meaning.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 404</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that ''Uinen'' contains the element ''[[nén|nen]]'' ("water").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, (entry ''nen'')</ref> It is unknown if he had access to unpublished manuscripts by his father to corroborate this suggestion or if he speculated on the matter.

==Other Versions of the legendarium==
In the [[Annals of Aman]], Uinen and [[Ossë]] were originally counted among the Valar.

In early versions of the [[legendarium]], the character was named ''Ónen'', ''Solórë'', or ''Ui'' (among other names), and was given the title "Queen of [[Mermaids]]".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 263</ref><ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 97</ref>
