The '''Guards of the Citadel''' or '''Tower of Gondor''' were those honoured guards of [[Minas Tirith]] who were charged with protecting the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]], the highest and most important tier of the city, and participated in official functions.<ref name="MT">{{RK|V1}}</ref>  When on duty they were not permitted to leave their post for any cause, save at the command of their lord.<ref name="Siege">{{RK|V4}}</ref>

They also guarded the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] that stood in the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]]. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] it had been dead for nearly 150 years,<ref>{{App|TA}}, 2872</ref> until the new King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and [[Gandalf]] found a new seedling of the Tree,<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> and the Guards' great duty was refounded.

==Appearance and Attire==
At the end of the [[Third Age]], they were the only soldiers of [[Gondor]] entitled to wear the [[Livery of Elendil]] [[Elendil|himself]] - a white tree in blossom, surmounted by a silver crown and stars, all embroidered on a field of black. They also bore heirlooms of [[Gondor]]'s ancient wealth, tall helmets wrought out of ''[[mithril]]'', with close-fitting cheek-guards and bearing the carved wings of sea-birds.<ref name="MT"/> On [[10 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Peregrin Took]] was arrayed as a Guard of the Citadel, at the command of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] [[Denethor]].  His appearance in this uniform gave strength to the rumour that he was indeed ''[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]'', the Prince of the Halflings.<ref name="Siege"/>

==Organisation==
There were at least three companies, each of which had its own storehouse; [[Beregond]], son of [[Baranor (man of Gondor)|Baranor]] belonged to the Third Company.<ref name="MT"/> The Captain-general of the Guards was probably the heir of the throne; during the time of the [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards]] it was the heir of the Steward.
