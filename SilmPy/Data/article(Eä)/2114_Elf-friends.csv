The '''Elf-friends''' were those, usually among [[Men]], who were recognised by the [[Elves]] as providing special aid or alliance to their efforts. Elf-friend was given as title or epithet.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Elf-friends"</ref> 

==Notable Elf-friends==
* The [[Edain]] in general<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>
* [[Hador]]
** [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]]
** [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]
** [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]
* [[Elrond]]<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>
* [[Elendil]]
* [[Bilbo Baggins]]
* [[Frodo Baggins]]
* [[Gimli]]

==Other uses==
The [[Quenya]] terms were technically ''[[Eldandil]]'' ("Devoted to the [[Eldar]]"), or ''[[Quendil]]'' ("Devoted to the [[Quendi]]") or ''[[Elesser]]''. 

Among the [[Edain]] and [[Dúnedain]], the Elvish words for "Elf" and "[[stars|star]]" were often confused, since they sounded similar. Thus ''[[Elendil]]'' or ''[[Elvellon]]'' was used by them to mean "Elf-friend", though it actually signifies "Devoted to the Stars". 

The plural form ''[[Elendili]]'' was one of the names for the [[Faithful]] [[Númenóreans]].

==Inspiration==
The concept of the "Elf-friend" is recurrent in Tolkien's legendarium, both in meaning and in name. The name [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ælfwine Ælfwine/Elfwine] is an actual [[Old English]] personal name that means "Elf-friend" and has survived in modern times as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alboin_%28disambiguation%29 Alboin] or Alwin/Elwin. This word has been the basis for several characters and terms:
* [[Elendil]]
* [[Nimruzîr]] 
* [[Elvellon]]
* [[Elfwine]] son of [[Éomer]]
* [[Ælfwine]] of England (also known as [[Eriol]])
* [[Alwin Lowdham]]
* [[Alboin]]
