}}'''Dúnhere''' was the chieftain of the folk of [[Harrowdale]], and a valiant captain who fought in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

==History==
Dúnhere was a nephew of [[Erkenbrand]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, note 13</ref> He served under [[Grimbold]] during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], where his skill as a horseman proved important to the [[Rohirrim]]'s weakened defenses.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Dúnhere did not accompany [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]; instead, they sent him to oversee the muster of the Rohirrim in his native Harrowdale. Several days later, [[Théoden]] and the rest of the riders gathered there to set out to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Muster}}</ref>

At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Dúnhere was slain. He was remembered in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Dúnhere'' means "hill warrior" in [[Old English]], consisting of ''[[Wiktionary:dun#Old_English|dūn]]'' ("hill") + ''[[Wiktionary:here#Old_English|here]]'' ("army, host").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 571</ref>
