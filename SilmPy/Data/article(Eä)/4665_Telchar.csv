'''Telchar''' was a [[Dwarves of Nogrod | Dwarf]] of [[Nogrod]] in the [[Blue Mountains]], and one of the greatest smiths in the history of [[Middle-earth]]. 

== History ==
Telchar was trained by [[Gamil Zirak]], another great smith.<ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref>  Among his works were [[Angrist]] (the knife that freed the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]]),<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> [[Narsil]] (the sword of [[Elendil]], later reforged for [[Aragorn]] as [[Andúril]]),<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref> and the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]].<ref name="Narn"/>
==Etymology==
It is not defined whether the name Telchar is [[Sindarin]] or [[Khuzdul]]. The formation seems to suggest to be Sindarin since the digraph ''ch'' is not used in Khuzdul.<ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] notes a resemblance to the ''[[Wikipedia:Telchines|Telchines]]'' of Greek mythology, a mythological race of divine craftsmen.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, p. 89</ref>
