In the early versions of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]] (see: ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''), the [[Falmari]] were known as '''Solosimpi''' ("Pipers of the Shores"), while the name [[Teleri]] was given to the clan of [[Elves]] known as the [[Vanyar]].

Their leader was [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] but after he was lost, they chose [[Ellu|Ellu Melemno]].<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 132</ref>

The Solosimpi dwelt in [[Alqualondë|Kopas Alqaluntë]] but many were [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|slaughtered]] by the [[Gnomes]] under [[Fëanor]].<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 234</ref>

Their preferred weapon was the [[bow]] and arrow, in contrast to the [[spear]]s of the [[Vanyar|Teleri]] and the [[sword]]s of the Gnomes.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 215 footnote to §29</ref>
