'''''kwende''''' pl. '''''kwendî''''' is the [[Primitive Quendian]] word for the [[Elves]].<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, [[Quendi and Eldar]] p. 360</ref> The word was perhaps primarily used in the plural.
==Etymology==
Formed from the [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[KWE]]NE (see ''[[kwene]]'') with ''[[ostime]]'' of ''n > nd''. 

Since KWENE is probably expanded from KWE, the most primitive stem having to do with articulate speech, the term ''kwendî'' identifies the Elves as "speakers".<ref>{{S|3}}: "''Themselves they named the Quendi, signifying those that speak with voices, for as yet they had met no other living things that spoke or sang.''"</ref>

==Derivatives==
Note that the final short ''-e'' was not lost in the later languages, as it usually happens with other words.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' [[Quenya]] ''[[quendë]]'' "Elf" is derived from a stem KWEN(ED) simply defined as "Elf", and the primitive form is given as ''kwenedê''.
