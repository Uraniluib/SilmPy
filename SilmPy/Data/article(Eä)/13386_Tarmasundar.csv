The '''Tarmasundar''', or "Roots of the Pillar", were the five ridges that made up the base of the [[Meneltarma]], a mountain in the middle of the island of [[Númenor]]. Each root extended in the direction of the five promontories of that island.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name comes from the [[Quenya]] words ''[[tarma]]'', meaning "pillar" (referring to [[Meneltarma]]), and *''[[sunda]]'', meaning "root".
