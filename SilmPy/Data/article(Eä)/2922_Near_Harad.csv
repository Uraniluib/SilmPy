'''Near Harad''' was an indefinite region that lay to the south of [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]], beyond the River [[Harnen]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Little is said of it in the histories of [[Middle-earth]], except that the [[Men]] of that land conspired with those of [[Khand]], and with the [[Wainriders]], to overthrow Gondor in the time of King [[Ondoher]]. The [[Gondorians]] anticipated their strike, and [[Ondoher]] created a [[Southern Army]] to defend his land against them. That Southern Army, under the command of [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], met the invading Men of Near Harad in [[South Ithilien]], and defeated them completely.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Though Near Harad is not otherwise described in any detail, its inhabitants were clearly great enemies of the Gondorians, and it seems likely that many of the [[Haradrim]] who troubled Gondor, actually are the Men of Near Harad. This is especially true of their dealings with the Gondorian outpost of [[Umbar]], which lay on the western shores of Near Harad. It was home to camels and, in the South, [[Oliphaunts]].<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref>
