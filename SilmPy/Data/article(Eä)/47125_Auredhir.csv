'''Auredhir''' was the son of [[Dior]] and the brother of [[Elwing]]. It is said that his looks were akin to his grandfather [[Beren]] and for that reason he was loved by all. He was slain by [[sons of Fëanor|the sons of Fëanor]] in their attempt to reclaim the [[Nauglamír|Nauglafring]].<ref>{{LT2 | IV}}, pp. 240-1</ref> 

Auredhir disappeared completely from later legends, whereas his sister Elwing had remained. <ref>{{LT2 | IV}}, p. 251</ref>
