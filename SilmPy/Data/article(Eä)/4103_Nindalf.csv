'''Nindalf''', or '''Wetwang''' in [[Westron]], was a swampy land of pathless fen beneath the [[Emyn Muil]].<ref name="Farewell">{{FR|II8}}</ref>

As the great inland delta of the [[Entwash]] fed Anduin from the west, and Anduin divided into many channels, marshlands were formed to the east of the Great River, south of the [[Emyn Muil]]. The [[Dead Marshes]] lay further east and may have been an extension of Wetwang.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

On [[16 February]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Celeborn]] warned the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] against becoming lost in the region, recommending instead that those heading to [[Minas Tirith]] leave the river above the Falls of [[Rauros]].<ref name="Farewell"/>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]], consisting of ''[[n√Æn]]'' ("wet") and ''[[talf]]'' ("flat field").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 52</ref><ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 779</ref>

''Wetwang' is the [[Westron]] translation. The archaic meaning of ''wang'' means "field, flat area".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 779</ref>

Wetwang is a real-life place-name in Yorkshire.<ref name="Nomen" />
