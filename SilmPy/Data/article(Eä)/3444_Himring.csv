'''Himring''' was a hill in the northeast of [[Beleriand]]. It was east of the [[Pass of Aglon]] and west of [[Maglor's Gap]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> The greatest hill of that region, it was wide-shouldered, treeless, with a flattened summit, and surrounded by numerous lesser hills.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> After the [[War of Wrath|drowning of]] [[Beleriand]] at the end of the [[First Age]], the peak of Himring remained above the waves.<ref name=UTIMap>{{UT|IMap}}</ref>

==History==
===The fortress of Maedhros===
The fortress on Himring was built when the Sons of Fëanor went east after [[Thingol]] became aware of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]]. It was the chief fortress of [[Maedhros]], eldest of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], from which he guarded the north-eastern border region that became known as the [[March of Maedhros]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

The fortress stood firm through the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and many survivors from the surrounding regions, including Maedhros' brother [[Maglor]], rallied there. In the battle the [[Orcs]] had taken the [[Pass of Aglon]], but Maedhros was later able to retake the Pass using the forces from Himring.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Himring's fortress remained for centuries, until the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]; it's possible that it was forsaken, as the sons of Fëanor would no longer have had the strength to man it, had they so chosen.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===The Island===
[[File:Didier Willis - Location of Tol Morwen.png|thumb|300px|Remnants of sunken Beleriand: the islands west of Forlindon, Tol Himling, [[Tol Fuin]] and (speculatively) [[Tol Morwen]].]]
After the [[War of Wrath]], when the western lands were flooded, the plains about the hill were drowned and the top of the hill was all that remained of Himring. Left standing as an island, Himring lay off the north-west coast, about twenty-five miles out from the shores of northern [[Lindon]].<ref name=UTIMap/>

==Etymology==
Literally, the name means "cool-cold".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''him''</ref><ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 200</ref> Himring is translated as "Ever-cold".<ref name="Beleriand"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the original maps that accompany ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the island was labelled ''Himling'', since this was Tolkien's early name for what later would become ''Himring'' in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=UTIMap/><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxvii</ref>
