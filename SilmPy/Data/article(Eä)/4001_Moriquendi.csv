{{quote|Those Elves the [[Calaquendi]] call the Úmanyar, since they came never to the land of Aman and the Blessed Realm; but the Úmanyar and the Avari alike they call the Moriquendi, Elves of the Darkness, for they never beheld the Light that was before the Sun and Moon.|''[[The Silmarillion]]''<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>}}

The '''Moriquendi''' (singular ''Moriquende'') were the '''Elves of Darkness''', who did not behold the Light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]. 

The term usually referred to the [[Avari]], the [[Elves]] that did not join the [[Great Journey]] over the sea and remained in the [[East]] or passed the [[Blue Mountains]] and lingered on the shores of Middle-earth. However the term included also the [[Úmanyar]] ("Those not of [[Aman]]"), the [[Eldar]] who originally started on the journey but for some reason did not finish it. Those were typically [[Sindar]] and [[Nandor]].

An exception to this categorization was King [[Thingol]], who had been in [[Valinor]] as an ambassador of the Elves, and saw the Light. Though he did not complete the journey, and therefore considered one of the ''Úmanyar'', he was not a Dark Elf. 

Out of the 144 unbegotten Elves to awaken at [[Cuiviénen]], 82 chose to remain and thus became the forefathers of the Moriquendi, outnumbering the population of the [[Amanyar]].<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}</ref><ref group=note>In other words, the Dark Elves consisted of the 57% of the Unbegotten Elven population in the beginning of days.</ref>

The term "'''Dark Elf'''" seems to hold an additional special (not explained) meaning, as it is given as a special title of [[Eöl]] of [[Nan Elmoth]]. It is also used as an insult by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] to King Thingol (which is incorrect, since Thingol alone of the Sindar was reckoned under the Calaquendi).
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tolkien said that in his earliest conception, the Dark Elves were "imagined as wandering about, and often ill-disposed towards the 'Light-Elves'". Later he considered an additional use of the term: "sometimes applied to Elves captured by [[Morgoth]] and enslaved and then released to do mischief among the Elves." He thought that this latter idea should be taken up for Eöl.<ref>{{WJ|III}}</ref>
==Inspiration==

In Norse mythology, there are the [[Light-elves|Light Elves]] (''[[Wikipedia:Light elves|Ljósálfar]]'') and the Dark Elves (''Dökkálfar'' or ''[[Wikipedia:Svartálfar|Svartálfar]]''), a tradition which was well known to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>{{HM|SG}}, "Appendix A: Origins of the Legend", p. 359</ref>
