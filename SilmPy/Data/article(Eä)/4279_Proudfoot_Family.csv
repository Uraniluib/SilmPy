The '''Proudfoot Family''' was a family of [[Shire-hobbits|Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]].

If [[Odo Proudfoot]] is to be taken as an example, at least some members of the family boasted large and exceptionally (even for Hobbits) hairy feet.<ref name=Party/>

There is some uncertainty among [[Hobbits]] about the plural form of "Proudfoot" - the family themselves apparently used "Proudfeet", but [[Bilbo Baggins]] pointedly preferred "Proudfoots".<ref name=Party>{{FR|Party}}</ref>
