The '''Corsairs of Umbar''' were sea-raiders and pirates of the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]]. Umbar was an old [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] haven settled by the "[[King's Men]]" or Black Númenóreans,<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> a proud faction loyal to the King and opposed to the divine authority of the [[Valar]]. 

==History==
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the Umbar settlers further descended into evil, and were called the [[Black Númenóreans]]. They took to pillaging and piracy along the coasts of [[Gondor]]. 

During the [[Kin-strife]], the defeated rebels of [[Castamir]] fled Gondor to Umbar — by this time Umbar became the hated enemy of Gondor and a welcome refuge for its enemies. Ever since they claimed [[Harondor]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

[[Angamaite]] and [[Sangahyando]], the descendants of Castamir, led the Corsairs again [[Pelargir]] where stayed King [[Minardil]] and slew him ({{TA|1634}}). In the following years the Corsairs raided the Gondorian coasts up to [[Anfalas]], until [[Umbardacil]] avenged Minardil's death, retook Umbar and slew the last descendants of Castamir ({{TA|1810}}).<ref name="Gondor"/> 

Eventually Umbar was taken by the [[Haradrim]]<ref name="Gondor"/> and mixed with the Corsairs. The [[Númenórean]] blood was mostly gone in that mixed people. The Corsairs once more harried the coasts of Gondor during the time of [[Cirion]].<ref name=Stewards/> 

In {{TA|2758}} three Corsair fleets attacked and waged war on all the Gondorian coasts until [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|Beregond]] overcame the invaders.<ref name=Stewards/> 

In the time of [[Ecthelion II]], a man under his service known as [[Thorongil]], warned him that the Corsairs were a great peril for the [[Southern Fiefs]]. With a small fleet, Thorongil made a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]], burning a great part of their ships and overthrowing the [[Captain of the Haven]].<ref name=Stewards>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], a fleet of Corsairs was raiding [[Lebennin]] when [[Aragorn]] captured their ships<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> and rowed them to [[Minas Tirith]] to relieve the siege of the city.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

The threat was finally subdued during the reign of King Elessar.<ref name="Gondor"/>

==Culture==
The corsairs were recognizable by their red sails, adorned with a black star or eye.<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Corsairs are from the [[Mordor]] faction, and are equipped with knives and fire-bombs.
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Corsairs were led by four brothers who falsely call themselves the Heirs of [[Castamir]]. These were Azruthor, Dolgimil, Azgarzôr, and the eldest Balakhôr the Scourge. The player negotiated with a Corsair named Jajax, who ended up siding with the player against the Heirs and their followers.
