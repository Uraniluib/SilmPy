'''Vëantur''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[veˈantur]}}) was the [[Captain of the King's Ships]] during the reign of [[Tar-Elendil]], the fourth [[King of Númenor]].

In {{SA|600}} Vëantur commanded the ''[[Entulessë]]'' or "''Return''", the first [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ship to venture back to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  He sailed into the [[Grey Havens]] and became acquainted with [[Círdan]]<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>, the Elven King [[Gil-galad]], and [[Pre-Númenóreans|twelve Men]] from [[Eriador]] who came to see those "who had returned from death in the deeps of the Sea".<ref name="Note3"/>

Vëantur's daughter, [[Almarian]], married [[Tar-Meneldur|Meneldur]], who would be the fifth King of Númenor, and bore him a son, [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]].  Vëantur greatly loved his grandson and welcomed him often to his house, where Aldarion learned how to row, to sail, and then to captain his own ship.  In {{SA|725}}, when Aldarion was twenty-five years old, the aging Vëantur invited him to sail to Middle-earth to meet Círdan and Gil-galad.  Aldarion obtained Meneldur's permission and in the great ship ''[[Númerrámar]]'' or "West-wings", Vëantur and Aldarion proceeded to journey to the eastern lands on a voyage that lasted two years.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Vëantur's name means either "Commander of [[Men]]" or "Manly Commander" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[vëan]]'', 'man', 'manliness' and ''[[-ntur]]'', meaning 'commander').
