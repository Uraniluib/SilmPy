'''Vidumavi''' (died {{TA|1344}})<ref name="PMA">{{PM|Ai}}</ref>, also known as '''Galadwen''', was the daughter of [[Vidugavia]], the [[King of Rhovanion]].<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
Vidumavi married [[Valacar]], the son of [[Minalcar]], the [[King of Gondor]]. She had a child, [[Vinitharya]], later to be known as King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]]. Vidumavi met Valacar in her homeland of  [[Rhovanion]]. He was sent there by his father who sought to attach the Northmen closer to [[Gondor]] than they already were. Valacar and Vidumavi fell in love, and they were wed. They had a son, [[Vinitharya]], in [[Third Age]] {{TA|1255|n}}. In {{TA|1260|n}} Vidumavi was brought by her husband to Gondor from Rhovanion where she was welcomed for her fairness and nobleness.

She was, as the [[Dúnedain]] of Gondor feared, short-lived (dying in 1344 of the [[Third Age]],<ref name="PMA"/> before Valacar became king), though she was very old for one of her own people. She bore Valacar a son, the future King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]]. Because of Eldacar's short-lived, non-Dúnadan mother, many Gondorians were unwilling to accept him as king, leading to the disastrous [[Kin-strife]].<ref name="gondor"/>
