'''Ithilien''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[iˈθiljen]}}) was a region and fiefdom of [[Gondor]]. 

==History==
Historians in [[Gondor]] believed that, in the [[First Age]], the [[Drúedain|Woses]] reached the region and were the first to cross the [[Anduin]] (probably near [[Cair Andros]]).<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>

Old records preserved in [[Gondor]] indicate that the name ''[[Arnen]]'' was once used for the larger part of the region during the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 17</ref>

When [[Elendil]] and his sons founded the [[Realms in Exile]], Ithilien took its name after his son, [[Isildur]]. Of old its chief city was ''Minas Ithil'', the Tower of the Moon. It was briefly captured by [[Sauron]] in {{SA|3429}} but was restored. Ithilien was a fair and prosperous land during the [[Second Age]] and the first part of the [[Third Age]], when Gondor was strong and Mordor deserted. 

In {{TA|541}} [[Easterlings]] invaded northern Ithilien and King [[Rómendacil I]] was killed .<ref name="TA"/>
[[File:Alan Lee - Cirith Ungol.jpg|left|thumb|"Cirith Ungol" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
[[Amon Dîn]] was used as a fortified outpost of Minas Tirith keeping watch over the passage into North Ithilien from [[Dagorlad]] and any attempt by enemies to cross the [[Anduin]] near [[Cair Andros]].<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 510</ref> The [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] was also defending Ithilien from attacks from Sauron's remaining servants and stopped them from returning to Mordor, guarding the high pass over the [[Ephel Dúath]]. Gondor occupied the fortress until {{TA|1636}} when the [[Great Plague]] killed large parts of the population. During the plague most of the people of [[Osgiliath]] fled the city for the western dales or the woods of Ithilien.

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains]] in {{TA|1856}}, Ithilien was the only land east of the river Anduin to be occupied as the others were abandoned.

In {{TA|1899}}, Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|King Calimehtar]] that the [[Wainriders]] were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]]. Calimehtar therefore provoked the Wainriders out of Ithilien, and his horsemen, joined by a large [[éored]] led by [[Marhwini]], drove the Wainriders back.<ref name="Cirion"/>

In {{TA|1944}}, [[Wainriders]] from [[Rhûn]] made an alliance with the [[Haradrim]], and a dual attack on Ithilien was launched. While the Wainriders assaulted Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the [[Poros]] and invaded [[South Ithilien]]. The Gondorian [[Captain of the Southern Army|Captain]] [[Earnil II|Eärnil]] leading Gondor's inferior [[Southern Army]], defeated the Haradrim, and then turned north, [[Battle of the Camp|took]] the Wainriders into surprise and pushed many of them into the swamplands of the [[Dead Marshes]]. 

When Minas Ithil was captured by Mordor in {{TA|2002}} it was renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Tower of Black Sorcery. During the [[Watchful Peace]] the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the [[Uruk-hai]], and in {{TA|2475}} these creatures assailed and overran Ithilien, captured [[Osgiliath]] and destroyed the great stone-bridge.
===Deserting===
[[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]] defeated the host of Morgul and regained Ithilien.  However, from that time on no people dwelt in that region, and for Gondor there was never full peace again until after the defeat of Sauron.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

In {{TA|2885}}, Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King [[Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]] fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the crossings of [[Poros]], though the princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref>

The majority of the people of Ithilien fled across the [[Anduin]] to escape war ({{TA|2901}})<ref name=TA/>, but the [[Stewards of Gondor]] still kept scouts there, operating out of secret locations such as [[Henneth Annûn]]. Those who stayed fled to regions such as [[Lossarnach]] when [[Mount Doom]] erupted in {{TA|2954}}. [[Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] constructed the [[Rammas Echor]] as part of the now necessary defenses of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 546</ref>

The descendants of the people who had dwelt in Ithilien, formed the corps of the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].

===War of the Ring and later===

During the [[War of the Ring]], in early March {{TA|3019}}, [[Faramir]] the son of the Steward [[Denethor]], was leading the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] to ambush Haradrim who would pass through Ithilien. That same time, [[Gollum]] led [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] through Ithilien on their way to [[Cirith Ungol]] and into Mordor, and Faramir allowed them to continue when he was satisfied they were not agents of [[Sauron]].
[[File:Alan Lee - Oliphaunt.jpg|thumb|"Oliphaunt" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
When the [[Host of the West]] marched on the [[Morannon]], [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]] and his troops discovered an ambush by Orcs and Easterlings that lay hid in Ithilien. The ambush was quickly turned.<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>

During the [[Fourth Age]], Ithilien was ruled by the [[Prince of Ithilien|Princes of Ithilien]], a line that started with Faramir and [[Éowyn]], who became known as the White Lady of Ithilien. Minas Morgul was not repopulated, and Faramir had his throne in [[Emyn Arnen]]. 

After the fall of Sauron, around {{FoA|20}},<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> Legolas brought south Elves out of Greenwood, and they dwelt in Ithilien, and it became once again the fairest country in all the westlands.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> They stayed in Ithilien for "a hundred years of Men."<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> After King Aragorn died, Legolas sailed West, reportedly taking Gimli with him, and with them left numerous other [[Elves]].<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref><ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:Ted_Nasmith_-_First_Sight_of_Ithilien.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''First Sight of Ithilien'']]
Ithilien was the only part of Gondor on the eastern side of the [[Anduin]], wedged in between the river and the [[Ephel Dúath]]. The northern border must have been around the [[Dead Marshes]] and its southern border was the river [[Poros]]. The region was further divided into [[North Ithilien|North]] and [[South Ithilien]] (the division was made at or near the [[Cross-roads]]).

[[Iris]]es, [[Anemones]], [[Eglantine]], [[lilies]], [[water-lilies]] and [[Asphodel]] grew in Ithilien<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}</ref>. [[Lebethron]]<ref>{{TT|Journey}}</ref> and [[Culumalda]] grew especially in the woods around the [[Field of Cormallen]].<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 625-6 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref><ref name=SApp>{{S|Appendix}} (entry for ''mal-'')</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Ithilien.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Ithilien'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "land of the moon".<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 233</ref> It has been suggested that the name consists of the elements ''[[Moon#Other names|Ithil]]'' ("moon") + the affix ''[[-nd|end]]''.<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 20 July 2011)</ref>
