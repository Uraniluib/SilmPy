The '''Phial of Galadriel''', or '''Star-glass''', was the [[Gifts of Galadriel|gift]] that [[Galadriel]] bestowed to [[Frodo Baggins]]. 

==History==
[[File:Tim Kirk - Galadriel.jpg|thumb|left|Tim Kirk - ''Galadriel'']]
Galadriel gave Frodo this gift upon the Fellowship's departure from [[Lothlórien]].<ref name="Farewell">{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> It would stay among his possessions unused until reaching the edge of [[Mordor]].

As Frodo, Sam and Gollum approached the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]], Frodo saw a great mass of cavalrymen led by the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]]. When the Witch-king stopped, Frodo feared they had been spotted; against his will, Frodo moves his hand towards the [[The One Ring|ring]]. Instead, he touched  the Phial - which he had forgotten - and the Witch-king continued on his way.<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>

Both Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] used the phial to fend off the attacks of [[Shelob]], and escape her [[Shelob's Lair|lair]] on the borders of [[Mordor]].<ref name=Lair>{{TT|Lair}}</ref> Sam later used it to overcome the will of the [[Two Watchers]] at the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref> Sam also attempted to use the light in the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]] but the light from the glass faded because they were in the heart of [[Sauron]]'s domain.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

When [[Gollum]] led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair, Frodo exclaimed in [[Quenya]], "''[[Aiya]] [[Eärendil]] [[Elenion]] [[Ancalima]]!''",<ref name=Lair/> translating as "Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!". This is in reference to the light of the star of [[Eärendil]], the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] he wore upon his brow, the brightest star in the sky.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> It was the light of this star which is trapped within the Star-glass.<ref name="Farewell"/>

Upon Frodo's departure from [[Middle-earth]], the light from the phial faded as it reached the shores of [[Eldamar]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>
