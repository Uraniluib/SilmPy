'''Lord of the Glittering Caves''' was a title created by the [[Dwarves|dwarf]] [[Gimli]] son of [[Gl√≥in]] for the overlordship of [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]]. It is not known who succeeded him, if anyone.

After the downfall of [[Sauron]], [[Gimli]] led a party of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to Aglarond, the [[Glittering Caves]] of the [[White Mountains]] within the realm of [[Rohan]], of which there was an entrance in [[Helm's Deep]]. There they founded a colony, and Gimli became known as the Lord of the Glittering Caves. His Dwarves performed great services for the [[Rohirrim]] and the [[Men]] of [[Gondor]], of which the most famous was the making of new gates for [[Minas Tirith]], forged out of ''[[mithril]]'' and steel.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>
