'''Ae Adar Nín''' ("Pater noster" in [[Sindarin]]) is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s Sindarin translation of most of the [[Lord's Prayer (disambiguation)|Lord's Prayer]]. He left the last two lines untranslated, but his notes show that he intended to use ''[[úthaes]]'' as the word for "temptation" (cognate with [[Quenya|Q.]] ''úsahtië''). The poem can be read in [[Vinyar Tengwar 44|''Vinyar Tengwar'', no. 44]] on pages 21-30, edited by [[Bill Welden]].

Tolkien's notes on the poem, written on the back of a postcard, are reproduced on the cover of [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 4|''Tolkien Studies'': Volume 4]].<ref name=TB>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13570|articlename=Tolkien Studies IV. 2007|dated=|website=TB|accessed=1 January 2012}}</ref>
