'''Fangorn Forest''' was a deep, dark woodland that grew beneath the southern [[Misty Mountains]], under the eastern flanks of that range. It gained notoriety as the habitat of the [[Ents]] in the [[Third Age]]. The forest, known as '''Entwood''' in [[Rohan]], was named after the oldest Ent, [[Treebeard|Fangorn]]. Fangorn Forest was the oldest part of Treebeard's realm, and here the Ents retreated. Fangorn was within the borders of [[Gondor]], but centuries passed without any [[Gondorian]] visiting it to prove or disprove the legends around it. 


==Description==
[[Legolas]] described Fangorn as "old, very old...and full of memory" <ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>, and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]] described it as "very dim, and stuffy", comparing it to the [[Old Took|Old Took's]] room in the [[Great Smials]].  [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] contrasted the forest with [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] description of the pitch-dark [[Mirkwood]], saying, "This is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish." <ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==History==
===First and Second Age===
Fangorn Forest was the easternmost survivor of the immense forest that spanned all of [[Eriador]] and [[Calenardhon]] in the [[First Age]] and early [[Second Age]], but which was destroyed by the [[Númenóreans]] and [[Sauron]]. 

===Third Age===
[[Saruman]] often used to walk in Fangorn and talk with Treebeard, if he met him, and was always eager to listen to anything the old Ent told him about the forest. However, he never repaid Treebeard in the same way. <ref name="Treebeard"/> Saruman used this knowledge of the forest's secrets for his own advantage.

Beginning in {{TA|2953}} Saruman started fortifying [[Isengard]]<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and eventually his [[Orcs]] started abusing and harassing the forest, its trees and Ents, for his fortifications and war machines.

====War of the Ring====
On [[28 February]] of {{TA|3019}}, [[Éomer]]'s [[Éored]] attacked and slaughtered the band of [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Uglúk]] under the eaves of Fangorn.<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref> This allowed [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] to escape the [[Orcs]] and pass into the forest. There they met Treebeard and informed him of the danger that [[Saruman]] posed to the Ents and their forest. Following the [[Entmoot]] the rest of the Ents finally agreed to march against [[Isengard]], taking Merry and Pippin with them and sending [[Huorns]] to [[Helm's Deep]] to deal with the [[Orcs]] there. Part of the reason was that [[Saruman]]'s Orcs had been chopping down the trees at the south and west side of the forest, which angered the Ents.

On [[1 March|March 1]], {{TA|3019}}, [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] entered the forest in search of Merry and Pippin. Rather than the two young hobbits, they encountered the White Wizard. At first they believed it to be [[Saruman]] before realising that it was [[Gandalf]], returned from death.

==Etymology==
''Fangorn'' is a [[Sindarin]] word that translates as "Treebeard" (from ''[[fang]]'' = "beard" and ''[[orn]]'' = "tree"). Entwood is a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Entwudu'' (''wudu'' "wood"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 769-70</ref>=
