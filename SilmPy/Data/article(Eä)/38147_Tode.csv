'''Tode''' was a marshy location mentioned in the [[The Shire|Shire]]-poem ''[[The Mewlips]]''.<ref>{{AB|Mewlips}}</ref>

It is mentioned to be after a long road "beyond the [[Merlock Mountains]]", and "through the [[spider]]-shadows"; other than that it is unknown if Tode refers to an actual marsh in the [[Westlands]], or if it was just an invention by the poet. 

As the poem describes a location similar to [[Mirkwood]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Mewlips, the"</ref> it's possible that Tode refers to the [[Long Marshes]] at the end of the [[Old Forest Road]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Tode", p. 386</ref>
