The '''Hill of the Slain''', or '''Haudh-en-Ndengin''' in [[Sindarin]], was a huge green mound that stood alone in the middle of the burned and ruined land of [[Anfauglith]]. It had been raised by [[Morgoth]]'s [[Orcs]] after the victory in the terrible battle of [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], and beneath it lay the bodies of the [[Elves]] and [[Edain]] slain in that battle, along with their gear and weaponry.<ref name="Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Among the many slain heroes beneath the mound was [[Huor]], the brother of [[Húrin]] and great-grandfather of [[Elrond]]. According some tales, Morgoth went there to taunt his prisoner Húrin after the Nirnaeth.<ref>{{CH|3}}, p. 63</ref> Huor's wife [[Rían]] also went to the mound seeking her lost husband. When she came to the Hill of the Slain, she laid down in grief and died.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
