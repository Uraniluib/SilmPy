The '''Wells of Varda''' were the great vats beneath the [[Two Trees]] in [[Valinor]] created by [[Varda]] to store the dew that fell from [[Laurelin]] and [[Telperion]].<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref> 

The Wells were drained by [[Ungoliant]] in the [[Darkening of Valinor]], and while drinking she grew to such a size that even [[Morgoth|Melkor]] feared her.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>
