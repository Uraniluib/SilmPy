'''Nandorin''' was the language of the [[Nandor]], those [[Teleri|Telerin]] [[Elves]] who broke from the [[Great Journey]] east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. As [[Sindarin]] became the dominant [[Elvish]] tongue of [[Middle-earth]], Nandorin became little-spoken, and by the [[Third Age]], was represented mainly in old place-names and [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] dialects developed under its influence.

The most extensive posthumously published writing (so far) by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] where he discusses the Nandorin tongue is found in the essay ''Tengwesta Qenderinwa'' (manuscript TQ 2, ca. [[1951]]-[[1952|52]]). Here, we learn that Nandorin was also called ''Danian'' (from the leader [[Lenwë|Dân]]). As a branch of the Nandor (the [[Green-elves]]) turned westward, settling in [[Ossiriand]], Nandorin was divided into ''West-Danian'' (also called ''Ossiriandrin'' or ''Ossiriandish'',<ref group="note">Tolkien also uses the form ''Ossiriandish'' in a manuscript associated with "''Words, Phrases and Passages in'' The Lord of the Rings" ([[Parma Eldalamberon 17|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 17]], p. 153)</ref> and ''Laiquenderin'') and ''East-Danian''.<ref>{{PE|18}}, p. 78</ref> 

In ''[[Lhammas|The Lhammas]]'' (ca. [[1937]]-[[1938|38]]), Tolkien used different names for these tongues. ''East Danian'' is called ''Leikvian'', and the tongue of those who settled in Ossiriand is called ''Ossiriandic'' or ''Ossiriandeb''.<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>
