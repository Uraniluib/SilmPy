{{disambig-two|the people|region also called "Forodwaith"|[[Northern Waste]]}}
The '''Forodwaith''' were an almost unknown people of [[Men]] who dwelt in the far north of [[Middle-earth]], apparently dating back to the [[Elder Days]]. They were noted as being a hardy people, as indeed would be necessary living in the icy lands close to [[Morgoth]]'s stronghold at [[Angband]]. The land they lived in was also called [[Northern Waste|Forodwaith]], after its inhabitants.

By the [[Third Age]], little was left of the Forodwaith. Their last remnant were a people known as the [[Lossoth]], who lived near the [[Icebay of Forochel]]. However, the frozen north was still referred to as Forodwaith by the people of Middle-earth.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Forodwaith means "People of the North" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[forod]]'' = "north" and ''[[gwaith]]'' = "people").
