'''Estelmo''' was the squire to [[Isildur]]'s eldest son [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]].

==History==
In {{TA|2}}, Estelmo accompanied Elendur and Isildur north along the eastern slopes of the [[Misty Mountains]]. They were [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|ambushed]] by [[Orcs]], and after a blow to the head Estelmo was believed dead. Stunned, the young man survived and was found under Elendur's body.  Estelmo recuperated, and was one of only three [[Men]] to survive the Disaster in which Isildur and [[the One Ring]] were lost.  He was able to report the words of Isildur and Elendur when they parted.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>
