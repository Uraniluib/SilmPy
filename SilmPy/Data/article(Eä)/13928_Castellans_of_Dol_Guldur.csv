{{cleanup}}{{adaptation}}The '''Castellans of [[Dol Guldur]]''' are wraiths in the service of [[Sauron]] in [[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]].
==Description==
Nameless and with no will of their own, the Castellans of Dol Guldur are but one facet of that cursed tower’s sleepless malice. Formless, save for the armor that binds them, they stalk the paths about Dol Guldur, slaying those they find. Each fell to Sauron’s service in a different way; some sought to learn from him as an apprentice does from a master, others are the eternal remnants of one who has died in agony in Sauron’s dungeons. However they came into the Dark Lord’s service, they are all now bound to his curse and serve him absolutely.
