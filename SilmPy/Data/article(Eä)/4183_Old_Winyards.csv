'''Old Winyards''' was a place in [[the Shire]]'s [[Southfarthing]]<ref name="nomen"/>, noted for its production of strong wines of the same name. 

[[Bungo Baggins]], who delved [[Bag End]], seems to have laid down a large number of bottles of "Old Winyards". His son, [[Bilbo Baggins]] gave a present of a dozen bottles to [[Rorimac Brandybuck]], [[Master of Buckland]] at the time he left the Shire,<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref> but this still left plenty for his heir [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. The Old Winyards lasted another seventeen years, until the last drop was drunk by Frodo as he set out on his own adventures.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name means "the Old Vineyards".<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 781-2</ref>

Winyard is a real-life place-name in England, and [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that it descends from [[Old English]] before the assimilation to Romance stem ''vin-''.<ref name="nomen"/>
