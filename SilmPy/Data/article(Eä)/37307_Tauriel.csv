== History ==

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', when the elves of the [[Woodland Realm]] capture [[Thorin and Company]], Tauriel takes an interest in the young dwarf [[Kíli]]. When she learns of his being struck by a poisoned arrow by [[Bolg]] in the Company's escape from custody in wine barrels, she goes after him in hopes of healing his wound. [[Legolas]] (who is shown to be protective of her) joins her in pursuit of the [[Orcs]] who were after the company. The two of them manage to reach them in [[Lake-town]] and kill many of them, while Tauriel also manages to heal Kíli with [[athelas]] found on the premises.

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', after she has succeeded in healing Kíli, the dragon [[Smaug]] attacks Lake-town. Luckily, she manages to escape the dragon's fiery  wrath. Later on, during the aftermath of Smaug's attack on Lake-town, Kíli confesses his love for her. After that, she accompanies Legolas to [[Gundabad]] to discover another Orc army heading for the [[Lonely Mountain]], as well as thousands of [[bats]]. They return in time for the [[Battle of Five Armies|Battle of the Five Armies]]. She kills many Orcs and [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]]. Nearing the end of the battle, she confronts [[Thranduil]] who ordered his troops to withdraw. Thranduil was about to kill her, probably because she threatened him and claimed that he had no love in his heart, most likely offending him, when [[Legolas]] intervened. Tauriel went off to look for the dwarf [[Kili]], attempting to save him. However, during the battle, she witnesses Kíli's death at the hands of [[Bolg]]. After the battle, she confesses her love over Kíli's body. It is unknown what happens to her after this.

==Etymology==
The name ''Tauriel'', "daughter of Mirkwood"<ref name="PJCasting"/> (or more literally, "daughter of the forest") is made from the Sindarin word ''[[taur]]'' meaning "forest", and the patronymic ending ''[[-iel]]'' which means "daughter of".
