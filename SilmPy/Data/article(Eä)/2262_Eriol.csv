'''Eriol''' (born as '''Ottor'''), the son of [[Eoh]], was born in [[wikipedia:Angeln|Angeln]], between the [[wikipedia:Flensburg Firth|Flensburg Fjord]] and the river [[wikipedia:Schlei|Schlei]].

== History ==
After his father was killed by his uncle, [[Beorn (son of Heden)|Beorn]], Eriol fled to the island of [[wikipedia:Heligoland|Heligoland]] where he married a woman named [[Cwén]]. He was the father of [[wikipedia:Hengist and Horsa|Hengest]] and [[wikipedia:Hengist and Horsa|Horsa]], who later became great chieftains of their people. His grandfather was named [[Heden]] and claimed a descent of the Norse god [[wikipedia:Odin|Wóden]] himself.

While sailing the Sea, Ottor followed the directions of an old man who turned out to be [[Ulmo]], and was cast away on [[Tol Eressëa]]. He was welcomed by the [[Elves]] there who gave him the name ''Eriol Sarothron'' ("Lone dreamer" and "Voyager"), and who also called him ''Angol'' (after the "iron cliffs" of his home). [[Lindo]] hosted him in the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] of Kortirion where they were celebrating [[Turuhalmë]].

There, he met and talked with [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], [[Eltas]], [[Gilfanon]] and others, all eager to teach him the origin of the [[Arda|World]] and tales from the [[Elder Days]]. Eriol also learned the origin of the land of [[Luthany]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
Eriol's arrival to Eressëa is the frame story of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the first conception of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]].

The story follows Ottor's exploration of the Isle and meeting with the Elves who are willing to narrate their lore about the creation of the world, the origins of the Elves, Dwarves and Men, their wars against the Enemy and the origins of [[Luthany]] (Britain); each Elf narrates another part of the history, forming what would consist ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' decades later.

Later in the story, Ottor narrates his own background and how he came to arrive to Eressëa; the Elves also tell him their prophecies concerning their return to Luthany and the rekindling of the [[Two Trees]].

The names of Ottor's sons are significant to the historical context of the Eriol story. In British folklore, Hengest and Horsa are the legendary leaders of the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain in the 5th century AD. By connecting them to the translator of the ''Lost Tales'', Tolkien would have established a direct link between his legendarium and the [[wikipedia:Matter of Britain|Matter of Britain]].

In later works of Tolkien, the figure of Eriol was renamed '''[[Ælfwine]]''' and was given a different background. Rather than a Saxon of the 5th century (predating the establishment of England), Ælfwine is revised as an Anglo-Saxon citizen of 10th century England. However, neither Eriol nor Ælfwine appear in the published ''Silmarillion''.
