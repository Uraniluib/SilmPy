'''Entwade''' was a ford that crossed the River [[Entwash]] some fifty-five miles northeast of [[Edoras]] in [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> 

On their journey north to [[the Shire]] in search of [[Baggins Family|Baggins]], the [[Nazgûl]] secretly and invisibly, on foot, had passed west through [[Anórien]], and on over the Entwade<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> before turning eastward again to return to the banks of the [[Anduin]].<ref group=note>This considerable detour suggests that the Entwade must have been the only crossing-place on the Entwash.</ref> 

After [[Éomer]] attacked the [[Orcs|Orc]]-band outside Fangorn, he was leading his Riders for this ford when he met [[Aragorn]] and his companions in the [[Eastemnet]]. He lent the horses [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]] to the [[Three Hunters]], and asked that they would follow him at some time across the Entwade to Edoras.<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref><ref group=note>Their later adventures in [[Fangorn Forest]] probably meant that they eventually came to Edoras by a different route. Cf. {{HM|AME}}, "Rauros to Dunharrow", p. 167</ref> 
==Etymology==
Entwade is a modernisation of [[Old English]] ''Entwaed'' (''waed'', "ford"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 769-70</ref>
