The '''stars''', playing a prominent role in the history of [[Arda]], were created by the Vala [[Varda]] (thus her names [[Tintallë]] = Q. Kindler, [[Elentári]] = Q. Star-queen, [[Varda|Elbereth]] = S. Star-queen).<ref>{{HM|S}}</ref>

==History==

Varda created the stars in two phases: first, in the earliest ages of the creation of [[Arda]], and second, prior to the awakening of the Elves.  She made the second group using collected light from the Silver Tree, [[Telperion]].  These were the brighter of the stars that we see.  This group included many of the prominent '''constellations''', including [[Menelmacar]] (Orion) and the [[Valacirca]] (the Sickle of the Valar, the Big Dipper).  

Also created in the second group appear to be many of what we would consider planets rather than stars. These are named [[Carnil]], [[Luinil]], [[Nénar]], [[Lumbar]], [[Alcarinquë]], and [[Elemmírë]].<ref group=note>In his introduction to the Index of ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] identifies these, respectively, with the planets Mars, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury.  Most of these identifications appear to be fairly certain, although there are astronomical problems with the identifications of Neptune and Uranus in the context of the mythology.  Note that Venus is not included on this list, as in the mythology, it is not a star (or planet), but rather a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]].</ref>

While the evil of [[Morgoth]] corrupted the whole of [[Arda]] ('[[Arda Marred]]'), the stars (or at least most of them) remained unaffected.<ref>{{ER|R2}}, p. 152</ref>

The Elves first awoke under the stars before the Sun and Moon existed, and the stars were the first thing they saw.  The earliest words spoken by the Elves are associated with the stars; according to Elvish legend, ''ele'' was a primitive exclamation 'behold!' made by the Elves when they first saw the stars.  From this origin derived the ancient words ''el'' and ''elen'', meaning 'star'."  Moreover, when [[Oromë]] first met the Elves, he too associated them with the stars and named them the [[Eldar]], the People of the Stars.  

The [[Star of Eärendil]] is a unique case.  Following his successful mission to persuade the Valar to intervene in the wars against [[Morgoth]] in the First Age, [[Eärendil]] and his ship, along with the last remaining Silmaril, were placed in the sky as a sign of hope to the faithful people of Middle-earth.  After the war against Morgoth was concluded, a group of the Edain followed Eärendil's star to the newly created island that would become Númenor.  Consequently, one of the names of that island was [[Elenna]], or "Starwards". <ref group=note>The Star of Eärendil is identified with the Evening or Morning Star, i.e. the planet Venus.</ref>

Emblems also featured stars.  An eight-rayed star represented the [[House of Fëanor]], and seven eight-rayed stars above a crown and anvil were the emblems of [[Durin]]. Both of these were depicted on the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]] (the former because [[Celebrimbor]], one of the makers of the doors, was a descendant of Fëanor).  Seven stars appeared on the banner of Gondor. Certain jewels are also described as stars, notably the [[Star of Elendil]] that Aragorn wore into the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  In the [[Lay of Nimrodel]], it is said that "A star was bound upon her brow," clearly describing some kind of jewel.

Other prominent references to stars include:
* The [[Quenya]] greeting, ''Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo'' (Quenya: "A star shines on the hour of our meeting.")
* Frodo, from the window of his room in [[Rivendell]], observed a red star foreshadowing the [[Eye of Sauron]]: "But low in the South one star shone red ... deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley."<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref><ref group=note>While recognizing its allegorical nature, scholars have attempted to identify this star in the night sky. [[David Turner]], "Stars of fancy" in ''Nova Notes'' (newsletter of the Halifax Center of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada), vol. 27, no. 2, avril 1996, identifies it with Sirius, supposedly reddish many aeons ago. [[Alain Lefèvre]], "L’astre rouge de la Lune du Chasseur" (French) in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'', vol. 2, 2014, pp. 29-41, argues against Sirius and retains Mars as possible candidate. As an aside note, "Saruman's Book" in [[Peter Jackson]]'s adaptation includes pages in [[tengwar]] (movie prop designed by [[Daniel Reeve]]) mentioning the "red star of Sauron" and its supposedly (non-[[canon|canonical]]) strange effects on nature.</ref>
* [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]'s song in [[Cirith Ungol]] concludes "...above all shadows rides the Sun, and Stars for ever dwell. I will not say the Day is done, nor bid the Stars farewell."
* Travelling through [[Mordor]], Sam saw a star, leading him to conclude that "In the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the printed text in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' it is only told that Varda set the constellations "as signs in the heavens of Arda",<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> but in "[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]" text J.R.R. Tolkien writes: 'as signs in Heaven ''that the gods may read'''.

Note that in the standard mythology of the published ''Silmarillion'', the stars of both groups were created long before the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]].  They thus contain the unsullied light of creation, and are therefore particularly sacred to the Elves.

So important was this identification of the Elves with the stars to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] that when he considered revising his creation myths so that the Sun and Moon existed from an earlier time (see ''[[Myths Transformed]]''), he still insisted that the Elves must have awoken under the stars.
