'''Anguirel''' was one of a pair of iron-cutting swords forged by [[Eöl]], the [[Dark Elf]], from an iron meteorite. Anguirel's mate was [[Anglachel]], which [[Eöl]] gave to [[Thingol]] in payment for leave to dwell in [[Nan Elmoth]].<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 97</ref>

==Fate==
Anguirel's history is far more mysterious. The only specific detail we have is that [[Eöl]] kept it for himself, but it was stolen by his son [[Maeglin]]. This must have happened when Maeglin and his mother [[Aredhel]] fled [[Nan Elmoth]] for [[Gondolin]], so presumably the sword was taken to [[Turgon]]'s hidden city. What became of it after that is unknown.

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''Anguirel'' is not as clear as that of its mate. It might mean "Iron of the Eternal Star", from ''[[ang]]'' "iron", ''[[uir]]'' "eternal" and ''[[elen|el]]'' "star".
