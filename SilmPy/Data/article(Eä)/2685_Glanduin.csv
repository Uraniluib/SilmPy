The '''Glanduin''' was a river of [[Eriador]] and a northern arm of the [[Gwathló]].

==Course==
Beginning in the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]] south of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], it flowed west-north-west until it was met by the [[Sirannon]] near the old location of [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the capital of the [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]]. From there the Glanduin flowed westward towards the [[Mitheithel]], which it met in the [[Swanfleet]] marshes (''Nîn-in-Eilph'') north-east of [[Tharbad]]. There was an old ford across the Glanduin east of the falls that dropped down into the marshy lowlands.<ref name="Partings">{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

Beyond their joining both rivers became the Gwathló.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[Second Age]] the Glanduin formed the southern boundary of Eregion. In the [[Third Age]] it was part of the southern boundary of [[Arnor]].<ref name="Galadriel">{{UT|6d}}</ref>

The old ford was used by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and the other travellers journeying north after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Partings"/>

==Etymology==
Glanduin is [[Sindarin]], and means "Border-river".<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref>

==Note==
The name "Glanduin" applied to the whole river during the time of Eregion and Arnor. However, by the time of the War of the Ring, it only applied to the swift upper course of the river, and usually it was referred to as the Swanfleet river (not River), simply meaning the river that flowed into the [[Swanfleet|Nîn-in-Eilph]].<ref name="Galadriel"/>

In an annotation to [[Pauline Baynes]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] clarified that R. Glanduin should be placed near mountains, and that the name should refer to the upper part; the lower part should be named Swanfleet.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=24 March 2018}}</ref>
