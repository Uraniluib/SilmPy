The '''Front Gate''' was a common term for the '''Gate of Erebor''', the wide arched main entrance of the Dwarf-realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. The [[Great Chamber of Thrór]] was near the Gate.

The entrance was at the head of the valley formed by the two southern ridges of rock thrust out from the southern slopes of Erebor.<ref>{{H|Thror}}</ref> Out of the gateway sprang the stream that grew into the [[River Running]].<ref name=home>{{H|Home}}</ref>

Through the gate passed a stone-paved road, wide enough for many men abreast.  The gate itself was a tall arch and at one time displayed carven work, but during [[Smaug]]'s residence in the mountain the opening had become worn, splintered, and blackened.  From the gate one could look out upon [[Dale]] (or its ruins during the time of the dragon).<ref name=home/>

==History==
In {{TA|2770}} Smaug descend upon Erebor and entered the Mountain via the Front Gate, which unfortunately was wide enough to accommodate him.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Over time Smaug had broken and blocked all of the other gates to the Mountain (except for the secret [[Back Door]]), leaving only the Front Gate for his use.<ref name="Gather">{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941}} Smaug was slain.<ref name="TA"/>  [[Thorin]] and company, having entered the Mountain through the [[Back Door]], came out the Front Gate not knowing the fate of the dragon.  When the dwarves learned of Smaug's death they returned to the Mountain and built a high thick wall of squared stones across the gate.<ref name="Gather"/>  This barrier allowed them to hold off the forces of the [[Woodland Realm]] and the [[Lake-men]] while Thorin awaited the coming of [[Dáin Ironfoot]].  However, hard upon Dáin's arrival the goblins of [[Bolg]] also appeared and the [[Battle of Five Armies]] began.  In the middle of the battle Thorin and his companion dwarves levered the wall at the Front Gate to fall outwards and they then rushed into the battle.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>  After the battle was over it was at the Front Gate that Bilbo took his leave of the surviving dwarves before heading home.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref> 

[[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] was less fortunate: he fell in battle during the [[War of the Ring]] at the threshold of the Gate, but it protected his people in the short and unsuccessful siege that followed.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
