__NOTOC__
'''WIN''' is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "young".<ref name=VT47>{{VT|47a}}, p. 26 (roots appearing as "√''win''-" and "''wini''")</ref>

==Derivatives==

*[[Quenya]]: ''[[vinya]]''; ''[[víne]]'' ("youth")<ref name=VT47/>

==Other versions==

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] appears the deleted root GWIN ("new, fresh"), with the derivatives Quenya ''[[vinya|winya]]'' ("new, fresh, young"), [[Noldorin]] ''bîn''. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] also experimented with a derivative ?[[Avarin]] ''[[Gwinarn]]''. The root GWIN was linked to [[GWEN]].<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 16</ref>

In a manuscript associated with the essay ''Eldarin Hands, Fingers & Numerals'' appears another deleted stem: WINI ("little"), perhaps intending to explain Quenya ''wine'', ''winimo'' ("baby").<ref name=VT47/>
