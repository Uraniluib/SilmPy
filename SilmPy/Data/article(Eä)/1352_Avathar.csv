'''Avathar''' or '''Avaþar''' ([[Vanyarin]] [[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈaβaθar]}}) was the land in the south-eastern part of [[Aman]], south of [[Valinor]]. It formed a dark strip of land at the feet of the [[Pelóri]] Mountains. It seems to have been totally deserted and forgotten and in ancient times [[Ungoliant]] made her home there.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In "The Later [[Quenta Silmarillion]]" section of ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] translates Avathar as "The Shadows" in "ancient" [[Quenya]];<ref>{{MR|P3II7}}, p. 284</ref> this translation also appears in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Avathar''</ref>

However, in the "[[Quendi and Eldar]]", Tolkien states that Avathar has no [[Elvish]] translation, meaning that it must have been adapted from its [[Valarin]] name<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 404</ref> (however, in the Index to that book it still says "The Shadows" in a short description<ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref>).
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', <!-- an in-line quote to specific chapters. -->the region where Ungoliant dwelt prior to the Darkening of Valinor was called ''Arvalin''.<ref>{{GA|105}}</ref>
