==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When "[[The Wanderings of HÃºrin]]" was being written there were different manuscripts with many name changes.  In the earlier version, Enthor was the younger brother of [[Hunthor]] and [[Manthor]], and he was the captain of the guards near [[Brithiach]] whom [[Asgon]] met.  In the last manuscript captain "Enthor" was replaced by "[[Ebor]]" who was "a chief henchman of Manthor's" and the words "younger brother of Hunthor and Manthor" were intended to be cut out, per [[Christopher Tolkien]].<ref name="Enthor"/>  The newly named Ebor referred to Manthor as his lord rather than his brother, strengthening Christopher's suggestion.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 263</ref>
