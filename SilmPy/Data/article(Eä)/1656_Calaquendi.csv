'''Calaquendi''' (the "'''Elves of the Light'''" or "'''Light-elves'''"), referred to those [[Elves]] who had seen the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] in [[Valinor]]. This group was also often called the '''High Elves'''.
==History==

The Calaquendi included the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]], and those [[Teleri]] who passed over [[Belegaer]], as well as the [[Sindar]]in King [[Thingol]] (alone of all his people). Another name for them was the [[Amanyar]] (with the exception of Thingol, who was not counted among them), "Those of Aman". Those kindreds who settled in [[Aman]] or descended from them were also referred to as '''High Elves''', or '''Tareldar'''<ref>{{HM|PM}}, pp. 349, 360</ref> in the lore of the [[Dúnedain]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

Those of the Elves who refused the summons of the [[Valar]] or did not complete the [[Great Journey]] to [[Valinor]] were called the ''Úmanyar'', meaning "Not of Aman" and "[[Moriquendi]]", or Dark Elves (those who had not seen the light). King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] held the unique status of being both among the Calaquendi and the Úmanyar, since he originally saw the Light, being one of the three ambassadors brought to Aman by [[Oromë]], but did not return to Aman during the [[Great Journey]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Calaquendi'' consists of [[Quenya]] ''[[cala]]'' ("light"), and ''[[quendi]]'' ("elves"); thus: "Elves of Light".

Cognates of the name ''Calaquendi'' in other languages are [[Telerin]] ''[[Calapendi]]'' and [[Sindarin]] ''[[Calben|Calbin]]''.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==

In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', '''Light-elves''' was a name given to the [[Vanyar]].<ref name=H8>{{H|8}}</ref> This term was used just once in this application, and never again in any [[Canon|canonical]] source.<ref group=note>The other two groups of Elves mentioned in this part of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' were the "[[Noldor|Deep-elves]]" (referring to the [[Noldor]]) and the "[[Falmari|Sea-elves]]" (referring to the [[Falmari]]).</ref>

==Inspiration==

In Norse mythology, there are the Light Elves (''[[Wikipedia:Light elves|Ljósálfar]]'') and the [[Moriquendi|Dark Elves]] (''Dökkálfar'' or ''[[Wikipedia:Svartálfar|Svartálfar]]''), a tradition which was well known to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>{{HM|SG}}, "Appendix A: Origins of the Legend", p. 359</ref>
