'''Mount Taras''' was a tall mountain at the western end of a line of hills that were outliers of the [[Ered Wethrin]].  It towered over a green cape between [[Nevrast]] and [[West Beleriand]] on the shores of [[Belegaer]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  Below its slopes [[Turgon]] built his halls of [[Vinyamar]] when he first returned to [[Middle-earth]]. Long after Turgon had deserted Nevrast for [[Gondolin]], [[Tuor]] came there and spoke with [[Ulmo]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
