'''Ruling Steward''' was the title used for the rulers of [[Gondor]] after the loss of its King.

The [[Stewards of Gondor]] were only the advisors to the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]. The first Ruling Steward was [[Pelendur]] who ruled briefly after the death of King [[Ondoher]] and his sons ({{TA|1944}}). 

[[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]] was the one who started ruling Gondor after the death of its last King [[Earnur]]. The Ruling Stewards ruled on the behalf of the King until the throne would be claimed by one of the Royal House. The office was in all respects and purposes that of the King, although out of respect the Steward never sat on the throne of the King; instead, they sat on a simple chair of black stone placed below it. The symbol of their office was a white rod. 

The title was hereditary, and was carried on through twenty-six generations to [[Denethor|Denethor II]], Ruling Steward at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. His son [[Faramir]] gave up the rule of Gondor to [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], the rightful [[Heir of Isildur]]. Faramir then took up the traditional role of a Steward of Gondor as the advisor to the King.
