'''Enderi''' were the 'middle-days' common to the [[Elves|Elven]] and the [[Númenórean]] calendars, and were counted outside the months.

In the [[Reckoning of Rivendell]], three ''enderi'' were set between the seasons of [[Yávië]] and [[Quellë]]. Every twelfth year (except in every 432nd year), these ''enderi'' were doubled to six.<ref name="D">{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

In the [[Kings' Reckoning]] and [[Stewards' Reckoning]], there was only one ''enderë''; the day of the [[Mid-year's Day|middle of the year]] between the ''[[astar]]'' of [[Nárië]] and [[Cermië]] was called ''[[loëndë]]''. In leap years (divisible by 4 but not 100) it was replaced by two ''enderi''<ref name="D" />; in years divisible by 1000 loëndë was replaced by three enderi{{fact}}.

In the [[New Reckoning]] each year contained three ''enderi'', between [[Yavannie]] and [[Narquelie]]; the middle of the three was referred to as ''loëndë''.<ref name="D" />
