'''Adalgar Oldbank''' was a [[Bree-hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Bree]] in ''[[the Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''.

He owns a shop near the [[Prancing Pony]] and sells potions and arrows. Unlike many other [[Bree-landers]], he is friendly to [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] because they are the only sources of news in Bree. He is, however, unaware of the protection of the Rangers against the dangers of [[Eriador]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'', ''Prologue''</ref>
