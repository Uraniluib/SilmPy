The '''Men of Bree''' were [[Bree-landers]], specifically the [[Men]] who lived around the [[Bree-land]], especially the village of [[Bree]].
==Origins==
Their own tales acknowledged that their ancestors were the first Men who wandered to the [[West]].<ref name=sign/> The Men of Bree trace their origins from the race of the [[Pre-Númenóreans]] who inhabited the northern [[White Mountains]] during the [[Second Age]], in the land that would be later known as [[Calenardhon]]. As such they were related to the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]] and the [[Dunlendings]]. 

During the [[Dark Years]], some of this folk, migrated northward to the dales south of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Eventually they continued to the [[Barrow-downs]] before settling the region around the tall, wooded [[Bree-hill]].<ref name=Men>{{App|Men}}</ref> 

==History==

According to their own tales, the Bree-men were there since the [[Elder Days]], they survived the turmoils, they were still there when the [[Númenóreans]] came, and would remain for the following millennia.<ref name=sign/>

When the Kingdom of [[Arnor]] was founded, Bree-land lay inside its borders, and on the road that led to [[Gondor]]; as such the Men of Bree became subject of Arnor, and adopted [[Westron]].<ref name=Men/> Around the Bree-hill, the Men of Bree established the settlement of [[Bree]], [[Staddle]], [[Archet]] and [[Combe]].

In about {{TA|1300}}, their land was visited by the [[Halflings]] who were fleeing the encroaching darkness to the east.<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref> They formed a unique society in all [[Middle-earth]] where Men and Hobbits lived beside on another. Thus they were affectionally called the "Big Folk" and the "Little Folk".<ref name=sign>{{FR|Sign}}</ref> 

The Men of Bree endured the [[Battle of Fornost|Fall of Arnor]] ({{TA|1975}}) and continued living independently, like before its existence.<ref name=sign/>

During the [[War of the Ring]] some Men of Bree like [[Bill Ferny]] and [[Harry Goatleaf]] were spies of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] and later they joined [[Saruman]]'s [[ruffians]].<ref name=sign/><ref>{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

==Culture==
In appearance, these [[Men]] were in stature  short and broad, and often brown-haired. They were cheerful and provincial. In contrast to other Men, those of Bree were friendly to the other races, Hobbits, [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]].<ref name=sign/>

They seem to have maintained a curious tradition of taking their names from plants and herbs; families of the Men of Bree included [[Appledore Family|Appledore]], [[Ferny Family|Ferny]], [[Goatleaf Family|Goatleaf]], [[Heathertoes Family|Heathertoes]], [[Rushlight Family|Rushlight]], [[Thistlewool Family|Thistlewool]] and [[Butterbur Family|Butterbur]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p.208</ref>
