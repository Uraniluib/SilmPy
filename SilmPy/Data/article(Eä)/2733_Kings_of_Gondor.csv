Elendil was the first King of [[Arnor]] and was succeeded by Isildur.  Elendil ruled over both realms as High King of the Dúnedain-in-exile Isildur succeeded as High King as well upon his father's death.  Isildur committed Gondor to the rule of Meneldil the son of Anarion as sole King of Gondor, but Isildur's royalty in the South-realm remained, as his line was by right High King over both [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], though after Isildur's death, the realms were split. Isildur's heirs ruled Arnor and Anárion's heirs ruled Gondor.

Eärnur was taken in [[Minas Morgul]] and never seen again, and the Kingdom of Gondor was ruled by a succession of [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] until the restoration of the line of Kings with Elessar ([[Aragorn]]), the first king of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of Gondor and Arnor.

The Kings were buried in the [[Hallows]] of Minas Tirith. Stone statues of the Kings were in the [[Tower Hall]].
