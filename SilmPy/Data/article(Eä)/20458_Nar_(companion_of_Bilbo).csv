'''Nar''' was one of the four Dwarves that accompanied [[Bilbo Baggins]] on his journeys after his birthday party.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>
==Other versions==
In the early writings of the chapter "[[A Long-expected Party]]", Nar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.{{fact}}
