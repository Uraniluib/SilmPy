'''Menel''' was an [[Elvish]] (both [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]) name for the regions of air above [[Arda]], a name which is generally meant as "firmament, heaven" or "the heavens".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''menel''</ref> Sometimes the word is simply synonymous with the sky, but in other uses it is meant as a more sublime reference to the domain of the stars and heavenly bodies. 

Menel is a physical place, although arguably a sacred one as it is the location of the stars.
==Etymology==
The word is understood as ''[[men (Elvish)|men]]'' "towards" + ''[[el]]'' "star" meaning "the Direction of the Stars".<ref name="RGEO">{{RGEO|7}}, p. 72</ref>

The loremaster [[Quennar]] is attributed as having devised the word ''Menel'' ("heavens, firmament").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 84</ref>

==Examples==
Menel is seen in numerous personal and place-names, including [[Meneltarma]] (the "Pillar of Heaven"), [[Meneldil]], [[Tar-Meneldur]], [[Armenelos]] and [[Meneldor]].  

It also appears in ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]'' "''[[o]] [[menel]] [[aglar]] [[elen]][[-ath|ath]]''" ("from the glories of the star-host of heaven").<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] used it in his invocation from [[Cirith Ungol]]: "''o menel [[palan]]-[[tir|diriel]]''" ("from heaven gazing afar").<ref>{{TT|IV10}}</ref>
