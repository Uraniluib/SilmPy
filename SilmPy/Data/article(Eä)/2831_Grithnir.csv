'''Grithnir''' was a servant of the [[House of Hador]]. In the prime of his life, in the time of [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]], Grithnir was said to have travelled widely in [[Beleriand]], and come to know its ways well. For this reason, in his old age, he was selected by [[Morwen]] as one on the two guides to travel to [[Doriath]] with her son [[Túrin]]. They were successful, and Túrin was taken into King [[Thingol]]'s court, but unlike his companion [[Gethron]], Grithnir never saw his northern homelands again. He became sick while a guest in [[Menegroth]], and died before he could make the journey home.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>
