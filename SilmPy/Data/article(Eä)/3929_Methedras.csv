'''Methedras''' ([[Sindarin]] for "Last Peak") was the southernmost peak of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> Upon its eastern slopes sprang the [[Entwash]] River, which flowed into the western edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], growing about the base of the mountain.<ref name="Treebeard"/>
 
To the south, Methedras stood above [[Isengard]] in the valley of [[Nan Curun√≠r]].  The sources of the [[Isen]] River were upon the mountain.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>  On [[3 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the [[Ents]] diverted the waters of the Isen to flow into Isengard, flooding its pits and creating a lake about the tower.<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the draft version of "[[The Riders of Rohan]]", ''Methedras'' was named ''Methen Amon''.  This name would be changed to ''Methendol'' before the final name of ''Methedras'' was adopted.<ref>{{TI|XX}}, note 18</ref>
