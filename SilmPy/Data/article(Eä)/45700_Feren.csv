'''Feren''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[Woodland Realm]] who appears in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' film series]]. He was played by [[Simon London]]. When it is discovered that [[Thorin and Company]] have escaped from their prison cells via wine barrels, Feren blows a horn to alert the Elves guarding the gate that leads to the [[River Running]], also ordering them to close the gate so as to bring the [[Dwarves]] back into custody.

Later, Feren is sent by [[Thranduil]] to where the [[Lake-town]] refugees are staying to summon [[Legolas]] back to [[Mirkwood]], and to also inform [[Tauriel]] that the elven-king has banished her from the realm. He also serves as one of Thranduil's chief lieutenants in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].
