In an earlier version of the [[legendarium]] '''Arlisgion''' or the '''Place of Reeds''' were names for the fenland region later known as '''[[Lisgardh]]'''.

In ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' it is described as being located to the south of [[Dor-lómin|Dor Lómin]] but separated from it by the [[Iron Mountains]]. [[Tuor]] stayed there for a while before departing for the "yet more lovely" [[Nan-tathren|Land of Willows]].
