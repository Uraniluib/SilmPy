A '''white cow''' belonged to the [[Fairies]] dwelling in [[Artanor]], according to an [[Elves|Elvish]] poem. Although nothing else is known about this creature, possibly the cow itself was a FaÃ«rie creature.<ref name=PE18>{{PE|18}}, p. 142</ref>

==Inspiration==
As noted by [[Arden R. Smith]], "''nothing about a white cow in Artanor or [[Doriath]] appears elsewhere in the published [[legendarium]], but white cows as denizens of the fairy world are a common motif in Celtic mythology.''"<ref name=PE18/><ref>For more on white cows as fairy creatures, cf. James MacKillop, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=U-O0wzFcu2gC&pg=PA108&dq=White+cow+fairy+celtic+mythology&hl=en&ei=XDbqTJ_nC4roOeTawdwK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=White%20cow%20fairy%20celtic%20mythology&f=false Oxford Dictionary of Celic Mythology]'', p. 108</ref>
