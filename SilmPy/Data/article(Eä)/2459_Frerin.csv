'''Frerin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2751|n}} – {{TA|2799|n}}, aged 48 years) was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of the royal line of [[Durin's folk]].  The second son of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]]. His older brother was the Dwarven hero and future king [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]], and his younger sister was [[Dís]]. 

==History==
With the rest of his family he was driven into exile from the [[Lonely Mountain]] when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|attacked]] their home. He later took part in the bloody [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], even though he was still very young at the time. 

In the final conflict of the war, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], he was in the first assault of the vanguard that was led by his father, which was thrown back with loss. Frerin and the rest of the vanguard were driven into a wood of great trees near lake [[Mirrormere]]. It was there Frerin met his end, along with his kinsman [[Fundin]], and many others.

After the battle, the Dwarves that were left built pyres, and burned the bodies of the their dead, Frerin being among them.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==

[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Frerin'' may derive from either the [[Old Norse]] Dwarf-name ''Frár'' ("Swift") in the ''[[Völuspá]]'', or from Old Norse ''frérinn'' ("frozen").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 225</ref>
