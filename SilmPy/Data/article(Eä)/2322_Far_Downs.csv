The '''Far Downs''' were the downlands that marked the former western borders of [[the Shire]], forty leagues (120 miles) west from the [[Brandywine Bridge]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Of their geography almost nothing is known, except that the town of [[Greenholm]] seems to have been built among the Downs. 

King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] extended the Shire's borders westward to the [[Tower Hills]] in {{SR|1452}}, with the [[Westmarch]] laying in-between. [[Fastred of Greenholm]] became the first [[Warden of Westmarch]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

==Note==
In [[Ballantine Books]]' paperback edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' there was a misprint in the [[The Lord of the Rings Prologue|Prologue]] that incorrectly named the Far Downs as the "Fox Downs".<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>
