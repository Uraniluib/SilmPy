__NOTOC__
'''Tarmenel''' was a term that clearly translates as "high heaven", though as it only appears in one of [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s rhymes, it is hard to be sure exactly what the term referred to. In [[Elves|Elvish]] cosmology, the world was enfolded in different layers of airs, and it seems that Tarmenel was a term for the highest or outermost of these - the "[[Over-heaven]]".{{fact}}
