'''Realms in Exile''' also known as the '''Kingdoms of the [[Dúnedain]]''' was the collective name for [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], the North-Kingdom and South-kingdom of the [[Dúnedain]] in the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]]. Both Kingdoms were founded in {{SA|3320}}<ref>{{App|SA}}, 3320</ref> by [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] [[Elendil]], and his sons who ruled [[Ithilien]] and [[Anórien]]. 

[[Arnor]] occupied a central part of [[Eriador]] until it vanished during the [[Third Age]] (divided in {{TA|861}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, 861</ref> and destroyed in {{TA|1974|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, 1974</ref>) but at the end of that Age, the expanse of both kingdoms formed the [[Reunited Kingdom]] under [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].
