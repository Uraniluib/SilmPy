'''Trolls''' were large monsters of limited intellect.  They were strong and vicious, but they could not endure sunlight. 
==History==
[[Morgoth]] created Trolls at the end of the [[First Age]] (twilight of the [[Elder Days]]).<ref name=one>{{App|F1iv}}</ref> Their exact origins are unknown, though it is stated by [[Treebeard|Treebeard]] that Trolls were "made in mockery of" [[Ents]], similar to the way that [[Orcs]] were a twisted parody of the [[Elves]].

Many Trolls died in the [[War of Wrath]], but some survived and joined the forces of [[Sauron]], the greatest surviving servant of Morgoth. In the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]], Trolls were among Sauron's most dangerous warriors and breeds of the various kinds of Trolls could be seen in several conflicts.

In the Third Age, Sauron created the ''[[Olog-hai]]'', which were more powerful than earlier breeds of Trolls. While most Trolls cannot bear exposure to sunlight without turning to stone, the Olog-hai apparently could, something that made them particularly dangerous.

==Kinds of Trolls==

* [[Cave-trolls]]
* [[Hill-trolls]]
* [[Mountain-trolls]]
* [[Olog-hai]]
* [[Snow-trolls]]
* [[Stone-trolls]]
* [[Half-trolls]]
*Some trolls are said to have more than one head, perhaps only in legend.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>
==Names==

The [[Sindarin]] word for a "troll" is ''[[torog]]''.<ref name=one/> The [[Black Speech]] equivalent is ''[[olog]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 136</ref>

The name ''[[Rhudaur]]'' is translated by Tolkien as "Troll shaw", with ''[[rhû]]'' translated as "evil, wicked".<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 115, 170</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In an early chart of different creatures, trolls are given the [[Qenya]] name ''maulir''. [[Patrick H. Wynne]] and [[Christopher Gilson]] have suggested that ''maulir'' is posibly related to Qenya ''maule'' ("crying, weeping"), thus perhaps "referring to cries made by these monsters or to the weeping of their victims".<ref>{{PE|14}}, pp. 7, 9</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[Wikipedia:Trolls|Trolls]] were originally a part of the [[Wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]] (as a negative synonym for ''jötunn'', "[[giants]]") and [[Wikipedia:Scandinavian folklore|Scandinavian folklore]] (as ugly, large creatures of remote wildlife areas).

==Other fiction==

In ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' are mentioned the "wood-trolls" (translated by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] from the [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (disambiguation)|manuscript]] word ''wodwos'').<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 555</ref>

===Films===
'''[[1966]]: [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1966 film)]]:'''
:The three Trolls' position in the narrative was taken by two creatures called "Groans".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Gene Deitch]]|articleurl=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits/40-william-l-snyder/#comment-5311|articlename=Comment 5311|dated=25-July-2012|website=[http://genedeitchcredits.com/ genedeitchcredits]|accessed=17-October-2012}}</ref> They had wooden, bark-like skin, and, instead of stone, turned into dead trees when exposed to sunlight.

'''[[1978]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Troll that attempts to enter Balin's Tomb is depicted as a shadowy creature with dark green fur. Unlike in the novel, its feet have toes. It is the only Troll seen in the film.

===Games===
'''[[2011]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Compared to other enemies, Trolls are much stronger. Trolls first appear in [[Fornost]], where one traps [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer Wards''</ref> Another troll appears at the end of the level, where Eradan, Andriel and Farin have to protect [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]]. When this Troll is killed, the player is able to enter the Citadel to confront [[Tharzog]] and [[Agandaûr]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref>
'''[[2014]]: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''
:The Udûn and Sea of Nûrnen regions of Mordor are inhabited by large troll-like creatures known as "Olog Graugs". According to their Nature article in the Appendices menu, Sauron intends to use the Graug to crossbreed with ordinary Trolls, and create a new breed of "hill-trolls" that can withstand direct sunlight. Graugs are very rare in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game due to technical limitations, but are more abundant in the PS4, PC, and Xbox One versions.
