'''''inbar''''' "a horn"<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|35}} is an element in the [[Khuzdul]] name ''[[Caradhras|Barazinbar]]''.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the [[Sundocarmë|Root]] N-B-R,<ref name="PE17" /> which was mistyped as [[Sundocarmë|Root]] M-B-R<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 174</ref> in [[The Treason of Isengard]].<ref>[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish] by [[Magnus Åberg]]</ref>

Magnus Åberg speculated that the actual word might be *''nibar'' or *''mibar'' since words of three radical vowels such this don't begin with a vowel, but the form given in [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|PE17]] is merely ''inbar''.<ref name="PE17" /> The currently-unpublished notes on Khuzdul phonology and root modifications may shed light on this matter.<ref>{{webcite|author=Carl Hostetter|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=161449|articlename=reply to: Khuzdul - mostly to Aelfwine/Carl Hostetter|dated=26 Nov 2004|website=Plaza|accessed=17 Apr 2017}}</ref>
