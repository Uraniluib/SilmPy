'''Tar-Súrion''' was the ninth [[King of Númenor]]. He was the third child of [[Tar-Anárion]]. 

==History==
Though each of his elder sisters had a claim on the [[Sceptre of Númenor|Sceptre]] ahead of Súrion, their fear of the old Queen, their grandmother, [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queen]] [[Tar-Ancalimë]], meant that each of them refused to become their father's Heir, and so the [[King of Númenor|Kingship of Númenor]] passed eventually to Tar-Súrion.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

The history of [[Tar-Súrion]]'s 162 years reigning years was fated to be dominated by the female side of the royal line. Not only was his inheritance due to the actions of his grandmother and elder sisters, but his own eldest child was a daughter, who would reign in her own right as [[Tar-Telperiën]], Númenor's second Ruling Queen after he gave up the Sceptre at the age of 382 years.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Súrion</ref>
