'''Nísimaldar''' was the country around the haven of [[Eldalondë]] on [[Númenor|Númenor's]] western coast.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> It was the only place in Númenor where [[mallorn]] trees grew brought by [[Tol Eressëa]], and it was from the stock of these that the [[Golden Wood]] of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] came. Many other trees grew in this land, all of them gifts from the Eldar.<ref name="Numenor">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name means '[[Fragrant Trees]]', and it was so called because of the great variety of rare and beautiful [[trees]] that grew there.<ref name="Numenor"/>
