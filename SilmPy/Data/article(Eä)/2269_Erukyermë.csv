The '''''Erukyermë''''' was one of the [[Three Prayers]] held on the summit of the [[Meneltarma]] in [[Númenor]] (the others being the ''[[Erulaitalë]]'' and the ''[[Eruhantalë]]''). The ''Erukyermë'' was held at the beginning of each spring. The ruling [[King of Númenor|King]] or [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queen]], followed by a silent crowd, would climb the mountain on foot, and at its peak utter a prayer for the approaching year. Traditionally, three [[Eagles]], known by the [[Númenóreans]] as the [[Witnesses of Manwë]], would hover over the King and his people at this time.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

It was just after the ''Erukyermë'' of {{SA|883}} that [[Tar-Meneldur]], the sixth King of Númenor, surrendered the [[Sceptre]] to his son [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]].<ref name=Ald>{{UT|Aldarion}} (note 16)</ref>

Since Erukyermë marked the beginning of a new year, this points to the existence of a separate calendar for religious purposes, beginning at vernal equinox. For civil matters the [[Edain]] started the year in the middle of winter, just after ''[[Yule]]'', a tradition attested as far back as the [[First Age]].{{fact}}
==Etymology==
''Erukyermë'' means "Prayer to Eru" in [[Quenya]] (cf. ''[[kyermë]]'').<ref name=Ald/>

A misreading of ''hy'' has been suggested, but the text is a typescript.<ref>"A typescript made to this point was completed in January 1965." from {{HM|UT}}, Introduction</ref>
