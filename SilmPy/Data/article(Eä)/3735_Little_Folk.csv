'''Little Folk''' was a term for the [[Hobbits]], especially the '''[[Bree-hobbits]]''' (q.v.), contrasting them to the [[Men of Bree|Men]] (the [[Big Folk]]) as the two races live together in [[Bree-land]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>  

At other points, [[Boromir]]<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref><ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref> and [[Celeborn]]<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> referred to the Hobbits of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as "little folk". [[Treebeard]]<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> and [[Sharkey]]'s [[Ruffians]]<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> also referred to the [[Halflings]] in general as such, and thus it may be assumed that the term was in common use.
