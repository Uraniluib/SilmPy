The '''Land of the Sun''', also known as the '''Burnt Land of the Sun''', '''Easterness''', '''Eastland''',<ref name=A5>{{SM|A5}}</ref> and '''Eastern Land''',<ref name=5b>{{SM|5b}}</ref> was a continent in the far east of [[Arda]] that corresponded symmetrically to [[Aman]] in the far west. The land was separated from [[Middle-earth]] by the waters of the [[East Sea]]. In the Land of the Sun was a great, curve-shaped mountain range called the [[Walls of the Sun]].<ref name=5b/>

The Land of the Sun likely comprised all or part of the [[Empty Lands]] that [[Ilúvatar]] "cast back" during the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref name=LR>{{LR|P1II4}}, p. 32 ("If this region [the Empty Lands] ... is to be related to Ambarkanta Map V it must be what is there called the ''Burnt Land of the Sun''; perhaps also ''the [[Dark Land]]''[.]")</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the easternmost land of Arda was called '''''[[Oronto]]''''' ("East")<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>. This region was connected to the [[Great Lands]], laying directly east of [[Palisor]], with no separating water. The huge peak [[Kalormë]] stood in Oronto.<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|IX}}</ref>

[[Oromë]] described the East to the [[Valar]], saying that "''there is a silent beach and dark empty seas''". It is also told that [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]] "''builded great havens'' [of the Sun and Moon] ''beside the soundless sea''".<ref name=LT1/><ref>{{SM|5e}}</ref>
