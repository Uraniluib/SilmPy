'''Amon Lhaw''', also called the '''Hill of Hearing''', was one of the three peaks above the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]] where they drained [[Nen Hithoel]].  It towered among the [[Emyn Muil]] on the eastern banks of the [[Anduin]]. Its twin, [[Amon Hen]] (The Hill of Sight) lay upon the western bank.  Between them, at the very center of the stream above [[Rauros]], was the island hill of [[Tol Brandir]] upon which none had ever set foot.<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref>

Though at one time Amon Lhaw had been part of the northern borderlands of [[Gondor]] and a high seat was built there (probably called the [[Seat of Hearing]]) that lay centuries in the past at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]; by then, it had long since fallen under the influence of [[Mordor]].

When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] left the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] they paddled across the [[Anduin]] and landed upon the southern slopes of the hill where there was a shelving shore. <ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Amon Lhaw is [[Sindarin]], and translates as "Hill of Hearing" from ''[[amon]]'' "hill" + ''[[lhaw]]'' "ears".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 62</ref>
