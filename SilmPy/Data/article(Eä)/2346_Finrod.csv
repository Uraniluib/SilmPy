'''Finrod''' was an Elven king of the [[Noldor]], eldest son of [[Finarfin]], brother to [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]] and [[Galadriel]]. Finrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in his noble and generous heart. 

In [[Beleriand]] Finrod became the ruler of [[Nargothrond]]. He was a wise, just and powerful Elf, and a great traveller.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 144</ref>
== History ==
Finrod was born in [[Eldamar]]. He was friends with [[Turgon]] son of [[Fingolfin]], and his beloved was [[Amarië]] of the [[Vanyar]].

Finrod was among those who opposed [[Fëanor]] and the Oath. However when the Noldor were set to depart from [[Aman]], he also joined them, for he would not be sundered from his friends and his people who were eager to go. Also, Finrod had no wish to abandon his people to Fëanor's rule.
 
=== The Return of the Noldor ===
Finrod along with his father led the rear of the host along with many of the noblest and wisest of the Noldor; and often they looked behind them to see their fair city, especially Finrod for he had to leave Amarië behind. With him, he brought along many treasures from [[Tirion]],<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref> including [[Ring of Barahir|his Ring]] which bore the emblem of the [[House of Finarfin]].<ref name=beren>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Finrod and his people did not participate in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. While they were travelling up the coast of [[Araman]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Mandos]] appeared and pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], and in that hour Finarfin forsook the march and returned to [[Valinor]] with many of his people. But Finrod and his siblings went forward still and led their people on the long and perilous march to [[Middle-earth]].

=== Life in Beleriand ===
After their victory in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], the Noldor started building their numerous realms. Finrod established the tower of [[Minas Tirith in Beleriand|Minas Tirith]] on the island of [[Tol Sirion]]. Once while journeying southward along the river [[Sirion]], Finrod and his friend [[Turgon]] encamped upon its banks. And [[Ulmo]] coming up the river laid a deep sleep upon them and heavy dreams; and it seemed to each that he was bidden to prepare for a day of evil, and to establish a retreat, lest [[Morgoth]] should burst from [[Angband]] and overthrow the armies of the North.

Now on a time Finrod and his sister [[Galadriel]] were guests of King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] their kinsman in [[Doriath]]. There Finrod told Thingol of his admiration for the halls of [[Menegroth]]; and Thingol spoke to him of the deep gorge of the river [[Narog]]. Thingol told him about the caves under the [[High Faroth]] in its deep western shore. Thus Finrod came to the [[Caverns of Narog]] and established there deep halls and armouries; and that stronghold was called [[Nargothrond]]. In this he was aided by the [[Dwarves]] of the [[Blue Mountains]], and Finrod rewarded them with many jewels from Valinor. And in that time was made for him the [[Nauglamír]], the Necklace of the Dwarves. After Nargothrond was made, Finrod committed Minas Tirith to the keeping of [[Orodreth]] his nephew, and was referred to by the additional name of Felagund, an honorific title given him by the Dwarves, meaning a "Maker of Caves".

The realm of Nargothrond extended to the sea, excluding the [[Falas]]. Finrod was friend and ally of [[Cirdan]], and had also built the tower [[Barad Nimras]] upon the cape.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

=== Encounter with Men ===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Felagund Among Bëor’s Men.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Felagund Among Bëor’s Men'']]
When three hundred years and more had passed since the Noldor came to Beleriand,  Finrod Felagund lord of Nargothrond journeyed east of Sirion and went hunting with [[Maglor]] and [[Maedhros]] sons of Feanor. But he wearied of the hunt and passed on alone towards the mountains of [[Ered Lindon]]. There in the lands of [[Thargelion]] in [[East Beleriand]] Finrod was first of the Noldor to come across [[Men]]. These were the kindred and followers of [[Bëor]] [[The Old]]. He went among them while they were sleeping and picking up a harp which Bëor had laid aside played music upon it such as the ears of men had not heard. When the men awoke and listened to his song, each thought that he was in some fair dream. He long stayed with them, learning [[Taliska|their language]] and teaching them [[Sindarin]]. He also intervened on behalf of the [[Laiquendi]] of [[Ossiriand]], who feared Men would destroy their home, and he got permission of [[Thingol]], who held rule over all [[Beleriand]], to guide the Men to [[Estolad]].

Finrod had a close friendship with [[Andreth]] of the [[House of Bëor]], whom he often visited during the [[Siege of Angband]] to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.

Finrod participated at the [[Dagor Bragollach]] fighting in the [[Fen of Serech]] when he was surrounded by [[Orcs]]. It was [[Barahir]] of the [[House of Bëor]] who saved his life, and Finrod swore an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and all his kin. As a token he gave Barahir his ring, which became known as the [[Ring of Barahir]].

=== Quest for the Silmaril ===
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Finrod is reminded of his oath.jpeg|thumb|[[Anke Eißmann]] - ''Finrod is reminded of his oath'']]
When, ten years later, Barahir's son [[Beren]] came to Nargothrond seeking help, Finrod went with him on the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] to repay his debt. [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using barely veiled threats related to their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]) most of Nargothrond to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one [[Edrahil]], were faithful and came with them. Beneath the [[Shadowy Mountains]] they came upon a company of [[Orcs]], and slew them all in their camp. They took their gear and weapons and by the magic of Finrod their own forms and faces were changed to the likeness of Orcs. Thus disguised they came far upon their northward road between [[Ered Wethrin]] and the highlands of [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]. However the twelve were captured and imprisoned by [[Sauron]] on [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] ("Isle of Werewolves"). Thus befell the contest of Finrod and Sauron. Finrod strove with Sauron in songs of power, and the power of the Elven King was very great but in the end Sauron had the mastery. It is told in the [[Lay of Leithian]]:

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
  He chanted a song of wizardry,
  Of piercing, opening, of treachery,
  Revealing, uncovering, betraying.
  Then sudden Felagund there swaying
  sang in answer a song of staying,
  Resisting, battling against power,
  Of secrets kept, strength like a tower,
  And trust unbroken, freedom, escape;
  Of changing and of shifting shape,
  Of snares eluded, broken traps,
  The prison opening, the chain that snaps,
    Backwards and forwards swayed their song.
  Reeling and foundering, as ever more strong
  The chanting swelled, Felagund fought,
  And all the magic and might he brought,
  Of Elvenesse into his words.
  Softly in the gloom they heard the birds
  Singing afar in Nargothrond,
  The sighing of the sea beyond,
  Beyond the western world, on sand,
  On sand of pearls in Elvenland.
    Then the gloom gathered; darkness growing
  In Valinor, the red blood flowing
  Beside the sea, where the Noldor slew
  The Foamriders, and stealing drew
  Their white ships with their white sails
  From lamplit havens. The wind wails,
  The wolf howls. The ravens flee.
  The ice mutters in the mouths of the sea.
  The captives sad in Angband mourn,
  Thunder rumbles, the fires burn-
  And Finrod fell before the throne.     
</poem>

Then Sauron stripped from them their disguise, but though their kinds were revealed, he could not discover their names or their purposes. Then Sauron imprisoned them and one by one they were killed by werewolves until only Beren and Felagund were left, but none of the companions betrayed them. And when the werewolf came to kill Beren, Felagund put forth all his power and burst his bonds; and he wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with his hands and teeth. Yet he himself was wounded to the death, and he died in the dark, in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus King Finrod Felagund, the fairest and most beloved of the house of [[Finwë]], redeemed his oath.

=== Reincarnation ===
[[File:Donato Giancola - Lore.jpeg|thumb|An Elf loremaster ponders at a mural of Finrod leading his House in battle]]
Because of Finrod's noble actions in life, and his reluctance to journey to Middle-earth, he was reincarnated after only a short time. He and [[Glorfindel]] were the only elves who were known to have been reincarnated before the [[War of Wrath]]. It is noted in the ''Lay of Leithian'' that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor, and "now dwells with Amarië", so they probably were wed later. It is also noted in [[The Silmarillion]] that "''Finrod walks with Finarfin  his father beneath the trees in [[Eldamar]]''".

== Etymology ==
The name Finrod is the Sindarin form of his [[father-name]] ''Findaráto'' ("[Golden-]Haired Champion"). His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Ingoldo]]'' ("The Noldo", singular for [[Noldor]]) or the name can also mean 'one-eminent of the kindred' which is in simpler words 'the wise.' 

'''''Felagund''''' was an [[epessë]] given to him by the [[Dwarves]] that expanded the caves of Nargothrond, and meant "Hewer of Caves". It is not Sindarin, but rather Sindarised [[Khuzdul]], from ''[[Felakgundu]]''.

Finrod was also called ''[[Nóm]]'' ("Wisdom") by [[Bëor]] and his [[House of Bëor|people]]. His other titles include "Master of Caves" (by the Dwarves), "King of Nargothrond", "Lord of Nargothrond", and "[[Friend-of-Men]]" which in elvish was ''[[Edennil]]'' and ''[[Atandil]]'', [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] respectively.

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In earlier versions of the Middle-earth myths (see: [[The History of Middle-earth]]), and in the first edition of [[The Lord of the Rings]], the name '''Finrod''' was given to the character later known as Finarfin. Finrod Felagund was then named '''[[Inglor Felagund]]'''. However, that changed in later drafts, and the character who had the name [[Gildor Inglorion]], in ''The Lord of the Rings'', was unrelated to Finrod despite having a name that means Gildor son of Inglor. Finrod was childless and unmarried during the events of ''The Silmarillion'' because his lover, Amarië, remained in Valinor.<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>

In the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is Finrod's brother: this was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and an admitted mistake. Orodreth was actually the son of Angrod and thus Finrod's nephew.
