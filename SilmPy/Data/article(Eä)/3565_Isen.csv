The River '''Isen''' (or '''''Sîr Angren''''' in [[Sindarin]]<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 6, p. 214</ref>) was a river in [[Middle-earth]].
==Course==
The source of the river was in the southern [[Misty Mountains]], first flowing south through [[Nan Curunír]] and across the [[Gap of Rohan]] to the edge of the [[White Mountains]], where it abruptly bent west and ran to the sea of [[Belegaer]].  At a distance of about 50 [[lár|lári]] west of the [[Gap of Rohan]], the Isen was joined by its tributary, the river [[Adorn]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  The [[North-South Road]] crossed the river at the [[Fords of Isen]] where there was a small eyot.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 356</ref> About a mile east of the gates of Isengard, a bridge had been built over the Isen where it ran through a deep channel.<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[Third Age]] Isen and [[Adorn]] formed the boundary of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]], but the triangle of land between Isen, Adorn, and the White Mountains was a contested land, claimed by the [[Rohirrim]] as well as the [[Dunlendings]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Note 4, p. 364</ref>

The Isen formed a natural boundary in the Gap of Rohan, and was only crossable at Isengard or at the [[Fords of Isen]], where the Rohirrim fought a number of great battles against the Dunlendings and [[Saruman]]'s [[Orcs]] in the late [[Third Age]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

When the [[Ents]] attacked [[Isengard]], they dammed the Isen and other springs and streams in Nan Curunír, and dug trenches to divert the river's flow, before breaking the dams and temporarily drowning all of Isengard.<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Why the river was called ''Isen'', or "Iron" in modern English, is not known. Presumably the grey pebbles on the bottom and the banks of the river made the water look iron-grey.
