'''King of Rhovanion''' was a title claimed by [[Vidugavia]], a prince of the [[Northmen]], in the 13th century of the [[Third Age]]. However, even if he was the most powerful of the many Northern princes, he never truly unified all the Northmen under his claimed kingship.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

Vidugavia's own realm, the "[[Rhovanion|Kingdom of Rhovanion]]", was between [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]] and the [[River Running]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> He had a line of successors, and it seems that they continued to style themselves "King of Rhovanion" after Vidugavia's time.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> The use of the title, at least by the direct line, could not have continued past [[Third Age 1856|T.A 1856]], when Vidugavia's descendant Marhwini led his people out of Rhovanion to resettle in the Vales of Anduin.<ref group=note>The [[Lord of the Eotheod|Lords of the Eotheod]] claimed descent from the '...kings of Rhovanion, whose realm lay beyond Mirkwood before the invasions of the Wainriders...' according to Appendix II to ''The Lord of the Rings''. The use of the plural 'kings' here suggests that Vidugavia was not the only claimant of the title. This also implies that the kingdom lasted until the Wainrider invasions suggesting that there was a king during this time.</ref>
