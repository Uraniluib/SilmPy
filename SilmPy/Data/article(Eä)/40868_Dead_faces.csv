The '''dead faces''', or '''candles of corpses''', were apparitions of [[Ghosts|ghostly]] faces of dead [[Elves|Elven]], [[Men|Mannish]], and [[Orcs|Orcish]] warriors in the [[Mere of Dead Faces]] in the [[Dead Marshes]]. The faces, rotting and twisted, with weed caught in their hair, appeared in dark waters being lit by pale and fell lights, as from unseen candles.

How the dead warriors came to be transformed into such [[undead]] beings is unknown, but [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] speculated about "devilry hatched in the Dark Land", likely referring to [[Sauron]]'s dark arts in the nearby [[Mordor]].<ref>{{TT|IV2}}</ref>

==Etymology==

A ''corpse candle'' is defined as a "luminous appearance, resembling the flame of a candle, sometimes seen in churchyards and other damp places, superstitiously regarded as portending death".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Corpse+candle|articlename=Corpse candle (in ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', published 1913 by C. & G. Merriam Co.)|dated=|website=[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ TheFreeDcitionary.com]|accessed=3 August 2012}}</ref>

For a poem, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] created the [[Qenya]] phrase ''ve kaivo-kalma'', meaning "as a corpse-candle".<ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 85</ref>
