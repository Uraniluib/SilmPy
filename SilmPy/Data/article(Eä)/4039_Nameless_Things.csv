'''Nameless Things'''  were creatures that are said to have dwelled in the depths of [[Arda]] (though they are only known to have lived under the [[Misty Mountains]]). They tunnelled deeper than any [[Dwarves|dwarf]] would ever go.<ref name="tWR"/> 

They were described by [[Gandalf]] as very ancient, but their actual origin is unknown. Their nature or appearance are a mystery, but since they are as old as the world, they must have been a part of the [[Music of the Ainur|Ainulindalë]]<ref>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> or (since Sauron knew them not), a by-product of it.

The [[Balrogs|Balrog]] known as [[Durin's Bane]] learned their tunnels while living in the depths of Moria. After Gandalf fell with him in the abyss, Durin's Bane seemed to know his way up and found the [[Endless Stair]]. He was Gandalf's only hope and he followed him.<ref name="tWR"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Nameless is a creature type categorized as "Ancient Evil". They have a variety of shapes, but most of them are humanoid, only with no eyes or no head at all. The [[Watcher in the Water]] is classified as Nameless, as is "Helchgam", another tentacled creature found in the sewers of [[Carn Dûm]].
