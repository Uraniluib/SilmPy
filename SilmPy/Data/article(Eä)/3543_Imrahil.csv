'''Imrahil''' was the twenty-second [[Prince of Dol Amroth]]. 

==History==
===Early life===
Imrahil was the son of [[Adrahil II]]. He had two older sisters, [[Ivriniel]] and [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]]. After his father's death, he became Prince in {{TA|3010}}. Imrahil had four children:  [[Elphir]], [[Erchirion]], [[Amrothos]] and [[Lothíriel]].<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref>
===War of the Ring===

[[Image:John Howe - Prince Imrahil.jpg|left|100px|thumb|[[John Howe]] - ''Prince Imrahil'']]
During the [[War of the Ring]], Imrahil came to the aid of his brother-in-law, [[Denethor|Denethor II]]. On [[9 March]], {{TA|3019}}, he came into [[Minas Tirith]] with a company of knights and seven hundred soldiers.<ref name="MT">{{RK|MT}}</ref>
On [[13 March]], as [[Southrons]] harrassed [[Faramir]], Imrahil and his knights, with [[Gandalf]], formed a sortie, and Imrahil himself saved his sister-son from his pursuers. Faramir received a poisonous wound, and Denethor fell to madness. Being the highest ranking officer in [[Gondor]] fit for battle, Imrahil took command, and quickly passed it on to Gandalf. 

Two days later, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] raged before the city. Imrahil ventured outside the city, and witnessed the funeral procession of [[Théoden]]. He recognized that [[Éowyn]] still lived (though she lie an inch from death), and brought her to the [[Houses of Healing]]. 

Because [[Éomer]] and his riders were outnumbered, Imrahil rode into battle, together with [[Húrin (Warden of the Keys)|Húrin the Tall]], [[Forlong|Forlong of Lossarnach]] and [[Hirluin|Hirluin the Fair]], and they were soon joined by [[Aragorn]] who landed at [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]]. Imrahil continued East, driving the frightened [[Variags]] and [[orcs]] away. 

Imrahil survived the battle unscathed, and together with Éomer and Aragorn he came to the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]].<ref name="Battle">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city, because he knew Denethor was strong-willed and proud. 

When Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the position of Steward.

During the [[Last Debate|debate]] of the [[Captains of the West]], Gandalf proposed that they march to the [[Morannon]] to distract Sauron's attention from [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] the Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn, but since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that some should remain to defend the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed at the thought.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref> [[Húrin the Tall]] was left behind in command.

The [[Host of the West]] left Minas Tirith on [[18 March]]. Bypassing [[Minas Morgul]] and marching North, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar at Imrahil's advice. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood on the front line with his men. They fought the [[Battle of the Morannon]] until [[the One Ring]] was destroyed. 

Prince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the [[field of Cormallen]], and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in [[Edoras]] after the King's burial on [[August 10]]. Imrahil and Éomer became great friends, and in {{FoA|2}} Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter [[Lothíriel]].<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

===Later life===
After the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew [[Faramir]], [[Prince of Ithilien]], were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Great [[Council of Gondor]], and remained an advisor of the King.<ref>{{L|244}}</ref>

Prince Imrahil died in the year {{FoA|34|n}} of the [[Fourth Age]], and was succeed by his eldest son [[Elphir]], who continued the line of Princes.<ref name="Elendil"/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Imrahil.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Imrahil'' is said to be of [[Adûnaic|Númenórean]] origin,<ref>{{App|E}}</ref> though its exact meaning is uncertain.

The second element ''-hil'', also seen in the name ''[[Adrahil (disambiguation)|Adrahil]]'', is perhaps related to the [[Westron]] ending ''-kil''<ref group=note>This ending is found in words like ''[[banakil]], [[Tarkil]]'' and possibly means "person" or "man"</ref> and perhaps ultimately related to [[Elvish]] "follower" ([[KHILI#Other versions|KHIL]]).<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130308120545/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html|articlename=Etymologies of Atani languages|website=Lalaith's Science Pages}}</ref><ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 364</ref>

Considering the Elvish root KHIL, [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] have proposed as a possible meaning "Heir of [[Imrazôr]]".<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], [[Patrick Wynne]], "An Adunaic Dictionary", published in ''[[Vinyar Tengwar 25]]'' (September [[1992]])</ref>
