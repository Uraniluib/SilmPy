'''Bindbole Wood''' was a small wood in the southern part of the [[Northfarthing]] in [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==Name==
The name appears in the map of the Shire, but the letter ''o'' in the 1954 edition was not very clear; thus the name has been rendered '''Bindbale''' in many later maps (e.g. by [[Barbara Strachey]] and [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]), and elsewhere, like in [[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' (s.v. ''Bindbale'').

Even Tolkien himself referred to ''Bindbale'' in a manuscript note when he was preparing the document later known as ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lvii</ref>

==Etymology==
The name presumably contains [[Wiktionary:bole#Etymology_1|bole]] "trunk of a tree".<ref name=etym>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
