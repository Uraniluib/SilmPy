'''Fëanorian lamps''' were lamps which emitted a blue light from a flame from within a white crystal. They are described as "crystals hung in a fine chain net, the crystals being ever shining with an inner blue radiance". The lamps were created in [[Valinor]] and the flame could not  be extinguished by wind or water  The [[Noldor]] were famous for the flames, but unfortunately the craft was lost with them.  [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] possessed one of these lamps when he met [[Tuor]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

Some of the Noldor who had been captured by [[Morgoth]] and put to work in his mines had Fëanorian lamps with them.  [[Gwindor]] was one of these enslaved Elves; when he escaped he took with him one of these lamps.<ref name="CH9">{{CH|9}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The lamps were part of the [[legendarium]], but [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not include any such reference in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''. For example, in one version of the story [[Túrin Turambar]] recognised the face of [[Beleg]] whom he had slain by the light of Gwindor's lamp;<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, note 2</ref> yet in the version included in the ''Silmarillion'', it was lightning which revealed Beleg's face to Túrin.<ref name="CH9"/>

The scene where [[Gwindor]] of [[Nargothrond]] escaped from [[Angband]] and was found by [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] in the forest of [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] with one of these lamps was painted by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and published in ''[[Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' (1979), no. 37.
