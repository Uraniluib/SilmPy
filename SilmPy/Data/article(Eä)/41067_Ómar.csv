'''Ómar''', also called '''Amillo''',<ref name=III/> was a [[Valar|Vala]] who knew all [[languages]].<ref>{{LT1|II}}p. 47</ref> He was considered to be the youngest of all the Valar.<ref name=III>{{LT1|III}}, p. 67</ref>

Ómar only appeared in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== Etymology ==
''Ómar'' and ''Amillo'' are [[Qenya]] names. The former is related to Qenya ''ōma'' "voice", while the latter is glossed as "one of the Happy Folk; Hilary", where ''Hilary'' derives from Latin ''hilaris'' "cheerful". 

The [[Gnomish]] equivalents of his names are '''''Ûmor''''' and '''''Gamlos''''' (likely meaning "one who shouts with joy").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>
