[[File:Soni Alcorn-Hender - Lórien Flets.jpg|thumb|[[Soni Alcorn-Hender]] - ''Lórien Flets'']]'''Telain''' ([[Sindarin]], plural of ''Talan''<ref name="UT">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>), known in [[Westron]] as '''flets''', were platforms built in the trees by the [[Galadhrim]] [[Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]].

==History==
''Telain'' were built high up [[Mallorn]] trees, created in the space where the trunk of the tree divided into many branches; they lacked walls, or even rails, but portable screens were put to keep out the wind; they were only accessible via a lowered ''[[hithlain]]'' rope-ladder. They were mainly used as guard-posts and watch-towers around the edges of [[Lothlórien]].<ref name="Loth">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> 

In [[Caras Galadhon]], however, ''telain'' were more common and served more of a ceremonial function: it was on a house built on a ''talan'' that the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] met with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]].<ref name="Mirror">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:''Telain'' were retained in the film, although there were no moveable plaited screens or rope-ladders visible. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the meeting with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] took place inside a large hall built on a ''talan'',<ref name="Mirror">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> whereas in the film it took place on an open ''talan''.
==Etymology==
''Flet'' is an archaic English word referring to the floor of a house or a flat.

The [[Sindarin]] word ''talan'' or ''tâl'' ("flat space, platform"; pl. ''telain'') is a descendant form of [[Common Eldarin]] ''talam-''. The [[Quenya]] form is ''talma'' or ''talan'', pl. ''talami''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 52</ref>
