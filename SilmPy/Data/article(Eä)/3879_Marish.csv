The '''Marish''' was a fertile but boggy<ref name="shortcut">{{FR|I4}}</ref> farmland region in the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]]. 

The region was defined as the area on the western banks of the River [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] between [[Stock]] and [[Rushey]]; the two villages were connected by the [[Causeway]], which traversed the Marish.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> Between the two villages was the lane to [[Bamfurlong]], and five miles north of that was the road to the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref> 

==History==
Marish was occupied by [[Hobbits]] that came later into the Shire than other Hobbits, mostly [[Stoors]] who arrived around {{SR|30}}, from the south.<ref name=hobbits/>

In {{SR|379}} [[Bucca of the Marish]] was elected [[Thain]] to rule the Shire in the stead of the former [[King of Arthedain]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Marish was the home of the [[Oldbucks]], and Thainship, for several centuries; that was until Bucca's descendant Thain [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], left the Marish in {{SR|740}}<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> to colonize [[Buckland]] and became its first Master. Thainship passed to the [[Tooks]], but many farmers of the Marish acknowledged the authority of the [[Master of Buckland]] rather than that of the Thain.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>

During [[Frodo Baggins]]'s trek across the Shire, he and his companions left the road in the [[Green Hills]] in order to take a shortcut across the Marish to Buckland.<ref name="shortcut"/>
==Culture==
Having arrived later and separately from most Shire hobbits, the folk of the Marish had many peculiar names and strange words in their speech (see: [[Stoorish]]). The Stoors were the only hobbits who wore boots in muddy weather; most of the inhabitants of the Marish were house-dwellers,<ref name=hobbits>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> the land being obviously unsuitable for the burrowing of [[hobbit-holes]]. [[Bamfurlong]] was the home of [[Farmer Maggot]], stoutly built of brick, with a high wall all around it, protected by three large dogs. 

The [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]] in this region were more cautious than their fellow Hobbits who lived farther from the borders, and so they sought protection from the dangers beyond the River.
