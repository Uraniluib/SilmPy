'''Bruithwir''' was the father of [[Fëanor]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One|The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="LT1">{{LT1|VI}}, p. 145</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] toyed with the idea of him being Fëanor's brother or his son, but chose to make him his father.<ref name="LT2">{{LT1|VI}}, p. 155</ref> Fëanor's father in the later versions of the [[legendarium]], [[Finwë]], was already in existence but was unrelated to Fëanor.<ref name="LT3">{{LT1|V}}, p. 132</ref>

== History ==
On the last day of the feast of Double Mirth, [[Morgoth|Melko]] went to [[Sirnúmen]], where many of the [[Noldor|Gnomes]] lived at that time, and killed those guarding the treasures. He killed Bruithwir and seized the [[Silmarils]].<ref name="LT1"/>

His tomb was known as the [[Mound of the First Sorrow]], which was so named because of all the sorrow that Bruithwir's death was to achieve.<ref name="LT4">{{LT1|VI}}, p. 149-50</ref>
