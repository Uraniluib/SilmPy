'''Goldórin''' is the [[Telerin]] word for "[[Noldorin]]", that means [[Quenya]]; the Teleri knew it primarily as the tongue of the [[Noldor]], for they had few contacts with the [[Vanyar]]<ref>{{HM|WJ}} p. 375</ref>. 
==Etymology==
The first element of the word Goldórin, is the compound form of [[Golodo]] "Noldo"; the long ''ó'' of the word reflects the long final vowel of the [[primitive Elvish]] word ''[[ñgolodô]]''.
