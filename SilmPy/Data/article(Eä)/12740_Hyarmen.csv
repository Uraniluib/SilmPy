==Etymology==
In the West-lands of [[Middle-earth]] the four cardinal directions were ''[[Númen]], Hyarmen, [[Rómen]],'' and ''[[Formen]]'', and they were named in this order, beginning with (and facing) west.  ''Hyarmen'' meant a left-hand region and ''Formen'' meant a right-hand region.<ref name="Names"/>  Thus the word for "south" derives from the [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHYAR]], meaning "left hand", plus [[MEN]] indicating direction.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, KHYAR-</ref>

==Examples==
*''[[Hyarmentir|'''Hyarmen'''tir]]''
