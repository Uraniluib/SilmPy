''loth'' is the singular form of the collective noun ''[[loth]]'',<ref group=note>Editor [[Carl F. Hostetter]] notes that ''lotheg'' is formed by the addition of a diminuitive/singular ending ''-eg/-ig'' to the plural form ''loth'', much like in [[Welsh]] where a singular noun can derive "from a plural form by the addition of a singular ending". Cf. {{VT|42a}}, p. 30 (note 42).</ref> deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] LOT ("flower").<ref name=VT42/>
