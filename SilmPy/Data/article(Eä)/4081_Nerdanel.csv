'''Nerdanel''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈnerdanel]}}) was the daughter of the [[Noldor|Noldorin]] smith [[Mahtan]] and the wife of [[Fëanor]]. 

== History ==
===Early life===
Nerdanel was a skilful sculptor. She made statues so lifelike that people thought they were real at first, and if they did not know her art, tried to speak to them.<ref name=nerdanel>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> She also created sculptures from her own imaginings, which were "strong and strange but beautiful."<ref name=Feanor/> In her youth, Nerdanel loved to wander along the shore or in the hills of [[Aman]]. Whilst wandering, she met Fëanor, and they "were companions in many journeys."<ref name=Feanor>{{MR|P3II5}}</ref>

Though her father, whose nickname meant 'fox',<ref name=Sons>{{PM|Feanor}}</ref>{{rp|353}} was specifically noted as having an unusual hair colour for a Noldo, auburn or brown hair mixed with copper, her own hair colour is implied as brown or similar to her father's, but it is not explicitly stated in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. However, the reddish hair of Nerdanel's kin was passed down to her children.

===Marriage and Motherhood===
When Nerdanel married Fëanor, others wondered at his choice for she was not considered among "the fairest of her people."<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|272}} But Nerdanel was strong, free of mind, and filled with the desire for knowledge.<ref name=Feanor/> Though she was strong-willed, she was more patient than her husband. She would seek to understand others instead of master them. For a time, since Fëanor would seek the counsel of none save her, she was able to influence and restrain her prideful husband.<ref name=nerdanel/> However, Fëanor's later deeds deeply grieved her. She was advised not to become involved in the rebellion. In the end, Nerdanel and her husband became estranged from one another, and she did not follow him to Middle-earth.<ref name=nerdanel/>

Nerdanel bore Fëanor seven sons: [[Maedhros]], [[Maglor]], [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]], [[Curufin]], [[Amrod]], and [[Amras]] (see [[Sons of Fëanor]]). Elves typically have four children or fewer, so the size of their family was particularly noteworthy.<ref name=NotesB>{{MR|P3II3e}}</ref>{{rp|Note 4}} Nerdanel's calmer temperament had passed to some of her sons while others were fiery more like their father.<ref name=nerdanel/> Only her eldest son Maedhros and her youngest sons, Amrod and Amras, inherited the reddish-brown hair from her line.<ref name=Sons/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Nerdanel was described as having a ruddy complexion and brown hair in ''Vinyar Tengwar''.<ref>{{VT|41b}}</ref> 

When Fëanor was banished from [[Túna]] for drawing a sword against his brother, Nerdanel did not join her family in banishment, which was not specified in ''[[The Silmarillion]].'' In ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', she asked for leave to abide with [[Indis]] during that time.<ref name=Unrest>{{MR|P3II6}}</ref>{{rp|279}}

When Nerdanel, who had since returned to her father's house, learned that her husband and sons were planning to go into exile to Middle-earth, she begged Fëanor to leave with her their youngest sons, Amrod and Amras, or at least one of them. Fëanor's response was that, if she would not follow him, she was an untrue wife for deserting both her husband and her children.<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|354}} 

Regardless, Nerdanel refused to follow because she heeded the warning of Aulë that: "'It [the rebellion] will in the end only lead Fëanor and all your children to death.'"<ref name=Feanor/> As predicted she lost all her children in Middle-earth, and she survived her husband and her children in Aman;<ref name=nerdanel/> the only exception being [[Maglor]], who, after throwing his Silmaril in the sea, was rumoured to be wandering the shores of Middle-earth signing songs of lament.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The name ''Nerdanel'' is given no clear meaning or etymology in the published writings of Tolkien. The original (rejected) version of her name was ''Istarnië''.<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|273}}

Editor and linguist [[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that the element ''nerd-'' in ''Nerdanel'' perhaps derives from ''nerdo'' ("large, strong man"), noting that the name "''might refer to her strength of body and mind, and her pursuits of crafts more commonly practiced by men.''" Wynne also suggests that ''Istarnië'' derives from Quenya ''[[ista-]]'' ("know"), apparently "''referring to her 'desire for knowledge'''".<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 33-4</ref>

She was known as Nerdanel the wise.<ref name=nerdanel/>
