==Etymology==
Arahad's name is [[Sindarin]], but its etymology is uncertain. It contains the usual royal prefix ''[[ar|ara-]]'' meaning "king", but the ''had'' is a little harder to work out. It could be ''had'' meaning "hurl, throw", it could be ''sad'' ([[Lenition|lenited]] to ''had'') meaning "place, spot", or it could be related to ''sador'' meaning "faithful person".
