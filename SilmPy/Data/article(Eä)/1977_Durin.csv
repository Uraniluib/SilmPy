'''Durin I''' ([[Years of the Trees]] – [[First Age]]), also known as '''Durin the Deathless''' due to his longevity, was the first of the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], the founder of the city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], and the first king of the [[Longbeards]]. 

==History==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Aulë and the Seven Fathers.jpg‎|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Aulë and the Seven Fathers'']]
Long before the awakening of the [[Elves]] it is said that Aulë, yearning for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], fashioned the Seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] in a hall under the mountains in [[Middle-earth]].  Pleased with his work, Aulë was instructing his creations in the [[Khuzdul|speech]] he had devised for them when [[Ilúvatar]] rebuked him, pointing out that they were mere counterfeits that would only stand idle without Aulë’s will.  Aulë humbled himself before Ilúvatar and prepared to destroy the Dwarves, but at that moment Ilúvatar gave them independent life.  However, Ilúvatar would not suffer their arrival in the world before the Firstborn, so the seven fathers were laid to sleep until after the coming of the [[Elves]].<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>

Ilúvatar commanded Aulë to lay the sleeping fathers in deep places, each with a mate, save Durin the eldest who had none.<ref>{{L|212}}</ref>  Durin was set to sleep under [[Mount Gundabad]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] during the [[Years of the Trees]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  
===King of the Longbeards===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Durin I Discovers the Three Peaks.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Durin I Discovers the Three Peaks'']]
When he awoke he journeyed south alone through the wild where no person ever wandered before, and gave name to "nameless hills and dells", perhaps [[Azanulbizar]] and the nearby features<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>. He came upon [[Kheled-zâram]]. Looking upon [[Seven Stars|mysterious stars]] set [[Durin's Crown|like a crown]] reflected in its surface, he took this as a sign, and there in the caves above the lake, founded a great city. This was [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], later called [[Moria]], and for many years it was the greatest Dwarven city in Middle-earth.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Durin was the founder of the [[Longbeards]] house, which became known as [[Durin's folk]].  He lived to a great age even by the measure of the Dwarves until he was known as "The Deathless". However, he was not actually immortal, and died sometime during the First Age.<ref name="Durin"/>

All that can be known for certain about his age, is that he was born before {{YT|1250}}<ref name="GA">{{GA|19}}</ref> and died before the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name="Durin"/> This makes Durin ''at least'' 2,395 years old, about ten-times the lifespan of [[Dwarves]].<ref group="note">[[coranar|Years of the Sun]]. Each Year of the Trees is equal to 9.582 Years of the Sun, and the Years of the Trees ended in the year 1500. So, 9.582 x 250 = 2,395.</ref>

==Legacy==
The Longbeards believed that Durin would return to them seven times, and in each reincarnation he will again be named Durin and reign as King.  He did have six descendants that were named Durin, all were kings of Durin's folk.<ref name="Durin"/>

[[Durin's Axe]], a great heirloom of Durin's folk, was probably his; it was apparently found when [[Balin]] and [[Balin's colony|his colony]] came to Khazad-dûm in {{TA|2989}}.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref><ref>{{App|B2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
