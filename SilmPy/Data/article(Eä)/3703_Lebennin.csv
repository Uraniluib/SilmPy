'''Lebennin''' (prounounced [{{IPA|lɛˈbɛn.nɪn}}] {{respell|le|ben|nin}}) was a region and fiefdom in southern [[Gondor]] south of the [[Ered Nimrais]] between the [[Gilrain]] and the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

Known as ''Fair Lebennin of the Five Streams'', referring to the [[Five Rivers of Lebennin]], it was one of the faithful fiefs of Gondor. Its largest city was [[Pelargir]].

Lebennin was largely populated by [[Men]] of mixed blood, as many Men of Lebennin traced their ancestry to the forgotten 'Men of the Mountains' that had been displaced from the [[White Mountains]] by the [[Númenor|Númenóreans]].

During the [[War of the Ring]], Lebennin did not send many Men to the aid of [[Minas Tirith]] as it was under attack by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> Lebennin was rescued by [[Aragorn]] and the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]] of [[Dunharrow]].<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

==Etymology==

'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:For game development purposes, Lebennin was divided into Lower Lebennin and Upper Lebennin, divided by [[Pelargir]] and the river [[Sirith]]. Lower Lebennin was the eastern-most area in Central Gondor and Upper Lebennin was the western-most area in Eastern Gondor. [[Dor-en-Ernil]] lay to the west across the river [[Gilrain]] and [[Lossarnach]] lay to the east across the river [[Erui]]. The emblem of Lebennin was five wavy blue lines representing the [[Five Rivers of Lebennin|Five Rivers]] on a white field. Aside from Pelargir, major settlements in Lebennin included "Ost Anglebed", "Glaniath", and [[Tumladen (Gondor)|Tumladen]], along with [[Linhir]] which was also part of [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. The smaller settlements, some of which had fallen to enemy forces before the breaking of the [[Siege of Gondor]], included "Ethilorn", "Sarnhad", "Malbarth", "Aerthir", "Lornost", "Erynos", and "Halach". A local tradition in Lebennin was the offering of gift baskets to the rivers in honor of the Five Sisters of Lebennin, though by the end of the [[Third Age]] few believed the Sisters were any more than a myth.
