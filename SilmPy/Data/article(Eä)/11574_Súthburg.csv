'''Súthburg''' was the name originally given by the [[Rohirrim]] to the fortress of [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]]. This was due to it being the southern of the fortresses that guarded the [[Gap of Rohan]] and the [[Fords of Isen]], [[Isengard]] being the other. After [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] sought refuge there in {{TA|2759}}, it was renamed [[Hornburg]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>
