The '''Westfarthing''' was one of the four [[Farthings]] of [[the Shire]]. Its easternmost point was the [[Three-Farthing Stone]]<ref name="Part">{{FR|Part}}</ref> and on its western border were the [[Far Downs]]<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> (and later, from {{FoA|31}} on, the region of [[Westmarch]]). Within its bounds was the "capital" of the Shire, [[Michel Delving]] and the ancestral homeland of the [[Took Family|Tooks]] (and thus the seat of the [[Thain]]), known as [[Tookland]].<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Also, in the Westfarthing was [[Hobbiton]], the home of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew, [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name="Part"/>

*Lakes: [[Bywater Pool]]
*Rivers: [[The Water]], possibly a portion of the [[Norbourn]]

==History==
Perhaps the most significant event regarding Westfarthing was when [[Isumbras Took I]] became a [[Thain]] in {{TA|2340}}, beginning the hereditary Thainship of the Took line.<ref name=order/> Thus Westfarthing was the centre of Hobbit "authority".

In {{TA|2941}}, the Unexpected Party occurred in the home of [[Bilbo Baggins]] at [[Bag End]]<ref name="third">{{App|TA}}</ref> in the West Farthing, and from the ''[[Green Dragon]]'' in [[Bywater]], the [[Quest of Erebor]] began.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> When Bilbo returned the next year he had to deal with an auction of his belongings since he had been presumed dead.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>

To celebrate his 111th and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo's]] 33rd birthdays as well as his departure from the Shire, in {{TA|3001}} Bilbo held a [[Farewell Party]].<ref name="third"/>

On [[23 September]] {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] left [[Bag End]] heading for [[Crickhollow]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

Upon their return from their adventures in the south, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] returned to the Shire and in the Westfarthing they were the leaders in the [[Battle of Bywater]], on [[1 November]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

==Culture==
Every seven years the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] was elected at the [[Free Fair]] on the [[White Downs]] at [[Lithe]].<ref name=order>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>

As Westfarthing was the centre of Hobbit authority, the dialect of the Westfarthing (in scattered parts) had retained the deferential pronoun of the proper [[Westron]] which was lost in other forms of [[Hobbitish]] language. It was used more as a light-hearted term of endearment.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
