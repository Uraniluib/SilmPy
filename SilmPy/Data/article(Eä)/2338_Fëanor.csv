{{quote|For Fëanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind: in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and subtlety alike: of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and a bright flame was in him.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]}}

'''Fëanor''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈfe.anor]}}) was a prince of the [[Noldor]], eldest and most beloved son of [[Finwë]]. He had the greatest skill of word and hand, a renowned craftsman, gem-smith, and warrior. His most famous deed was the creation of the [[Silmarils]], but he also created the ''[[palantíri]]''<ref name="SIndex">{{S|Index}}</ref>, and may also have wrought the [[Fëanorian lamps]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, note 2</ref> In addition, he invented the widely-used [[Tengwar]] script. His passionate hatred of [[Morgoth]] and terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] led directly to the great triumphs and tragedies of the [[First Age]].

== History ==
===Life in Tirion===
Born in {{YT|1169}},<ref>{{MR|P2k}}, Note 1, p.101</ref> Curufinwë Fëanáro (as was his original name in [[Quenya]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌkuruˈfinweˌ fe.aˈnaːro ]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌkuruˈɸinweˌ ɸe.aˈnaːro ]}}<ref name="Shibboleth">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>) was the eldest son of Finwë, the [[King of the Noldor]], and his first wife [[Míriel|Míriel Serindë]]. He drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living, and departed to [[Lórien in Valinor|Lórien]], where she voluntarily left her corporeal form and died.  Finwë remarried, and had two more sons, Fëanor's half-brothers [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]],<ref name="Feanor">{{S|Feanor}}</ref> and two daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]].<ref name="Shibboleth"/>
[[File:Ryszard Derdzinski - Feanor.jpg|thumb|left|Feanor, deviser of the Tengwar]]
Fëanor's skills began to blossom and other than a skilled smith, he was a linguist and a [[Lambengolmor|Loremaster]].<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 396-8</ref> In {{YT|1250|n}} he devised the lettering system of [[Tengwar]], improving the work of [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]].  He then turned his mind to the study of gems.<ref name="AAsec4">{{MR|P2j}}</ref>  
[[File:Tuuliky - Lumen Melma.jpg|thumb|Feanor and Nerdanel]]
While still a youth Fëanor wedded [[Nerdanel]], daughter of [[Mahtan]],<ref name="Feanor"/> who bore him [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]]: [[Maedhros]], [[Maglor]], [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]], [[Curufin]], [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

In {{YT|1400|n}}<ref name="AAsec4"/> [[Morgoth|Melkor]], the mightiest of the Valar and source of evil, deceived the Valar into thinking that he had repented of his evil ways.  Pardoned and residing in Valinor, he undertook to corrupt the Noldor and succeeded in making them instruments of his malice, particularly Fëanor. But Fëanor greatly mistrusted Melkor, which was part of Melkor's plan.<ref name="Feanor"/>

In {{YT|1449|n}} Fëanor began and by {{YT|1450|n}} he had succeeded<ref name="AAsec4"/> in the greatest of his achievements: capturing the light of the [[Two Trees]] to make the three [[Silmarils]], also called the Great Jewels. He prized the Silmarils above all else, and grew increasingly suspicious that the Valar and other Eldar coveted them. He either vainly displayed the jewels or jealously guarded them from all except his immediate family.<ref name="Silmarils">{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

===Feud with Fingolfin===
[[Image:Antti Autio - The Threat of Feanor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Antti Autio]] - ''Fëanor's threat'']]
Melkor greatly desired the Silmarils and his hatred for Fëanor grew, but the Valar still did not know of Melkor's true intentions. Melkor played upon Fëanor's temperament and pride to convince him that his own half-brother Fingolfin was not only planning to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also seize the jewels for himself.<ref name="Silmarils"/> The Noldor then began forging weapons, which at that point no other Eldar possessed in Valinor. Fëanor's hostility grew to the point where, in {{YT|1490|n}},<ref name="AAsec4"/> he threatened Fingolfin's life. For this, the Valar exiled him to [[Formenos]]. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he stowed in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë withdrew to Formenos as well.<ref name="Silmarils"/>

The Valar realized that Melkor was behind Fëanor's actions. They sent [[Tulkas]] to imprison him again, but he could not be found. Melkor was not seen for a long time, until in {{YT|1492|n}},<ref name="AAsec4"/> he unexpectedly showed up at Formenos. Since with Finwë and Fëanor's absence Fingolfin had become king, it seemed that Melkor's lies were true. Melkor tried again to manipulate Fëanor, but he went too far, and Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils. He shut the door in Melkor's face. In a rage, Melkor left. When the Valar heard of the incident, they resumed the hunt. But it was apparent that Melkor had fled from Valinor.<ref name="Silmarils"/>

===Theft of the Silmarils===
In {{YT|1495|n}}<ref name="AAsec4"/> the Valar sought to reconcile Fëanor and Fingolfin, and to mend the enmity between the Noldor and Valar, and invited them all to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest, which he grudgingly accepted.

[[File:Amanyar - Fëanor device.png|right|120px|thumb|Fëanor's device.]]Meanwhile, after first feigning to go north, Melkor had stolen away to [[Avathar]] in the south of Aman to seek out the evil, spider-like creature [[Ungoliant]]. Even as Fëanor and Fingolfin were reconciled, Ungoliant helped Morgoth destroy the Two Trees, bringing darkness to Valinor.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

[[Yavanna]] examined the Two Trees and found them lifeless. The light of the Trees survived only in the Silmarils and she said that only by their power could she restore the Trees. [[Manwë]] then asked Fëanor to give them up for this purpose but Fëanor emphatically declared that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will; if the Valar forced him, he said, they would be no better than Melkor.  It was after this that messengers came telling of the raid at Formenos.

According to the messengers, Melkor, surrounded by an impenetrable black fog, had come to Fëanor's vault in Formenos. Finwë the King fought and lost against Melkor, and was the first to be slain in Valinor. Melkor ransacked the vault, taking many valuable jewels, including the Silmarils. He and Ungoliant escaped by crossing the [[Helcaraxë]], or Grinding Ice, in the north to [[Beleriand]] in Middle-earth.<ref name="Flight">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

===The Kinslaying===
[[Image:Tuuliky - Feanor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tuuliky - ''Fëanor'']]The Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's treachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor "Morgoth", or "Black Enemy". Claiming kingship over the Noldor, Fëanor delivered an impassioned speech, which he unwittingly filled with Morgoth's taint. He rallied the Noldor against the Dark Lord, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He persuaded most of his people that because the Valar had abandoned them, the Noldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight the Dark Lord. Fëanor then swore the terrible [[Oath of Fëanor]] which all seven of his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone—whether Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala—who withheld the Silmarils, and invoking even [[Ilúvatar]] as a witness. This Oath led to much conflict and later caused great tragedy among his seven sons.

Seeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman, where the seafaring [[Teleri]] lived, and demanded the use of their ships. When Teleri refused to give or lend their vessels, Fëanor ordered the Noldor to take the ships. The Teleri resisted, and a battle broke out, in which many of the Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows, against the fully armed Noldor.  Three times the Teleri were able to push back Fëanor until Fingolfin and Finarfin brought up their host, overwhelming the Teleri.

In repentance of this act, Finarfin, Finwë's third son, took his host and turned back. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as King of the remaining Noldor in Valinor.<ref name="Flight"/>
</br></br>

===Exile in Middle-earth===
[[File:NOLANOS - La Quema de las Naves.jpg|thumb|NOLANOS - ''La Quema de las Naves'']]
As the year {{YT|1496|n}} wore on Fëanor led the Noldor northward.  By {{YT|1497|n}} the host had reached the [[Helkaraxë]] and halted.<ref>{{MR|P2m}}</ref>  There were not enough ships to carry all of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon arriving at [[Losgar]], in the land of [[Lammoth]], in the far west of [[Beleriand]], where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, Fëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind.<ref name="Flight"/>  However, Fëanor accidentally left his son Amras in the ships and he was burned alive.<ref name="Shibboleth"/> The earth being flat in those days, the remaining Noldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to reach Middle-earth, they had no choice but to cross the Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered heavy losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.<ref name="Flight"/>
[[Image:Jenny Dolfen - Feanor's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jenny Dolfen - ''Fëanor's Last Stand'']]
Learning of the Noldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of [[Angband]] and attacked Fëanor's encampment in [[Mithrim]].  This battle was called the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] ("Battle under the Stars"), for the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] had not yet been made. The Noldor managed to win the battle and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed by a force of [[Balrogs]], with few elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing his foe even after receiving several wounds from [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], lord of Balrogs. 

His sons came upon the balrogs with great force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as Fëanor was being carried off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were fatal.  He was brought to the slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] from where he saw from afar the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]].  He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that his elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes. He was the only person to die this way, for no death like his was ever seen or heard.<ref name="S|Return">{{S|Return}}</ref>

His sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which would determine many of the events of Middle-earth during the First Age.

Fëanor's spirit remained in the [[Halls of Mandos]] and was not reincarnated in Valinor.<ref name="S|Return">{{S|Return}}</ref> It is said that he will return only for [[Dagor Dagorath]], and will finally reclaim his beloved Silmarils, and then surrender them to [[Yavanna]].<ref name "SM|CQ19">{{SM|CQ19}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Feanor.mp3|Ardamir}}
Fëanor's [[father-name]] was ''[[Curufinwë]]'', "Skillful Finwë", by adding ''[[curu]]'', the [[Quenya]] noun for "skill", to his father's name. He later gave his favorite son [[Curufin]] the same father-name. His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''Fëanáro''', which translates as "spirit of fire",<ref name="Shibboleth"/> being formed by adding ''[[fëa]]'', a Quenya noun for "spirit" and ''[[Nár (Quenya)|nár]]'', "flame". Apparently, the masculine ending ''[[-o]]'' is also present. 

The name Fëanor is the [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] version of his mother-name; the proper [[Sindarin]] form of his name was '''Faenor'''.<ref name="Shibboleth"/>
