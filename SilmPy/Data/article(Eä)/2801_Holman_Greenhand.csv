'''Holman Greenhand''' was a Hobbit of [[the Shire]], noted for being a fine gardener.

==History==
Holman's grandfather and namesake, [[Holman the greenhanded]], initiated both the family name and the family profession: gardening.<ref name="Gamgee">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> Holman became a gardener in [[Hobbiton]], and one of the gardens he tended was that of [[Bag End]]. Around {{TA|2941}}, he took on his distant cousin [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]] as an apprentice.<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref> 

One morning of that spring, [[Gandalf]] visited Bag End, but found its master, [[Bilbo Baggins]], not at home. Holman informed him that Bilbo had gone on one of his walks, as it was the [[Elves]]' [[Yestare|new year]]. Holman's description of Bilbo convinced Gandalf he had found the perfect man for his mission, to re-take [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name="Quest">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

When Bilbo went missing - that is, on his mission - Holman and Hamfast had their hands full in making sure the garden wasn't trampled as the place was swarming with Hobbits, hoping to get a piece of the Baggins estate.<ref name="Party"/>

Gaffer took over the job around {{TA|2961}},<ref>{{FR|Party}}: "[Gaffer Gamgee] had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years"</ref> about which time Holman retired or died.

==Etymology==
Holman means "hole-man", and is distinct from the real-life English surname<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref> which contains ''holm'' "river island" rather than ''hol'' "hole".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>

==Portrayal in Adaptation==
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:Holman lives in a hut on the other side of [[the Water]].
