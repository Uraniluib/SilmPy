'''Cair Andros''' was a large river-island in the [[Anduin|Anduin River]] that resembled a ship, hence the name.

==Geography==
The island itself was long and narrow, like a ship, a little over ten miles in length.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Its northern end of sharp rocks split the waters of the upstream Anduin in a bubbling foam like the "prow" of a ship, and this gave the island its name.<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}, Footnote 1</ref> Cair Andros was covered with trees for much of its length.<ref name="Cormallen">{{RK|VI4}}</ref>

The island was located to the east of the land of [[Anórien]] and about fifty miles<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 79</ref> north of [[Minas Tirith]]. Because of its location it was of strategic importance, and was one of the only practical means for an army to cros the river (the others were the bridge of [[Osgiliath]] and, until the formation of [[Rohan]], the [[Undeeps]]). As such, the island housed [[Gondorian]] fortifications at various points of history.

==History==
In the [[First Age]], as believed by historians in [[Gondor]], the first men to cross the Anduin were the [[Drúedain]].  It was thought that the Drúedain came westward south of [[Mordor]], turned north through [[Ithilien]], and crossed the Great River at or near Cair Andros before eventually settling in the vales of the [[White Mountains]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, ''Further Notes on the Drúedain''</ref>

Upon the establishment of the realm of Gondor, the island grew in strategic importance: after the granting of [[Calenardhon]] to the [[Éothéod]] in {{TA|2510}} (who created the realm of [[Rohan]])<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Cair Andros and Osgiliath remained as vulnerable crossing-points for the [[Gondorians]] who took Cair Andros' risk seriously. [[Amon Dîn]], the first of the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Beacon-hills]], was set up originally to warn the citizens of [[Minas Tirith]] if Cair Andros was ever breached.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 51</ref>

Gondor took steps to fortify the island, too.  In {{TA|1248}} [[Minalcar]], [[Regent of Gondor|regent]] to King [[Narmacil I]], defeated the [[Easterlings]] and upon his return fortified the west bank of the Anduin up to the [[Limlight]], which may have included the fortification of Cair Andros.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

The island was also manned at the time of King [[Ondoher]]'s fall.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> in {{TA|1944|n}},<ref name="TA"/> 

Centuries later, [[Túrin II]] fortified the island again in about the year {{TA|2900|n}} to protect Anórien.<ref name="Stewards"/>

===The War of the Ring===
On the same day that the [[Witch-king]] rode from [[Minas Morgul]] with the armies that would [[Siege of Gondor|besiege Minas Tirith]], Sauron released a smaller force (more than 6,000 Orcs and Men) from the [[Morannon]]. They overwhelmed the Gondorian defenses of Cair Andros on [[10 March]], {{TA|3019}} and used the island to cross into Anórien.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> This force blocked the eastward progress of the [[Rohirrim]] as they rode to Gondor's aid.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> 

However the Rohirrim used the secret ride down [[Stonewain Valley]]<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> and, after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], they chased that force down and pushed them back out of Anórien.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> Apparently the island was held by that force for some days. 

On [[23 March]],<ref name="Great"/> in his march on Mordor, [[Aragorn]] gave a leave to one thousand scared young men from Rohan and [[Lossarnach]] from his main army, with orders to retake the island if necessary.<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> They must have succeeded, since its moorings were used by the ships of Gondor, as glimpsed by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] after completing his Quest.<ref name="Cormallen"/>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Cair Andros'' translates to "Ship of Long Foam".<ref name="Stewards"/> ''[[cirya|Cair]]'' means "ship", ''[[and]]'' means "long", and ''[[ros]]'' means (in this context at least) "foam".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 121</ref>
