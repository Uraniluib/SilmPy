}}'''Túrin I''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2165|n}}<ref name="Elendil"/> – {{TA|2278|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 113 years) was the sixth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].
==History==
Túrin was named after the great hero of the [[First Age]].  Since the [[House of Húrin]] was a family of ancient Elf-friends they spoke [[Gondor Sindarin|Sindarin (after the fashion of Gondor)]] and often drew their names from legends of [[Elves]] or [[Men]] of the First Age.<ref name="Elendil"/>

Túrin's stewardship occurred during the period of the [[Watchful Peace]] ({{TA|2063}}-{{TA|2460|n}}).<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Túrin ruled as Steward for thirty-four years. Very unusually for a noble of Gondor, he married twice and had several daughters.  Only his last child, born in his old age, was a son,<ref name="Elendil"/> [[Hador (Steward of Gondor)|Hador]] by whom he was succeeded.<ref name="South"/>
