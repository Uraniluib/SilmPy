'''Aeglos''' was the name for the spear of [[High King of the Noldor]] [[Gil-galad]] which was greatly feared by the enemy. It was carried by the King to the [[War of the Last Alliance]], but it was broken when Gil-galad fell in combat against [[Sauron]] himself, on the slopes of [[Mount Doom]] {{SA|3431}}.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref><ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

==Etymology and names==
''Aeglos'' means "snow-point"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> or "icicle"<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Index]]''</ref>. The element ''aeg'' means "point" from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[AYAK]], "sharp, pointed", and the element ''los'' means "snow".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>

In editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' prior to 2005, the spear is spelled ''Aiglos''. Tolkien, however, commented in a manuscript that the more correct [[Sindarin]] spelling is in fact ''Aeglos''.<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 11</ref><ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 231</ref>
