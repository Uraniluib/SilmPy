'''Anárion's defense of Osgiliath''' began in {{SA|3429}} and continued until the arrival of the host of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] in {{SA|3434|n}}.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], Anárion and his brother [[Isildur]] established and shared the realm of [[Gondor]], setting thrones side by side in the Great Hall of Osgiliath.  Unbeknownst to them, [[Sauron]] also survived the Downfall and had reestablished himself in [[Mordor]].  When he deemed the time to be right, Sauron led a great force that took [[Minas Ithil]], destroyed the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree of Isildur]], and forced Isildur and his family (with a seedling of the tree) to flee down the [[Anduin]].  While Isildur journeyed to [[Elendil]], Anárion held Osgiliath and even drove the Enemy back to the mountains.  However, Sauron gathered new forces to attack so that Anárion had to maintain a defense of the city until help could arrive.  With the coming of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]] to the [[Dagorlad]] the threat to the city was ended.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>
