The '''Easterlings''' were [[Men]] who lived in the [[East]] of [[Middle-earth]], and were enemies of the [[Free peoples]]. 

== History ==
===First Age===
In the [[First Age]], Men [[Awakening of Men|awoke]] in [[Hildórien]] in the [[East]]. Some of them were early corrupted by [[Morgoth]], prompting others (the [[Edain]]) to migrate westwards.<ref name=dm>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

Centuries later, after [[Dagor Bragollach]], tribes of [[Men]] joined the Edain in [[Beleriand]], long after their arrival. These [[Easterlings (First Age)|Swarthy Men]] came from the east, probably [[Eriador]] and were also called "Easterlings". Two of their leaders were [[Bór]] and [[Ulfang]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
===Second Age===
In the [[Second Age]] [[Sauron]] escaped the judgment of the [[Valar]] and continued his former master's work, turning the Men of the [[East]] and [[South]] to evil and dominating them. Under the authority of the Dark Lord, many towns and walls of stone were built, and those under his influence became numerous and armed with iron. To these men, Sauron was feared as a king and god.<ref name=dm/><ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> 

During the [[Dark Years]] Sauron dominated most of the [[Westlands]], also urging men from the East to go the west for loot. Those troubled the [[Northmen]] who waged a war against them and the [[orcs]]. When Sauron was driven back to [[Mordor]], he continued his expansions eastwards gaining servants and worshippers.<ref name=dm/><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

===Third Age===
[[File:Easterling.jpg|thumb|right|An Easterling in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]
After Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], these "Wild Men" were released by his tyranny but they still had [[The Darkness|darkness]] in their hearts. Evil and restless, they battled against each other and some withdrew to the hated west.<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref> Thus they encountered the lands of [[Gondor]] and since then, tribes brought trouble periodically with several attacks and migrations. Even [[Northmen]] often assailed Gondor for a long time.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>

They first enter the records of [[Gondor]] in {{TA|490}} attacking Gondor from the plains between the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and the [[Ash Mountains]]. [[Tarostar]] managed a first victory against them in {{TA|500}}. In {{TA|541}} they invaded [[Ithilien]] but [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar of Gondor]] destroyed the horde and conquered a new territory in [[Rhûn]] for Gondor.<ref name=gondor/>

In the following centuries the Easterlings cease, while Gondor was free to extend its borders to [[South Gondor|the south]]. 

However, beyond the borders of Gondor, some "invaders from the East", no doubt moved by Sauron,<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #60</ref> came to [[Rhovanion]] harassing the Northmen, occupying [[Greenwood]] and traversing it, coming to the [[Vales of Anduin]]. These moves coincided with the coming of the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]], and these were the causes that drove the [[Hobbits]] to [[Eriador|the west]] around {{TA|1000}}.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

In the days of [[Narmacil I]] the Easterlings resumed their attacks, even some greedy Northmen joined them. In {{TA|1248}} an Easterling army marched in the lands between [[Rhovanion]] and the Sea of Rhûn. Forces from Gondor - aided by Northmen of Rhovanion - defeated them and destroyed their camps and settlements east of the Inland Sea.<ref name=gondor/>

After this defeat the Easterlings disappeared from the Gondorian records for some period, during which Gondor was again occupied with the south and the [[Corsairs of Umbar]].

=== The Wainriders ===
During that time tribes of Easterlings form the confederacy known as the '''[[Wainriders]]''' (q.v.) who would trouble the Kingdom and the Northmen.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

Gondor was weakened by the [[Great Plague]] and the Wainriders defeated the Gondorian army in {{TA|1856}}, raided the lands of [[Rhovanion]] and enslaved its people. Some of these lands eventually were reclaimed by King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]]. 

In {{TA|1944}} the Wainriders, allied with the [[Haradrim]] of [[Near Harad]] and the [[Variags]] of [[Khand]], managed a brief victory against Gondor, despite the assistance by the [[Éothéod]]; eventually they were [[Battle of the Camp|defeated]] in their camp during their celebrations. 

After this defeat the might of the Wainriders was broken although still held Rhovanion, and they retreated east. Most importantly, King [[Ondoher]] and both his sons were slain in that assault, an event that led to the extinction for the line of the [[Kings of Gondor]]. 

In {{TA|2063}} the Necromancer (who was actually Sauron) retreated from [[Dol Guldur]] for some centuries. That period was known as the [[Watchful Peace]] for the [[Westlands]], but during that time Sauron retreated to the East and managed to create a strong alliance between the various tribes of Easterlings.

===The Balchoth===
The '''[[Balchoth]]''' were a fierce race southeast of [[Mirkwood]], under orders of [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=A1ivS>{{App|A1ivS}}</ref> and no doubt related to the [[Wainriders]].<ref name=cirion/> In {{TA|2510}} they and [[Orcs]] overran the plains of [[Calenardhon]] and almost destroyed the army of Steward [[Cirion]], but were defeated by the [[Éothéod]].<ref name=A1ivS/><ref name=cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

In {{TA|2545}} some Easterlings renewed their attacks and entered the new-founded [[Rohan]]. Thus [[Eorl]] fell fighting in [[the Wold]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

During these struggles Sauron reclaimed Mordor unnoticed in {{TA|2941}}.

=== War of the Ring ===
Easterlings serving Mordor fought in the [[War of the Ring]] alongside the [[Haradrim]] and [[Variags]]. They appeared in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and the [[Battle of Dale]].

In the [[Fourth Age]] some Easterlings were subdued by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and King [[Éomer]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

== Culture ==
The Easterlings were in general more primitive than [[Gondor]]. They were motivated by [[Sauron]] to hate Gondor and seek its riches. 

Troops mentioned in the Easterling forces aiding Sauron in the Third Age included swordsmen, spearmen, horsemen, mounted archers, and chariots ridden by chieftains.

Some like the Wainriders and the Balchoth had large chariots, wagons and wains which they used to run their foes down, as well as live in and used to fortify their camps.<ref name=cirion/> During the Battle of the [[Pelennor Fields]], Easterlings were bearded and used axes.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
