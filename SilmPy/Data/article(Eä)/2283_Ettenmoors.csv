'''The Ettenmoors''' were a mountainous, wild, and untamed land that lay north of [[Rivendell]].

Also called the '''troll-fells''',<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> the region was likely infested with [[Trolls]].

The Ettenmoors included the land of the [[Ettendales]], which consisted of valleys reaching into the foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 188</ref>

It is speculated that [[Mount Gram]], from where a host of [[Orcs]] [[Battle of Greenfields|attacked]] [[the Shire]], was located in the Ettenmoors.<ref>{{HM|AME}}, pp. 75, 80</ref>
==History==
It was here that in {{TA|1975}} the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] fled after his defeat in the [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] [[Arador]] was slain by trolls in this area<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> in {{TA|2930|n}}.<ref>{{App|North}}</ref>

Around [[November]] {{TA|3018}}, scouts from [[Rivendell]] investigated the Ettenmoors for any activities concerning the servants of [[Sauron]], but they came with no warning news.<ref>{{FR|South}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Ettenmoors'' consists of ''etten'' (derived from [[Old English]] ''eōten'' "[[Giants|giant]], troll") and ''moor'' ("high barren land").<ref name=RC/>

The name ''Ettenmoors'' is similar to the land of [http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Ettinsmoor Ettinsmoor] of [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] by [[C.S. Lewis]].

"Fells" translates to hills or moorland, thus "troll-fells" were hills in which [[trolls]] lived.<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 183</ref>

The first instance of ''troll-fells'' was devoid of a dash and was capitalized, "Trollfells": [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote on a map: "Alter Entish Lands to [Trollfells > Bergrisland >] Ettenmoor". This is also the first mention of Ettenmoor(s) in the legendarium.<ref name="Map">{{TI|Map}}, p. 306</ref>
