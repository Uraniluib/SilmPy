Stoorish was the dialect of [[Westron]] spoken by the [[Stoors|Stoor Hobbits]].

Because of their relative isolation and different route during their [[Wandering Days]], the Stoors borrowed peculiar linguistic manners from the [[Vales of Anduin]] or the [[Angle of Eriador]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

Stoorish characteristics with its [[Dunlendish]] background was retained in [[the Shire]]. Several regional peculiarities could be seen in regions that Stoors mostly settled in (eg. [[Buckland]] and the [[Marish]]). Bucklanders such as the [[Brandybucks]] wore peculiar names apparently derived from the former southern Stoorish.<ref>{{App|Hobbits}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
Tolkien said to the Dutch Translator, [[Max Schuchart]], that there were "'[[Celtic]]' elements in [[Buckland]] and [[Eastfarthing|East-farthing]] names."<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 93</ref>

The Stoors have [[Celtic]] elements in their names reflecting their [[Pre-Númenórean]] background (via the Dunlendings)<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'' "Giving of Names"</ref>. Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the [[Bree-landers|Bree-men]] resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>

'''2001: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:[[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] is described as being the linguistic "oddball" of the group: his accent is noticeably distinct from the other Hobbits seen on-screen, something of an invention between actor [[Dominic Monaghan]] and the dialect coaches, to reflect his unique origin.
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'''''
:In keeping with Tolkien's usage of Celtic for non-[[Westron]] elements, the Stoor characters in Dunland are often seen with [[Welsh]] names.<ref>[http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?375331-Stoorish-names Stoorish names]</ref>
