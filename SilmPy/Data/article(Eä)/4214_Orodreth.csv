'''Orodreth''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[oˈrodreθ]}}), son of [[Angrod]] was a [[Noldo]] and the [[King of Nargothrond]] in the [[First Age]]. His name in [[Quenya]] was '''Artaresto''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌartaˈresto]}}). He was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]].<ref name="Shib">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>

==History==
===Early History===
During the [[Flight of the Noldor]], Orodreth, alone save [[Finarfin]] spoke softly and sought to calm the Noldor.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> After the return of the Noldor to [[Middle-earth]] and the completion of [[Nargothrond]], [[Finrod]] son of Finarfin gave the fortress of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] to Orodreth's keeping.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>
Orodreth held the fortress of Minas Tirith in the vale of [[Sirion]] until [[Sauron]], lieutenant of [[Morgoth]], overran the isle shortly after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and turned it into [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], The Isle of Werewolves, in {{FA|457}}. Orodreth then fled south to [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

===Arrival of Beren===
When [[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]] came to Nargothrond in {{FA|465}}, Finrod, the [[King of Nargothrond]], went with him on his [[Quest for the Silmaril|quest for the Silmaril]], fulfilling his oath. However, [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the [[sons of Fëanor|Sons of Fëanor]], were also at Nargothrond at the time, and forced Finrod to help Beren with [[Edrahil]] and only ten companions, and without the help of the majority of his people. Orodreth took up the crown, ruling as a regent, but the sons of [[Fëanor]] held the real power. Curufin called him "a dullard slow" in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', and with his brother Celegorm plotted to take over Nargothrond if news came of Finrod's death. However when news came that Finrod had been killed and Tol-in-Gaurhoth destroyed, the sons of Fëanor were shamed and fell from power; the people cried out that the maiden [[Lúthien]] had done what the sons of Fëanor dared not. Orodreth returned to power and expelled Celegorm and Curufin from Nargothrond.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Arrival of Túrin===
In {{FA|490}}<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref>, [[Gwindor]], a prince of Nargothrond, and an escaped thrall of Morgoth, returning from his captivity in [[Angband]], led [[Túrin]], son of [[Húrin]], a [[Man]] of the [[House of Hador]] to Nargothrond. In Nargothrond Túrin hid his name, calling himself ''[[Agarwaen]]'', son of ''[[Úmarth]]'' ("Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate"). [[Finduilas]], daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him ''Thurin'' ("The Secret"). He was also called ''Adanedhel'' ("Man-Elf") because he was so alike to an Elf, though he was a Man.<ref name="CH10">{{CH|10}}</ref><ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

His identity did not remain hidden for long. Gwindor revealed to Finduilas that 'Agarwaen' was in fact Túrin, and 'Úmarth' his famous father Húrin. When the news of this reached Finduilas' father, Orodreth, King of Nargothrond, Túrin was given great honor and standing, but the revelation of Túrin's identity would also bring Morgoth's curse with him.<ref name="CH10">{{CH|10}}</ref><ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

Túrin became a chief counselor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the people of Nargothrond to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with [[Gurthang]], his black sword, he himself became known as ''Mormegil'' ("Black Sword").<ref name="CH10">{{CH|10}}</ref><ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

However, sometime after, two messengers, named [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], sent there by [[Círdan]], arrived to Nargothrond, delivering the message from [[Ulmo]], Lord of Waters himself, to the King Orodreth, advising him to shut the doors of Nargothrond and destroy the bridge before its gates. At this time Orodreth relied upon the counsel of Túrin, who scorned the words of the messengers, for it was upon his advice that the bridge had been built and it was his policy for the King's forces to go forth openly to war, and sent them away.<ref name="Fall">{{CH|11}}</ref><ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

This would prove to be a fatal mistake, since in {{FA|495}}<ref>{{GA|275}}</ref>, Morgoth unleashed his forces at Nargothrond and led by [[Glaurung]] the dragon, they devastated the army of Orodreth at the [[Battle of Tumhalad]]. In that battle Orodreth was slain, and after that the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] was inevitable, due to the bridge that allowed Glaurung and Morgoth's host to ravage the city, and most of its people were either enslaved or killed (including Orodreth's daughter Finduilas).<ref name="Fall">{{CH|11}}</ref><ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Orodreth'' is glossed as "mountaineer", containing Sindarin [[ered|orod]] "mountain" and ''reth'' "*climber" (from [[RETE]] "climb").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 182</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier versions of ''The Silmarillion'' legendarium as detailed in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, Orodreth was a more important character, and the original king of Nargothrond. However, his importance diminished over time.

In the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is a son of Finarfin rather than a grandson, with the Quenya name '''Artaresto'''. 

In later versions, [[Gil-galad]], later [[High King of the Noldor]], was Orodreth's son, but in the published ''Silmarillion'' Gil-galad is made into [[Fingon]]'s son instead. An earlier idea was that Orodreth's son was named '''Hallas''', but Gil-galad replaced him. Since this later revision wasn't integrated in any of his father's narratives, [[Christopher Tolkien]] didn't include it in the published text. However, unlike in the matter of Gil-galad, Christopher Tolkien believed that the decision to make Orodreth the son of Angrod was final. 

In his last writings, Tolkien changed Orodreth's name to '''[[Artaher]]''' ([[Quenya]]) / '''Arothir''' ([[Sindarin]]), but it was never introduced in any narratives, so Christopher Tolkien left the name Orodreth unchanged.<ref name="Shib">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>
