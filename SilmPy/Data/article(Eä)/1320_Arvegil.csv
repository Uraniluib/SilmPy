'''Arvegil''' ({{TA|1553}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1743|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 190) was the eleventh king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Argeleb II]], upon his death in 1670.
==History==
During his father's reign, Arvegil saw events that would shape the history of [[Middle-earth]], including the foundation of [[the Shire]]. He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the [[DÃºnedain]]) when the [[Great Plague]] came out of the south and ravaged [[Eriador]], but the seat of the Kings at [[Fornost]] in the north was little affected.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, longer than any of his descendants until [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{PM|Ai}}</ref> By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death. Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father [[Argeleb II]] and his grandfather [[Araphor]].

Arvegil ruled [[Arthedain]] for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as [[Arveleg II]], upon his death in {{TA|1743|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
'''Arvegil''' is [[Sindarin]] for "Royal Sword" from ''[[Ara|ara-]]'' meaning "royal, king", and ''megil'' (becoming [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''vegil'') meaning "sword".
