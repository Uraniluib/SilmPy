'''Dailir''' was the name of the arrow used by [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] with his bow, [[Belthronding]].  After shooting this arrow Beleg always found it unharmed.  However, it was broken at last when Beleg fell upon it when he was carrying [[Túrin]].<ref>{{LB|1c}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''dailir'' is glossed "cleaver" in the Noldorin Word-lists, and is related to the [[Noldorin]] verb ''daila-'' "to cleave" and the noun ''dail'' "axe-blade". The ''-ir'' suffix creates an "agent noun" (such as adding 'r' to 'bite' in English produces 'biter').<ref>{{PE|13}} p. 141</ref><ref>{{HH|Death}}, note 6, p. 564</ref>
