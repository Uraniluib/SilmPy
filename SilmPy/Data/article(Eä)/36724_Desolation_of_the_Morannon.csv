The '''Desolation of the Morannon''' was the dead land that lay just before walls of [[Mordor]] south of the [[Dagorlad]]. The terrible barrenness of the landscape was due to the labours of [[Sauron]]'s slaves, who had so defiled the land that it was diseased beyond repair. It was a foul place of horror for absolutely nothing grew in the polluted soil.  Pools of water were choked with ash and muds, slag-mounds of crushed and powered rock abounded, and cones of earth fire-blasted and stained with poison rose as if they were part of a graveyard.  <ref>{{TT|IV2}}</ref>

[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], led by [[Gollum]], reached the Desolation of the Morannon on [[4 March]], {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
