'''Haysend''' was the village at the southern tip of [[Buckland]], at the place where the River [[Withywindle]] flowed out of the [[Old Forest]] into the [[Brandywine]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> It was named for the fact that it stood at the end of the [[High Hay]], the Hedge raised to protect the Bucklanders from the strange things that lived in the Forest and beyond it. 

According to the poem "[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]", its inhabitants had a more fierce and protective attitude than most [[Hobbits]], which is hardly surprising given the perilous location of their village.<ref>{{ATB|Preface}}</ref>
