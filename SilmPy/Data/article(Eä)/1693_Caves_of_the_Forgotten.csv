The '''Caves of the Forgotten''' were formed after the hills of [[Calacirya]] fell on the army led by the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] King [[Ar-Pharazôn]]. 

Seduced by [[Sauron]], he was persuaded that he had the power to take the lands of [[Aman]] from the [[Valar]] themselves. He set out with a great fleet and led an immense army into the [[Calacirya]], ready to do battle for the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]] itself. 

At that time [[Manwë]] the Elder King gave up his power over [[Arda]] and called on [[Ilúvatar]], who then broke the world. Their fleets and even their island home were swept away.  

Meanwhile, they themselves were imprisoned beneath the Earth where they still await the ending of the world. When the day of the [[Last Battle]] comes, it is said, they will be released from their caves, though the part that they have to play in the battle remains a mystery.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
