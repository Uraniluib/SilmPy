==Etymology==
Marhari is a [[Gothic]] name meaning 'horse-soldier'. The first element is related to English "mare" (see ''[[mearas]]'').<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 6</ref> The second  element ''-hari'' is a simplified version of [[Gothic]] ''-harya'' "armyman, warrior" (seen also in [[Vinitharya]]) to indicate a later age. 

In [[Old English]] this element became ''-here'' and is seen in the later [[Rohirric]] name [[Dúnhere]] which translates as "hill warrior".
