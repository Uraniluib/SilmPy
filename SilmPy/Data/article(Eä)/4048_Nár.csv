'''Nár''' was an old [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], the sole companion of King [[Thrór]] when he set out to wander in the wilds of [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Virtually nothing is known of Nár. However what is known is that he set out with the King of Durin’s folk from [[Dunland]], where the Thrór's following of relatives and subjects were living at the time to find his fortunes in wider world.
Their journey eventually brought them to the old [[Dwarves|dwarf]]-halls of [[Moria]], now infested with [[Orcs]] and [[Trolls]]. Disregarding the pleas of Nár, Thrór insisted on entering [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] while Nár stayed behind and waited for the king not far from the gate. 

That was the last any Dwarf ever saw of Thrór alive. He was beheaded by the Orcs, and their chieftain [[Azog]] branded his own name on Thrór's brow. The Orcs allowed Nár to live so he could return to Thrór's son [[Thráin|Thráin II]], with a message that Azog now ruled in Moria, and that Dwarves best stay away lest they suffer the same fate. 

Nár returned to Dunland where his message caused such anger amongst his people that it raised a call to arms among all seven Dwarf Houses to avenge the elder high-king of their race, leading the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. 
In the climactic [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], Azog himself was slain along with thousands of others on both sides.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Nár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means "Corpse".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
