'''Ent-draughts''' were the mysterious and potent waters consumed by the [[Ents]] which [[Treebeard]] shared with the [[hobbits]] in the [[Wellinghall]]. 

Though little is known about them in detail, they seem to have been made from river-water, but with unique and subtle flavours reflecting the Ents' association with trees and forests.  The first time [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] imbibed an ent-draught it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood brought from afar by a cool night breeze.  The second time they drank the flavour was earthier and richer, more food-like.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

Their power of growth was most evident when they were drunk by beings other than Ents: the Ent-draughts taken by Merry and Pippin added three inches or more to their heights,<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref> making them the tallest [[Hobbits]] in the history of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>
