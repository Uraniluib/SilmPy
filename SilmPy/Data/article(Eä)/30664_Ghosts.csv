'''Ghosts''' was a name commonly used to describe the [[undead]], beings which did not perish after what would be a natural death, but which continued to haunt the living in their after-life. While likely often the product of a vivid imagination, the dealings of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] with several types of undead testify that ghosts were a reality in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref>

In the late [[Third Age]], the ruined and deserted [[Osgiliath]] was known as "''a city of ghosts.''"<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

==Names==

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "a ghost" is ''Ã»l''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 62, 74</ref>
