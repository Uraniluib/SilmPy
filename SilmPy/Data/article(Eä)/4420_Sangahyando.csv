'''Sangahyando''' was a great-grandson of [[Castamir]], who had usurped the throne of [[Gondor]]. After the rightful King, [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], had regained his realm, Castamir's sons fled to the [[Umbar]], where they formed a refuge and base for the enemies of Gondor. Sangahyando was one of their descendants, and with another, [[Angamaitë]], he led a raid on [[Pelargir]] nearly two hundred years after their grandfathers had been driven from that city into exile. Their raid was a stunning success, and they succeeded in slaying Gondor's King at that time, [[Minardil]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Minardil, p. 199</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Quenya]] name ''Sangahyando'' literally means "Throng-cleaver" (said to be interpretable as "hewer of hostile ranks"). The first element in the name is ''sanga'' ("throng").<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 116</ref>

In the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name was misprinted as ''Sangahyanda''.<ref name=PE17/>
