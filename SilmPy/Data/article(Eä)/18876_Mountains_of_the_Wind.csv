The '''Mountains of the Wind''' was, according to the [[Ambarkanta]], a range of mountains in the middle of the [[Middle-earth]] to the west of [[Hildórien]]. It was thus named because of the strong winds "coming from the East before the Sun". The Mountains of the Wind are no more mentioned in the later versions of the [[legendarium]].

In the [[Ambarkanta maps]], the Mountains of the Wind are not shown on Map V, labelled ''"After the [[War for the Sake of the Elves|War of the Gods]]"''.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 239, 248 (map), 257.</ref>
