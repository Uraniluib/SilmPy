__NOTOC__

'''''únati''''') is a [[Quenya]] noun meaning "a thing impossible to be or to be done".<ref name=O>{{VT|39b}}</ref> The term refers to physical laws established by [[Ilúvatar]] that are impossible to break. The ''únati'' contrast with the ''[[axan]]i'', which are laws established by Ilúvatar that lesser beings should not, but can, disobey. [[Melkor]] refused to accept any ''axani'' as binding upon him, but much to his frustration, he was unable to violate the ''únati''.<ref name=O />
