'''Calmindon''' was a tower built upon [[Tol Uinen]], an island in the long bay of [[Rómenna]] that ran into the eastern coastlands of [[Númenor]]. The island was sacred to [[Uinen]] herself, and it was here that the [[Guild of Venturers]] often berthed their guild-ship [[Eämbar]]. The captain of the Guild, [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]], built a tall tower on the island as a warning to ships in the bay. He called this tower Calmindon, a name which is simply [[Elvish]] for 'Light-tower'.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
