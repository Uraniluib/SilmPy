'''Pincup''' was a small village of [[the Shire]]. It lay in the northern corner of the [[Southfarthing]], some miles south of the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], in that hilly part of the Shire known as the [[Green Hill Country]]. It seems to have been built in the southern slopes of the [[Green Hills]], and was reached by only a single road, apparently leading from the larger settlement of [[Longbottom]] to the south.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Concerning the origin of Pincup's name, the first element is ''pinnuc'' or ''pink'', finch or sparrow, and the second element is ''hop'', recess, retreat.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. lix</ref>

Before the above publication, [[David Salo]] had suggested a derivation from a speculative [[Old English]] *''Pincopp'' "pine-hill", among other possibilities.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
