'''Doderic Brandybuck''' was a Hobbit of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Doderic was a son of [[Seredic Brandybuck]] and [[Hilda Bracegirdle]]. He attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Since it belongs to a [[Brandybuck]], the name is [[Celtic]]-sounding. However it is perhaps a form of Germanic [[Wikipedia:Theuderic|Theuderic]] meaning "people reign".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>
