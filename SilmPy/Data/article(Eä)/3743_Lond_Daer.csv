'''Lond Daer Enedh''' (also spelt '''Ened''') was a great harbour in [[Eriador]] founded by the [[Númenóreans]].

Lond Daer, under the name '''Vinyalondë''', or "New Haven", was founded by [[Númenor]]'s crown prince [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] on the estuary of the river [[Gwathló]] between {{SA|750}} and {{SA|800|n}}.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Notes, ''Chronology''</ref> It was the first permanent settlement of the Númenóreans in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> From here Aldarion's [[Guild of Venturers]] began harvesting the local timber for the ship-building industry of Númenor. It was one of their primary shipyards, fed with their reckless cutting of trees.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #69</ref>

Within a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] became cataclysmic, angering the local native population (ancestors of the [[Dunlendings]]), and they began to fight back with increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and frequently burning the great wood-stores in "hit-and-run" attacks.<ref name="6d">{{UT|6d}}</ref>

By the time of the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] in the middle of the [[Second Age]], this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its name had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to '''Lond Daer''', the "Great Haven". As such, it was one of the two beachheads of the Númenórean forces in Eriador that were used to support the [[Elves]] around {{SA|1700}}.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

Lond Daer's shipyards were starved of timber following the war, as the forces of [[Sauron]] had burnt almost all of what remained in [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]]. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, Lond Daer declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south, [[Pelargir]] and [[Umbar]]. Following this, Lond Daer was once again renamed, being now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as [[Lond Daer Enedh]], or "Great Middle Haven". Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic on the [[Gwathló]] as far as the city of [[Tharbad]].<ref name="6d"/>

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], [[Elendil]] founded the realm of [[Arnor]] in the lands north of Lond Daer, but the haven was now redundant, and fell into ruin. Instead, control over the region was maintained from [[Tharbad]]. The ancient ruins of Lond Daer were still visible as late as the end of the [[Third Age]], however, and still featured on maps from that time.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>
