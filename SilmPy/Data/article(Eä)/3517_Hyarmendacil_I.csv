'''Hyarmendacil I''', born '''Ciryaher''', was the fifteenth [[King of Gondor]].
==History==
Ciryaher was the son of King [[Ciryandil]], one of the [[Ship-kings]].

The [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]], to the far south of Gondor, had been captured by Ciryaher's grandfather [[Eärnil I]], but had since proved difficult to hold. Ciryandil was slain during a siege of the Haven by the [[Haradrim]] and Ciryaher ascended the throne. He began his reign by reorganizing Gondor's armies and in {{TA|1050}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> he openly declared war on and conquered the men of [[Harad]] who acknowledged the overlordship of Gondor. After this victory he took the name ''Hyarmendacil'', meaning "South-victor".<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Hyarmendacil's reign brought [[Gondor]] to its greatest extent and power.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> For the rest of his one hundred and thirty-four year reign Gondor was at peace; the passes of [[Mordor]] were well guarded, and no one dared contest his power.

Hyarmendacil was the last of the [[Ship-kings]]. He was succeeded by his lazy son [[Atanatar II|Atanatar II Alcarin]].
