The '''House of the Harp''' was one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim]], led by [[Salgant]].  Its people were brave warriors, and were dight with tassels of silver and of gold, and a harp of silver shone in their blazonry upon a field of black, though Salgant bore one of gold.  They resisted their treacherous lord's orders during the [[Fall of Gondolin]] and deserted to aid [[Glorfindel of Gondolin|Glorfindel]] and the [[House of the Golden Flower]] at the [[Great Market]].  They drove the enemy back into the market as the [[Orcs]] pursued Glorfindel, but they were leaderless, and many of them were trapped burned to death or poisoned by the breath of the [[Dragons]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
