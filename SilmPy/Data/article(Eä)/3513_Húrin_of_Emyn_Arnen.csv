}}'''Húrin of Emyn Arnen''' was the first recorded [[Steward of Gondor]]. 

==History==
Húrin came from the hill region of [[Emyn Arnen]] and of noble [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent. Being a noble of high trust and wisdom, he was chosen to serve under King [[Minardil]] as [[Steward of Gondor]].<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> During his service, Húrin laboured greatly on Gondor's behalf in the days of the [[Great Plague]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> 

Minardil's heirs opted to select their own Stewards not from any noble [[Gondorians]], but from Húrin's sons and descendants; thus Stewardship was connected to the [[House of Húrin]], and [[Pelendur|after some generations]] it became hereditary.<ref name="Stewards"/>
