'''Lake-town''', also known as '''Esgaroth upon the Long Lake''', was the township of the [[Lake-men]] in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. 

==Description==
The town was constructed entirely of wood and stood upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the [[Long Lake]], as a protection against the dragon [[Smaug]], who dwelt nearby in the [[Lonely Mountain]].

It was situated on the west side of the lake, north of the mouth of the [[Forest River]] in a calm bay that was formed by the shelter of a rock promontory. A long wooden bridge connected the town to the land, ending in a building, with guards watching over the entrance.

In the middle of Lake-town the central market-place was located, which was a round pool connected to the lake by a tunnel<ref name="fire">{{H|14}}</ref>. The greatest houses of Lake-town were around this market-place, from which ramps descended to the water<ref name="h10">{{H|10}}</ref>. The edge of the town was occupied with quays and, again, ramps, which descended to the water.<ref>The tunnel, the bridge and the ramps are visible in Tolkien's drawing.</ref><ref name="Fonstad"/>

==History==
It is not known when Lake-town was built. The name ''Esgaroth'' is mentioned on [[Thrór's Map]], and is said to be an older name, known while Smaug was younger<ref>{{H|12}}</ref>. When [[Bilbo Baggins]] came to the town, he noticed old pilings of a (possibly older) greater town along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.<ref name="h10"/> It's possible that an original Esgaroth was destroyed sometime in the past, and the later '''Lake-town''' was its remnant.<ref name="Fonstad">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', The Hobbit - Lake-town</ref>

The Lake-town was occupied by the [[Lake-men]], descendants of the survivors of the former Kingdom of [[Dale]], like [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], whose ancestor was its last lord, [[Girion]]. However as the years passed, Smaug was forgotten and children even doubted about his existence or the tales of older men who sometimes had seen him flying.<ref name="h10"/>

In the autumn of {{TA|2941}} [[Thorin and Company]] escaped from [[Thranduil]]'s halls and [[Thorin|Thorin]] followed by [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and Bilbo decided to enter the town and speak to the [[Master of Lake-town|Master]]. The Dwarves were welcomed warmly because the Lake-men were eager to have the [[King under the Mountain]] return. The Dwarves and Bilbo were hosted, rested and pampered before being sent with boats to the ruins of [[Dale]] to confront the dragon.

Some days later, however, the town was attacked by [[Smaug]], but [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], who had indirectly learned of a weakness in Smaug's armour, slew the dragon with the [[Black Arrow]]. The town was wrecked by the dragon who fell dead on it and sunk in the lake. Survivors managed to sail to the lakeshore with boats and camped there<ref name="fire"/>. 

Thorin refused to share Smaug's treasure and declared war on both the Lake-men and the Elves. The conflict eventually exploded because they heard news of approaching [[Wargs]] and [[Orcs|Goblins]]. Thus began the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. 

The town was afterwards rebuilt to the north of its former location, using some of the treasure. The town's Master ran off with some of the gold. Part of the town's population followed Bard to resettle the Kingdom of [[Dale]].

By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Lake-town was part of the kingdom of Dale under [[Bard II]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Esgaroth.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Esgaroth'' was seemingly not given a clear etymology in any of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s later writings. A manuscript written after ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' states that ''Esgaroth'' was "not ''Sindarin'' (though perhaps 'Sindarized' in shape)", similarly to the name ''[[Galion#Etymoloy|Galion]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 54</ref>

In earlier manuscripts, at least two interpretations of the name ''Esgaroth'' appeared:
#Deriving from the root-word ''[[esgar]]'', meaning "reed-bed" in [[Ilkorin|Ilkorin Elvish]]. The whole name ''Esgaroth'' translates as "…Reedlake, because of reed-banks in west".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 356 (entry [[ESEK]])</ref>
#Translated as "[?][[Uncommon words#S|strand]]-[[Uncommon words#cite_ref-LT2_0-0|burg]]", from ''esgar'' "shore" (not given any designated language).<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 14</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Esgaroth is featured as a level.{{fact}}

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Lake-town is run by a heavily corrupt Master, aided by [[Alfrid]]. While the other Dwarves set out for Erebor, [[Kíli]], [[Fíli]], [[Dori]] and [[Óin]] stay behind with [[Bard]]'s children [[Bain]], [[Sigrid]] and [[Tilda]] to tend to Kíli's arrow wound. Orc raiders assail the town, but they are repelled by the Dwarves, [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]]. Tauriel heals Kíli with [[athelas]].

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:The town is destroyed by Smaug, who attacks it as revenge for helping Bilbo and the Dwarves. The remaining Dwarves escape on a barge with Tauriel's help. Bard (with Bain's help) kills Smaug with a windlass. His falling corpse kills the Master and all on his barge.

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The rebuilt Lake-town is a major travel point for adventurers in the North, situated further up the Lake from the old Lake-town. The watery ruins of Esgaroth-of-old (the former Lake-town) are still intact on the [[Long Lake]], with the Bones of [[Smaug]] resting on the remains. A band of brigands pilfer the location for valuables as well as Smaug's Bones.
