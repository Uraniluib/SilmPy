'''Nurn''' was the name given to the southern regions of [[Mordor]], more fertile than [[Plateau of Gorgoroth|Gorgoroth]] in the north, in which the great inland [[Sea of Núrnen]] lay.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> The people who inhabited Nurn were [[Men]] and there may have been prisoners of war there as well. These people were enslaved by [[Sauron]], working the soil around the sea of Nurn to feed Sauron's armies.

After the [[War of the Ring]], King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] liberated the peoples of Nurn and gave them the land as their own. The southern region of Nurn probably escaped the destruction caused in northern Mordor by the eruption of [[Orodruin|Mount Doom]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
