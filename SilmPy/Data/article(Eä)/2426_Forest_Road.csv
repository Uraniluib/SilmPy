The '''Forest Road''' was the road that ran down from the [[High Pass]], crossed the River [[Anduin]] and then plunged among the trees of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] (later called [[Mirkwood]]). It followed a nearly straight course through the central parts of the forest, somewhat to the south of the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]], and emerged on the banks of the River [[River Running|Running]].  In ancient times the road was actually extended all the way up to the [[Iron Hills]], but after a while the road fell into disrepair, and the [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] lost contact with the capital of [[Moria|Khazad-d√ªm]].

The original route planned for the [[Quest of Erebor]] was to cross Mirkwood using the Forest Road.  However, the Dwarves had been dwelling in the [[Blue Mountains]] in the west for many decades and were not well informed of recent developments in the area.  When the company arrived at the house of [[Beorn]], however, he informed them that the eastern portions of the road had fallen into such bad disrepair that the route was impassible.  Instead, [[Beorn]] advised them of a [[Elf-path|secret path]] made by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] that ran across northern Mirkwood.
