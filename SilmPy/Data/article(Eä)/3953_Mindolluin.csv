'''Mindolluin''' or '''Mount Mindolluin''' was the easternmost peak of the Ered Nimrais ([[White Mountains]]), below and to the east of which stood the city of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

There was an ancient steep path into the southern foothills of Mindolluin, leading to a high hallow far above the city where only the [[Kings of Gondor]] visited. Standing in this spot one could look over a precipice to the towers of the city far below.

Shortly after [[Aragorn]]'s coronation as Elessar, on [[25 June]]<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref><ref group=note>The date is problematic, as the narrative in the chapter ''[[The Steward and the King]]'' suggests that the sapling was planted ''before'' June.</ref>, [[Gandalf]] took him by the forgotten path to the high hallow where the newly crowned king could view the vastness of his realm. When he remarked that the [[White Tree of Gondor]] in the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] was still [[Dead Tree|withered]], Gandalf bade him to turn about. Opposite the precipice was an otherwise barren stony slope upon which one growing thing could be seen, a sapling of the line of [[Nimloth of NÃºmenor|Nimloth]]. Aragorn removed the tree and brought it to the Citadel for planting as a sign of rebirth, and for [[Arwen]] to come to [[Gondor]] and be his queen.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>
