'''Fram''' was the son of [[Frumgar]]<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> and the fifth [[Lord of the Éothéod]].

==History==
During his rule the [[Éothéod]] lived at the feet of the [[Grey Mountains]] where they were troubled by the [[Long-worms|Dragon]] [[Scatha]]. Fram slew the monster and claimed the Dragon's hoard as his own. The [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|Dwarves of that region]] also laid claim to the treasure, but Fram rebuked the claim, instead sending them the teeth of the Dragon along with the message, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." The rebuke angered the Dwarves, and it was rumoured that they killed Fram for it.<ref name="Eorl"/>

The city of [[Framsburg]] was named after him.
