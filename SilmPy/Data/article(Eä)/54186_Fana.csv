'''''Fana''''' is a [[Quenya]] term used to describe the physical form which is taken on by the [[Ainur]] when they desire to have tangible bodies.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref> Unlike the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] the Ainur take on ''[[Fëa and hröa|hröar]]'' by choice, wearing or going without physical form as mortals wear or can go without clothing.<ref name=ai>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> Being inherently spiritual beings, ''[[ëalar]]'', they did not need material bodies to be whole in that fashion that ''[[fëar]]'', the spiritual component of [[Incarnate|Incarnates]], need to be joined with ''[[Fëa and hröa|hröar]]''.<ref name=MR>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 165 (commentary on §18)</ref> 

Most of the Ainur choose to have a body, and when they do take on a physical form it is known as a ''fana''. Although the Ainur are angelic beings of spirit, they each possess a specific gender, male or female, and this gender is part of who they are regardless of whether or not they take on a ''fana''. When they do take on a physical form it is a representation of their gender. [[Manwë|Manwë Súlimo]], for example, takes for himself a ''fana'' in the form of a male, that of a great king. His wife, [[Varda|Varda Elentári]] clothes herself with the ''fana'' in the form of a great and beautiful queen. 

Although most of the Ainur do assume a physical body, some of the them, such as [[Ulmo]] rarely assume a physical form. Sometimes an Ainu can be hurt or injured to the point they are limited or unable to assume a physical form. After [[Sauron]] was caught in the [[Downfall of Númenor|destruction of Númenor]] he was unable to ever take on a fair form again, and after his loss of [[The One Ring]] at the end of the [[Second Age]] he was not able to take any physical shape for many years.
