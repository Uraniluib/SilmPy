'''Valaróma''' was the fabled hunting-horn of [[Oromë]], the [[Huntsman of the Valar]]. It could be heard above all other horns, for its sound was like lightning cleaving the clouds,<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> and its echoes made the [[shadow]]s flee, even [[Melkor]] quail in [[Utumno]].<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>  When the [[Sindar]] heard it they knew that once again the hunter was pursuing the servants of [[Morgoth]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>  Only once did the sound of Valaróma falter - in the Cloud of [[Ungoliant]] after she had attacked the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>
