'''Durin III''' (mid [[Second Age]]) was a King of [[Durin's folk]] who ruled the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. 

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves |Father of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name="Durin"/>

During his reign in the 16th century of the Second Age, the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm had struck a rare friendship with the [[Elves]] of [[Ost-in-Edhil]] in [[Eregion]].  Around {{SA|1500}} the Elves, guided by [[Annatar]], began forging the [[Rings of Power]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  According to the Dwarves, [[Celebrimbor]] gave Durin the first of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Rings of the Dwarves]]<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> (other traditions state that it was Sauron who bestowed all seven of these Rings).<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>  [[Ring of Thrór|This ring]] would later come to [[Thráin|Thráin II]]'s possession until it was taken by Sauron.<ref name="Durin"/>

Their instructor in crafting the Rings, the wise [[Annatar]], was actually [[Sauron]] who had come to corrupt the Elves through the Rings of Power. By {{SA|1697}}, seeing that he could not control either the Elves nor the Dwarves through the Rings, he led a large army towards Eregion. In response Durin sent a great force of Dwarves to protect the [[Doors of Durin]], but with the [[Sack of Eregion|fall of Eregion]] his warriors withdrew and the gates to the city were shut, sealing the kingdom off from the outside world.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Not much can be said about Durin's later reign. It is said that the Dwarf Lords who possessed the Rings of Power saw their natural skills amplified, and desired dominion. They became also more greedy and became rich. But otherwise they proved resistant to their malevolent [[magic]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
