'''''chwind''''', alternatively '''''whinn''''', are [[Sindarin]] words meaning "[[Birches|birch]]" (the [[Quenya]] equivalent was ''[[hwinde]]''). The words were used in an 'ordinary non-mythological' sense, in contrast to the word ''[[Brethil (Sindarin word)|brethil]]''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 23</ref>
