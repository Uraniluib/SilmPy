'''Dáin's halls''' was a name used for the halls that formed the capital of the [[Grey Mountains]], the name coming from the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]-king [[Dáin I]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
The Halls of Dáin were probably originally founded by the first exiled dwarves from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] who had fled the city because of the [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. However because there is no information on the halls, it can only be assumed that it was the capital of Durin's folk at the time.

In {{TA|2589}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Dáin was killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|Cold-Drake]] along with his son [[Frór]] at the entrance to the city. A year later, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the mountains, and left for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin"/>

It is possible that either under [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II's]] or [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III's]] reign that this city was retaken.
