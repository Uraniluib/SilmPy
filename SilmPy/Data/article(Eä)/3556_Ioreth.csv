}}'''Ioreth''' was a woman of [[Gondor]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
Ioreth was originally from [[Imloth Melui]] in [[Lossarnach]], but moved to [[Minas Tirith]] and worked in the [[Houses of Healing]]. By {{TA|3019}} she was the oldest woman working there and was well versed in old lore, which helped restore the health of [[Faramir]].  She was very talkative, which annoyed [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ioreth'' means "old woman" in [[Sindarin]]; ''[[iaur]]'' "old" plus feminine ending ''[[-eth]]''. In draft, Tolkien had spelt her name ''Yoreth''.<ref name=Joukes>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to a Mr. Joukes dated August 28, 1967]]", published in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 579</ref>

Like "[[Gamling]]", it was specifically chosen to suit the character of the old nurse.<ref name=Joukes/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1956: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)]]'':'''
:[[Prunella Scales]] is credited as Ioreth in the fifth episode of the second run, "Minas Tirith and Mount Doom".<ref name="RT1727">Radio Times, Volume 133, No. 1727, [[14 December|December 14]], [[1956]]</ref> As Scales was in her twenties at the time, it is unknown to what extent the "old lady" aspect was used.

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Pat Franklyn]] is credited as "The Old Woman". She is not referred to as Ioreth at any time, but her lines are lifted from Ioreth's.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]], "[[The Sword That Was Broken... New Forged]]"</ref>

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
