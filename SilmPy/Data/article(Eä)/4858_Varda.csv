'''Varda Elentári''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈvarda ˌelenˈtaːri]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈβarda ˌelenˈtaːri]}}), known in [[Sindarin]] as '''Elbereth Gilthoniel''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈelbereθ ɡilˈθonjel]}}), was a [[Valar|Valië]], one of the [[Aratar]], the wife of [[Manwë]] and Queen of the Valar. 

Varda knows all the regions of [[Eä]] and rejoices in light. She was said to be too beautiful for words as within her face radiated the light of [[Ilúvatar]]. Elves love and revere her most of all the Valar, and they call upon her in their hours of deepest darkness.<ref name=vala/> She appeared in shining white ''[[fana]]'' in visions to the Elves of Middle-earth, and thus was called [[Fanuilos]] (Snow-white).<ref>{{RGEO|7}}, p. 74</ref>

Her handmaiden is [[Ilmarë]], a Chief of the [[Maiar]] but [[Gandalf|Olórin]] also served her.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Varda and Manwë in Valinor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Varda and Manwë in Valinor'']]
When [[Morgoth|Melkor]] first began to create his discord, Varda saw his mind, and despised him. Melkor feared and hated Varda the most out of the Valar. In the beginning Melkor had been unable to control light, which Varda was most associated with. When [[Manwë]] [[First War|contested]] with him for [[Arda]], Varda came from the deeps of Eä to his side.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> The Maiar Ilmarë and Olorin were affiliated with her.

During the [[Spring of Arda]], she filled the [[Two Lamps]] with light.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> After their destruction at the hands of Melkor, Varda and the rest of the Ainur forsook the outer lands and removed to Aman. 

She resided with [[Manwë]] in [[Ilmarin]] and aids him in the rule of [[Arda]]. With her, Manwë sees beyond all eyes, through mist and darkness, and with him, Varda can hear all voices from every corner of the world.<ref name=vala/> In [[Valinor]] she kept the dews of the [[Two Trees]] in the [[Wells of Varda]]. When Mandos foretold of the coming of the Elves and how they would always look to Varda in reverence, she took it upon herself to set new stars for the Elves to see when they awakened. She created the newer stars with the dews from the vats of [[Telperion]], the first of the [[Two Trees]], in preparation for [[Awakening of the Elves]]. The set of stars she made was known as the Sickle of the Valar. This was said to be the greatest labour of the Valar since the beginning of time, and when the Elves awoke in Middle-earth they beheld first the stars which Varda had made. For this, Varda is the Vala most loved and revered by the [[Elves]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref><ref name=vala/>

She also hallowed the [[Silmarils]] of [[Fëanor]] when he created them, so that any being or creature of evil could never handle them without being burned.<ref>{{S|7}}</ref> After the death of the Two Trees, Varda was tasked once again with filling the world with a new light. Therefore she took the remaining flower of Telperion and the fruit of Laurelin and placed them in vessels made by Aulë. Varda bequeathed to them such light and power that they outshone the ancient stars. In doing so, she established the courses of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref> Initially she purposed the Sun and the Moon to be in the sky together, but Irmo and Estë pointed out that she had deprived the world of night-time and the stars, which was still necessary for rest and sleep. Therefore Varda changed her counsel and altered the courses of the Sun so that it should spend a certain time hidden, allowing for the stars to be seen again. At the end of the [[First Age]], she placed [[Eärendil]] [[Star of Eärendil|as a star]] in the sky.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

In [[Middle-earth]], she was revered by the Elves who called her name and sung hymns to her (such as the [[Elven Hymn to Elbereth]]) and perhaps answered to prayers, even to [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{TT|Lair}}</ref> The very mention of her name was said to be deadly to evil spirits, such as when Frodo uttered the name in the presence of the Morgul Lord.

==Etymology==
''Varda'' is a [[Quenya]] name,<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 82</ref> meaning "sublime" or "lofty", from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''[[baradâ]]'', merged with ''[[barathî]]''.{{fact}} In [[Telerin]], this name is translated as ''[[Baradis]]''.

In [[Sindarin]], Varda is called ''Elbereth'', which derives from ''[[elen]]-[[bereth]]'' meaning "star-queen" and represents evolution of [[Primitive Quendian]] *''[[elen]]-[[barathî]]'' (the final ''-i'' [[i-affection|umlauted]] the word to ''berethi'') > ''elemberethi'' > ''elbereth''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Donald Swann]], ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', "[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]"</ref>

All of these names come from the [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[BARAT|BARÁD/BARATH]].<ref name=Ety351>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 351</ref>

In [[Adûnaic]], Varda's name is adapted rather than translated, becoming '''Avradî'''.

Varda's titles and epithets include ''The Kindler'', ''Lady of the Stars'', ''Queen of the Stars'', and ''Snow-white''. In [[Quenya]] these are ''[[Elentári]]'' "Star-queen", ''[[Tintallë]]'' "Star-kindler", and '''''[[Airë]] [[Tári]]''''' the "holy queen"<ref name=Shibb>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 363-4 (note 45)</ref>, in [[Sindarin]] '''Gilthoniel''' (Starkindler) and '''[[Fanuilos]]''' (Ever-white), and in [[Adûnaic]] '''Gimilnitîr''' "starkindler".

Some older forms of her name are ''Baráda, Bridhil, Timbridhil'' and ''Tinwetári''.{{fact}}

===Other versions of the legendarium===
In Tolkien's early [[Qenya]], ''Vard-'' was a root referring to royalty. Related words were ''vardar'' "king" and ''vardo'' "prince"; they do not appear in the later inception of Quenya.

==Inspiration==
The Valar, being divine beings below the ultimate Creator, [[Ilúvatar]], are thought of as being the [[Middle-earth]] equivalent of saints and angels; it has therefore been suggested that Varda, in her role as the most loved and prayed-to Vala, may be an equivalent of the Virgin Mary in Tolkien's own Catholic faith. Another suggestion is the goddess of wisdom, [[Wikipedia:Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], also associated with the stars.<ref>Rose Thomas, "Is Varda the Wisdom of Eru?", in ''[[Amon Hen]]'' 245, pp. 15-6</ref>
