'''Paladin Took II''' was the thirty-first [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]]. He was the father of [[Peregrin Took]].

==History==
===Family===
Paladin was born in {{SR|1333}} being the only son, and fourth child, of [[Adalgrim Took]], and a great-grandchild of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. He married [[Eglantine Banks]], and they had four children together, three daughters and a son. The eldest was [[Pearl Took|Pearl]] (born {{SR|1375|n}}) followed by [[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]] ({{SR|1379|n}}) and [[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]] ({{SR|1385|n}}). Their youngest child was [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] ({{SR|1390|n}}), who would be Paladin's heir.<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref>

===Becoming Thain===
Paladin was a direct descendent of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], but not in a direct line.<ref name="Took"/> He became a farmer, farming the lands around [[Whitwell]] near [[Tuckborough]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> Never did he expect to become Thain as the Thainship had passed to the descendants of the Old Took's second son, [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]]. Isumbras's grandson [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]] died without an heir in {{SR|1415}}, so the Thainship passed to Paladin, his nearest male-line relative, who was the grandson of the Old Took's third son [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]].<ref name="L214">{{L|214}}</ref> 

===War of the Ring===
Paladin never agreed with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' attempt to take over [[the Shire]] as he believed that if anyone were going to the "Chief" it should be the legitimate [[Thain of the Shire]], therefore Paladin and the other Tooks stood up to Lotho and his [[Ruffians]]. The [[Took Family|Took]]s hid in their deep dwellings of [[Great Smials]], and the ruffians could not get them, and if any ruffians were found in the [[Tookland]] they were shot and killed, an act which led the ruffians to become harsher.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

At this time, Paladin's son [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] and [[Travellers|three other hobbits]], were lost in the [[Old Forest]] by all accounts. Their return was unexpected, but Paladin fully embraced their suggestion to drive out the Ruffians. He sent a hundred Tooks with his son to the [[Battle of Bywater]], and commanded the remainder of his troops cleaning up the area south of the village.<ref name="Scouring"/>

===Death===
Paladin died in {{SR|1434}} at the age of 101, and after having been Thain for nineteen years, he was succeeded by his son who became Thain Peregrin I.<ref name="Took"/>

==Etymology==
A "[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was noble office held by a honourable and valiant knight. In particular, a paladin was one of the twelve peers of Charlemagne's court. The term comes from the Latin ''palatinus'' which means "of the palace".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>
