'''Celon''' was a tributary of the [[Aros]] that rose in the highlands around [[Himring]] and flowed south-westwards until it met the Aros on the southern borders of [[Doriath]].  The woods of [[Nan Elmoth]] lay on its south-western bank, and the river marked the boundary between [[Himlad]] and [[Estolad]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  The Celon was not a great river and was referred to as a "slender stream".<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

==History==
In the years of darkness before the [[return of the Noldor]] the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]] established camps between Celon and [[Gelion]], from which they plundered widely throughout [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>  After the Noldor had returned they created new realms; on the north flank of the Celon [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] established themselves in [[Himlad]] while to the south lay the domains of [[Amrod]] and [[Amros]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

When the people of [[Bëor]] came to Beleriand, [[Finrod Felagund]] advised them to gather and settle upon the east banks of the Celon.  Thereafter the land was called [[Estolad]], which meant the "Encampment".<ref name=West>{{S|West}}</ref>

After the death of [[Haldad]] and the rescue of the [[Haladin]] by [[Caranthir]], the new leader, [[Haleth]], led her people to Estolad where they dwelt for a time.  Later though she removed her people westward to the [[Forest of Brethil]].<ref name=West/>

After the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the Orcs returned, coming down the Celon to encompass Doriath.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Celon'' means the "stream flowing down from heights".<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Celon''</ref>  The name was derived from ''et-kelē'', the "issue of water, spring".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''kel-''</ref>
