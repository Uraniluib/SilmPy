The '''Chubb Family''' was a family of [[Shire-hobbits]], of whom several were present at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]].<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref> Their main connection with the [[Baggins Family|Baggins]] family was through Bilbo's grandfather, the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], whose wife [[Adamanta Chubb]] was mother to no fewer than twelve children, including Bilbo's mother [[Belladonna Took|Belladonna]].

Marriage into the [[Took]] and [[Baggins]] families, as well as the usage of exotic flower names and jewels, suggest that the Chubbs were of higher class.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', pointed out in p. 198</ref>

==Etymology==
Chubb is associated with the word 'chubby', round and fat in bodily shape, like Hobbits usually are.

Chubb is a real-life English surname.<ref name="Nomen">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]" in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 755</ref>
