The haven of '''Rómenna''' was the main seaport of [[Númenor]] situated on its east coast, through which much of the traffic with the old lands of [[Middle-earth]] passed. Many of the [[Faithful]] were forced to relocate to Rómenna late in Númenor's history.

==Overview==
Rómenna was located in the region of [[Arandor]] about 50 miles east of the capital city of [[Armenelos]]. The port stood on the south side of the [[Firth of Rómenna]] which opened onto the [[Bay of Rómenna]] and then onto the Sea.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> The main road of [[Númenor]] ran from Rómenna through Armenelos past [[Meneltarma]] and on to [[Andúnië]] on the west coast.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

==History==
Rómenna was the greatest port in [[Númenor]]. There were large shipyards in Rómenna and the most highly skilled shipwrights worked there. The mariner [[Vëantur]] had a house with its own quay in Rómenna and [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] frequently came there and kept his ships in the harbour.

[[Tar-Meneldur]] closed the shipyards in Rómenna during a dispute with his son [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] in {{SA|829}}. The shipyards were reopened in {{SA|843|n}} and Aldarion repaired and expanded the harbour works and built sea-walls. Aldarion's wife [[Erendis]] died in the water at Rómenna in {{SA|985|n}}.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

During the reign of [[Ar-Gimilzôr]] ({{SA|3102|n}}-{{SA|3175|n}}), many of the [[Faithful]] of Númenor were forced to relocate from [[Andúnië]] to Rómenna so the [[King's Men]] could keep watch on them. More were drawn there by Amandil, the leader of the Faithful during the reign of [[Ar-Pharazôn]].<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> When Númenor was destroyed in {{SA|3319|n}},<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> the Faithful led by [[Elendil]] boarded ships at Rómenna and escaped to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="Akallabeth"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Rómenna'' means "eastwards" in Quenya from ''[[rómen]]'' meaning "east" and the suffix ''[[-nna]]'' indicating movement towards.
