'''Saelon''' was one of the main characters in ''[[The New Shadow]]'', the abandoned sequel to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

== History ==
Saelon was caught by [[Borlas]] as a child when he was stealing an apple in Borlas' garden. Borlas' anger and description of Saelon's behaviour as doing ''orc's work'' struck in to Saelon's heart - he felt deeply aggrieved and held this as a deep grudge.

Some years later, Borlas and Saelon sat in the garden across from [[Minas Tirith]]. After Borlas described the [[Dark Tree]], it is Saelon who later mentions that there were men who have grown ''under the shadow'' in recent times and whispered the name [[Herumor (The New Shadow)|Herumor]], the possible leader of a rebellious faction in Gondor, to Borlas.<ref>{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>
