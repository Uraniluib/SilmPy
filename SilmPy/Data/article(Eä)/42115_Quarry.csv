'''Quarry''' was a location in the northern [[Eastfarthing]], to the south of the [[hills of Scary]] and between [[Scary]] and [[Brandywine]],<ref>{{FR|Part}}.</ref>

Quarry could have been simply a stone-quarry<ref>{{HM|N}}, s.v. <i>Scary</i>, p. 775</ref> but possibly it could also have been a small [[Hobbit]] settlement or a village<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Quarry"</ref> as well.
==Etymology==
The word [[Wiktionary:quarry#Etymology 1|quarry]] is derived from Latin ''quarreria'' through French.

[[David Salo]] noted that the usage of a Latin-French word as a place-name is peculiar, in contrast to all other placenames which have [[Old English]] and/or [[Celtic]] etymologies; he suggests that the name perhaps represents a late [[Westron]] word, and not an original [[Hobbitish]] place-name.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
