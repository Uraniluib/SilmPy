'''Regent''' ([[Quenya|Q]]. ''[[Karma]]-[[kundo]]'', "Guardian of the Helm") was a title applied to those granted executive authority in place of a legitimate reigning king.

==[[Númenor]]ean precedent==
Before the time of [[Tar-Aldarion]], no [[Kings of Númenor|King]] had ever left the [[Elenna|island]] during his reign. When Tar-Aldarion resolved to travel to [[Middle-earth]], the [[Council of the Sceptre]] sought a regency to rule in his place. The king's father, [[Meneldur]], refused the regency when offered, and Meneldur's cousin, [[Hallatan]] of [[Hyarastorni]], became regent instead.  [[Ancalimë]] served as regent on more than one occasion while her father voyaged.<ref>[[Christopher Tolkien]]'s discussion of his father's notes for the unfinished portions of ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]''</ref>
==[[Gondor]]==
In all the history of the [[Kings of Gondor]], only one Regent of this kind was ever appointed, [[Minalcar]].

Minalcar was the grandson of [[Atanatar II|Atanatar II Alcarin]] and son of [[Calmacil (King of Gondor)|Calmacil]]. In the closing years of his grandfather's rule, he had become a forceful presence in the royal councils as neither of the King's sons, [[Narmacil I|Narmacil]] nor Calmacil, showed great interest in state affairs. Just a few short years after his uncle Narmacil succeeded the King, he conferred the office of Karma-kundo on Minalcar; from that point he effectively ruled [[Gondor]] for no less than sixty-four years, though officially doing so in the King's name.<ref>{{PM|Ai}}</ref> Minalcar would eventually ascend to the throne of Gondor himself under his better-known name [[Rómendacil II]].

After the death of [[Ondoher]] and his sons, [[Steward]] [[Pelendur]] ruled Gondor briefly between {{TA|1944}} and {{TA|1945|n}} until [[Earnil I]] was appointed as Ondoher's successor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> The [[Ruling Stewards]] were effectively "Regents" who ruled Gondor indefinitely in the King's absence.

==Etymology==
''Karma-kundo'' is translated "Helm-guardian".<ref>{{PM|Ai}}, p. 260</ref> 

In the orthography used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', this name would be written ''Carma-cundo'', since Tolkien usually represented the [k]-sound with the letter "c".
