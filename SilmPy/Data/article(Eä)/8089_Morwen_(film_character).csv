'''Morwen''' is a character invented specifically for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. She is played by [[Robyn Malcolm]]. 

==History==
Morwen was the mother of [[Freda]] and [[Éothain (film character)|Éothain]],  whom she sent to alert [[Théoden]] that the [[Dunlendings|Wild Men]] were pillaging through [[Rohan]]. Her children were kept at [[Edoras]] until Théoden led his people to shelter at [[Helm's Deep]], where the children were reunited with their mother.
==Etymology==
The name [[Morwen]] is unusual for the [[Rohirrim]], being [[Sindarin]] and not [[Old English]]. Movie producers reasoned that this Elvish name would become popular in Rohan after the coming of [[Morwen Steelsheen]], the [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] queen consort of [[Thengel]].
