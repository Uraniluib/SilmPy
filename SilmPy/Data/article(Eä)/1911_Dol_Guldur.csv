{{Pronounce|Dol Guldur.mp3|Ardamir}}

'''Dol Guldur''' ("Hill of Sorcery" in [[Sindarin]]),<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> also called "the dungeons of the Necromancer",<ref>{{H|1}}</ref><ref>''"The sins of Middle Earth, Tolkien's use of Allegory"''. Chapter 6. Greenwood Press. pp. 86.</ref> was a stronghold of [[Sauron]] located in the south of [[Mirkwood]].

==History==
Dol Guldur was originally known as '''[[Amon Lanc]]''' ("Bald Hill") in [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 12, p. 280</ref> It had been the capital of [[Oropher]]'s [[Silvan Elves]], who had departed north to the Dark Mountains<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 14, p. 280</ref> (later known as the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]]).

Somewhere after {{TA|1000}}, an evil presence took over Amon Lanc. It was in {{TA|1050|n}} that a [[shadow]] fell upon Greenwood and it began to be called [[Mirkwood]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> The hostile entity was known as "the [[Necromancer]]" by the peoples. [[Thranduil]] son of [[Oropher]] led his people over the [[Forest River]], where they remained.<ref>{{UT|6b}}, p. 259</ref>
[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'']]
The [[White Council|Council of the Wise]] long feared the Necromancer might be none other than [[Sauron]] himself who secretly regained his powers after his defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. In {{TA|2063|n}} [[Gandalf]] went to Dol Guldur, and the "Necromancer", not yet powerful, fled to the [[East]] so as not to be identified.

After [[Watchful Peace|four centuries]] in {{TA|2460|n}}, just as [[the One Ring]] was found by [[Sméagol]] the [[Stoors|Stoor]], the "Necromancer" returned there.<ref name="TA"/>

A dark [[shadow]] and cloud flowed from Dol Guldur whereas a golden mist that came from [[Lothlórien]] to the west contended with the darkness coming from Mirkwood. In {{TA|2510}} when [[Eorl]] the Young was leading his riders to the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]] he steered his force westward to avoid the phenomenon of the shadow, and they entered the mist.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, p. 298</ref>

In {{TA|2845|n}} [[Thráin|Thráin II]], [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]-in-exile and holder of the [[Ring of Thrór|last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] of the [[Dwarves]], was on his way to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. He was captured near the eaves of Mirkwood, imprisoned and tortured in Dol Guldur's dungeons, and his Ring taken from him. In {{TA|2850|n}} Gandalf again entered Dol Guldur, found the dying Thráin, and was entrusted with the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to give to [[Thorin]], although Thráin could not tell him his own or his son's name before he died. Gandalf confirmed that the Necromancer, the master of Dol Guldur at that time, was Sauron.<ref name="TA"/>

Gandalf returned to the [[White Council]] and urged an attack on Dol Guldur, but was overruled by [[Saruman]], who secretly had begun searching for the One Ring in the area by then. In {{TA|2941}} Saruman finally agreed to an attack, which occurred at the same time as the [[Quest of Erebor]]. This was carefully planned by Gandalf, so that Sauron and [[Smaug]] could not assist each other, as otherwise they could easily have done. During the attack, Sauron fled to [[Mordor]], his plans now ready.

In {{TA|2951|n}} Dol Guldur was reoccupied by [[Khamûl]], the second chief<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, note 1, p. 352</ref>, and two other [[Nazgûl]].<ref name="TA"/>

In the following decades Dol Guldur must have rebuilt some of its power until the [[War of the Ring]], during which its forces made assaults upon the [[Woodland Realm]] and [[Lothlórien|Lórien]],<ref name=great/> causing grievous damage to the outlying woodlands. However each time they were driven back by [[Thranduil]] and [[Galadriel]] who held the power of [[Nenya]]; which only Sauron himself could have overcome.

Dol Guldur was finally destroyed and cleansed by the [[Elves]] of Lórien, led by [[Galadriel]], after Sauron's fall.<ref name=great>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Dol Guldur'' is [[Sindarin]] from ''dol'' "hill" and ''[[guldur]]'' "sorcery".{{fact}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The original name of Dol Guldur was Dol Dúgol, and on [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s first map for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the hill was located much farther east than its later location (in square M-15 of Map II).<ref name="Map II">{{TI|MII}}, p. 305</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained that Map II had faint traces of green which suggested that Mirkwood originally extended farther to the east too.<ref>{{TI|First}}, p. 298</ref> The name Dol Dúgol was stricken out and the hill was moved to its later location on this map, but its name became Dol Dúghul before finally changing to Dol Guldur.<ref name="Map II"/>

===Films===
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Dol Guldur is depicted as a ruined and abandoned fortress of unknown origin. It features statues of the Nazgûl. [[Radagast]], not [[Gandalf]], enters Dol Guldur. He is attacked by the [[Witch-king]], obtains a [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]], and finds that Dol Guldur is occupied by a [[Sauron|Necromancer]]. He then travels to Gandalf to tell him the news and gives him the sword as proof.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Gandalf enters Dol Guldur to investigate its ruins. There he meets [[Azog]] and his army. He tries to escape, but is trapped by [[Sauron|the Necromancer]], who reveals to Gandalf his true identity. Gandalf is later seen trapped in one of the cages.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:[[Galadriel]] enters Dol Guldur in order to rescue Gandalf. Accompanied by [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]] they encounter Sauron and [[Nazgûl|the Nine]]. The [[Attack on Dol Guldur|Attack]] begins and Sauron flees to [[Mordor|the East]].

===Games===
'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Dol Guldur makes appearance during both "Good" and "Evil" campaigns as a site of a major battleground.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Dol Guldur is commanded by the [[Mouth of Sauron]], not [[Khamûl]]. Dol Guldur (or Mordor itself) sent a huge army of Orcs, Haradrim, and Trolls to assault [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. The attack fails, and the Mouth of Sauron is killed along with all the attacking force. Dol Guldur is then itself attacked by a combined army of Elves and Dwarves led by [[Elrond]], [[Arwen]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Glóin]], and [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. After a long and hard struggle, the Elves and Dwarves finally overrun Dol Guldur and lay waste to the evil that dwelled there, ending Sauron's war campaign in the North once and for all.

:In the Evil Campaign, the Goblins from Dol Guldur eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the Forest Road in Mirkwood.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dol Guldur is a central point in the game's second expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood]]''. In its storyline, Celeborn and Galadriel organize a military campaign against Dol Guldur while the Fellowship still resides in Lothlórien (not to be confused with the later battle during the War of the Ring). The announced goal is to sow chaos into Orc forces by destroying as many of their troops, weapons and supplies as possible, to delay an inevitable assault upon Lothlórien. The true purpose, however, is to distract the Eye of Sauron from the company departing down the shores of Anduin. An assault by the Golden Host of the Galadhrim is successful despite minor losses and after establishing multiple camps throughout southern Mirkwood arrives at the walls of the fortress itself. However, without the White Lady they do not have the means of bringing down the walls, so the Elves prepare to swiftly fall back beyond Anduin before the main forces of the Enemy arrive. The players can also explore multiple locations within the Fortress, among them the Necromancer's Gate, the Ringwraith's Lair, the Dungeons of Dol Guldur, the chief tower named Barad Guldur and Sammath Gul - the chambers once occupied by the Dark Lord himself. Much later, after the [[War of the Ring]], the Galadhrim and [[Elves of Mirkwood]] lead a great assault on Dol Guldur, where Galadriel casts down the walls of the stronghold, and renames the hill ''Dol Dhannen'', "The Hill of Ruin".
