'''Durin V''' (early [[Third Age]]) was a King of [[Durin's folk]] who ruled the great city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] during the height of its glory, and the fifth Durin. Like his father he bore a [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]].

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first of the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.

==Etymology==
''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Durin V's story is expanded on in a series of quests. During his reign, the dragon Thorog took Helegrod, a northern city of his kingdom located near the source of the [[Bruinen]]. Durin took up the axe Mírdanant, a gift from the [[elves]] of [[Eregion]] to his ancenstors, and led a small company of dwarves to reclaim the city. Durin and Thorog killed each other, and only one dwarf of his company survived to tell the story.

:Helegrod was left abandoned by the dwarves. Mírdanant was said to be blessed by the elves with words of protection, and so the death of the king while bearing the axe and its loss in the abandoned city was a source of tension between Durin's Folk and the elves. A quest in the game involves reclaiming Mírdanant from the reanimated carcass of Thorog and returning it to the elves of [[Rivendell]], who in turn return it to [[Glóin]].
