'''Elephants''' were creatures only mentioned fleetingly. [[Gandalf]] does mention them,<ref>{{H|2}}</ref> so it is possible that they shared the wide burning plains of the [[Harad]] with what would be their giant relatives, the [[Oliphaunts|Mûmakil]].

In [[Quenya]], the word for "elephant" is ''andamunda''. The [[Noldorin]] cognate of the same meaning is ''andabon'' or ''annabon''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 372 (root [[MBUD|MBUD-]])</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: ''Andamundar'' (suggested plural form of ''Andamunda'') are described as "the smaller and more numerous cousin of the famous Mûmak".<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref>
