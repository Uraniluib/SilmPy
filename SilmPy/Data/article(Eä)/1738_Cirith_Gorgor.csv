'''Cirith Gorgor''' was the point where the mountain ranges of the [[Ered Lithui]] and the [[Ephel Dúath]] met, to the north-west of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] and [[Mordor]]. It was sealed by the Morannon ([[Black Gate]]) and guarded by the two [[Towers of the Teeth]], [[Carchost]] and [[Narchost]].<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref>

It was also called the ''Haunted Pass of Cirith Gorgor'', because of the evil that lurked there.
==Etymology==
Cirith Gorgor is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[cirith]]'' "pass" and ''[[gorgor]]'' "extreme horror".
