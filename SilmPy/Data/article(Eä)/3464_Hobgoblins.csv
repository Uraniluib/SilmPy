'''Hobgoblin''' was a name "''for the larger kinds''"<ref>{{H|Preface}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 24</ref> of [[Orcs]] found in [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Third Age]]. In the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], [[Gandalf]] warns [[Bilbo Baggins]] that the [[Grey Mountains]] are "''simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description''".<ref>{{H|7}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==

The term appears only twice in the published writings on the legendarium (both in ''[[The Hobbit]]''). It has been speculated that "''the term perhaps, but doubtfully, refers to the large soldier-orcs known as [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]]''"<ref>"[http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/h/hobgoblins.html Hobgoblins]", at [http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/default.asp Encyclopedia of Arda], as of 5 September 2010</ref>, possibly since Tolkien had not created the latter name by the time of his writing of ''The Hobbit''.

In a 1971 letter to [[Roger Lancelyn Green]], Tolkien commented that "''the statement that hobgoblins were 'a larger kind' is the reverse of the original truth.''"<ref>{{L|319}}</ref>
