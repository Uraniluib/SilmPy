'''Thuringwethil''' (perished {{FA|465}}) was a [[Vampire]] servant of [[Sauron]] during the First Age. She was Sauron's messenger, but was caught in the battle between her master, [[Lúthien]] and [[Huan]] at [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] ("Isle of Werewolves"). She was slain either by the [[Hound of Valinor]] or in the collapse of [[Minas Tirith in Beleriand|Minas Tirith]]. Lúthien later used her cloak to sneak into [[Angband]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]].<ref>{{S|19}}</ref>

Because of Thuringwethil's ability to change forms, she may have been a [[Maiar|Maia]] or some sort of [[skin-changer]].

== Etymology ==
The name is glossed as "Woman of Secret Shadow"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> or "she of hidden shadow".<ref>{{LB|C13}}, Note to line 3954, p. 304</ref>

The above can be analyzed as ''[[thurin]]'' "secret, hidden", ''[[gwath]]'' "shadow" and an obscure ending ''[[-il]]'' which perhaps denotes feminine gender (and which causes "[[i-affection|umlauting]]" (or "[[wikipedia:Affection (linguistics)|affection]]") of ''gwath'' to ''gweth'').
