'''''asëa''''' is a [[Quenya]] word which also constitutes the first element of the plant name ''[[asëa aranion]]''.<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref><ref name=PE49>{{PE|17}}, p. 49</ref> A signification given of ''asëa'' is "name of plant '[[athelas]]'".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 148</ref>
==Etymology==
The meaning and etymology of ''asëa'' is a matter of debate. In [[1998]], William Cloud Hicklin claimed to have "ongoing discussion about the origins of [the word [[athelas]]]" with [[Christopher Tolkien]], and wrote in a forum message that:

"''a very late note [by Tolkien] (1970 or later) says that Asea [...] was the name in Quenya, regularly adapted and compounded with -las in Sindarin.  The plant was known to the medical loremasters of the Noldor. The root is *ATHAYA, 'helpful, kindly, beneficial.''"<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books.tolkien/msg/3fad9c3c879f5a2c Athelas] (message from William Cloud Hicklin, dated 26 October 1998) at [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books.tolkien Rec.arts.books.tolkien] (accessed 13 May 2011)</ref>

Hicklin's assertion has attracted a widespread attention on the Internet,<ref>[http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?p=2854688 Annotated LotR Project: Flight to the Ford] at [http://forums.theonering.com Forums.theonering.com] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref><ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/32497 Message 32497] (dated 4 October 2005) at [[Elfling]] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.tuckborough.net/plants.html Plants & Trees] (cf.

The second meaning is given as "2) asëa (þ) noun, name of the healing plant called in Sindarin ''athelas''", referring to {{PE|17}}, p. 148.</ref>

Another mention of the existence of an unpublished etymology of ''athelas''/''asëa'' occurred in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' ([[2005]]/[[2008]]), where the authors referred to a claim by [[Arden R. Smith]]. Here it was written that the first element in ''athelas'' is connected with Quenya ''asëa''.<ref name=RC183>{{HM|RC}}, p. 183</ref> 

With the publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s manuscript "Words, Phrases & Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings''" in [[2007]], an etymology of ''athelas''/''asëa'' was published, and editor [[Christopher Gilson]] wrote in a comment that this etymology is the source of the claim in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]''. 

Since Tolkien's manuscript date from the late 1950s and early 1960s (and does not include any mention of the root ATHAYA), Hicklin's claim of an unpublished etymology dating from the 1970s remains unverified in published sources.

In his analysis of the Quenya words in "Words, Phrases & Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings''", Petri Tikka has tentatively suggested that ''asëa'' could mean "foil" (gloss followed by a question mark).<ref>Petri Tikka, "[http://www.petritikka.com/elvish/PE17.html Quenya words in Parma Eldalambaron 17]" at [http://www.petritikka.com/elvish/ Men Eldalambínen: A Place in Elvish] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref><ref group="note">Tikka's reasoning apparently stems from a literal translation of ''[[asëa aranion]]'' as "[[athelas|kingsfoil]]". Tolkien's translation of ''asëa aranion'' as "asëa of the Kings" is given in {{PE|17}}, p. 100, and the note which says "''athelas'' 'kingsfoil' appears on p. 49.</ref>
