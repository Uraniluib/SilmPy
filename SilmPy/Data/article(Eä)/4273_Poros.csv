The '''Poros''' was a river in south of [[Gondor]].  It formed the northern border of the contested land of Harondor ([[South Gondor]]), and the southern border of [[Ithilien]]. During the later [[Third Age]] it was the effective southern border of Gondor.

About 400 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles long, it began in the [[Ephel Dúath]] of [[Mordor]] and then flowed south-west for about 300 miles, when it bent to the north-west and met the [[Anduin]] just before the Anduin began its delta.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

The Poros was crossed by the [[Harad Road]] at the ''[[Haudh in Gwanûr]]''.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

In {{TA|2885}}, the [[Haradrim]] crossed the Poros and invaded [[Ithilien]] with great strength. Reinforced by [[Rohan]], Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the crossings of Poros, though the Rohirrim princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The meaning of the name ''Poros'' is unknown.<ref>[http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2011/10/poros-and-borphorus.html The Poros and the Bosphorus] at [http://lingwe.blogspot.com/ Lingwë.blogspot.com] (accessed 12 October 2011)</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations ==
[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] speculated in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' that the [[Sea of Helcar]] drained into the [[Great Gulf]] and that Poros is what remained of the narrow region called the [[Straits of the World]] that once separated the Sea from the Gulf.<ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> Fonstand's interpretation was predicated on the idea that [[Mordor]] was created in the Second Age where the Sea of Helcar once lay.<ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> However, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (which was published after Fontstad's ''Atlas''), [[Melkor]] was said to have created [[Mount Doom]] in Mordor during the "long [[First Age]]".<ref>{{PM|Last}} p. 390 (note 14)</ref> Additionally, it is told in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that the migration of the [[Drúedain]] from [[Hildórien]] brought them westward through lands south of Mordor, and that they became the first Men to cross the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, pp. 339-340</ref>
