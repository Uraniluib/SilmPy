'''Summerfilth''' was a non-existent month used jocularly among [[Shire-hobbits]].

Proverbially, Summerfilth would begin on the day of [[Highday|Friday]]; there was no actual month in the [[Shire Calendar]] that ever started on a Friday (since after the reform of c. {{TA|2670}}, each weekday always fell on the same date) and the Hobbits would say "''on Friday the first of Summerfilth''" to refer to something that would never happen.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref> 
==Etymology==
The name 'Summerfilth' is taken from the real month of [[Winterfilth]] (approximately equivalent to our October).
