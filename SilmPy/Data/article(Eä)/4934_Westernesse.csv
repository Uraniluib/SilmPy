'''Westernesse''' was a name in the [[Westron|Common Speech]] for the [[Númenor|Isle of Númenor]].
==Etymology==
The ending ''-ess'' (also in [[Elvenesse]]) was used in romance literature for fictional lands that had partly francized names (as in [[wikipedia:Lyonesse|Lyonesse]] in [[wikipedia:Matter of Britain|Arthurian legends]]).<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 778-9</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the name is Middle English, rare and of vague meaning, taken to mean "Western lands" (in contrast to the [[East]]).<ref>{{L|276}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
In the 13 century chivalric romance ''[[Wikipedia:King_Horn|King Horn]]'', [[Wikipedia:Westernesse|Westernesse]] is a kingdom ruled by "King Ailmar" and it is reached by ship by Horn.<ref name="Nomen"/>
