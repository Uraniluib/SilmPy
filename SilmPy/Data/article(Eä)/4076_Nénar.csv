'''Nénar''' was a star placed in the skies by [[Varda|Varda Elentári]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> Its identity is uncertain - there are some indications that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] considered it to be the [[Elvish]] name of the planet Neptune, but such a faint object seems out of place among the bright stars named with Nénar in [[The Silmarillion]].<ref>{{MR|Star}}, pp. 435-436</ref>
