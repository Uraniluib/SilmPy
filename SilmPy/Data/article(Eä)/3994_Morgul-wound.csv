'''Morgul-wounds''' were inflicted by the weapons of [[Sauron]]'s greatest servants — or, at least, by those of the [[Nazgûl]].  They carried dark enchantments that cursed the wounds suffered by their victims. The wounds themselves varied; those suffered by Steward [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]] in {{TA|2475}} left him in crippling pain and shortened his life<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> (he died in {{TA|2489|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>),  while the wound taken by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]]<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> on [[6 October]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> threatened to make him a wraith.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

On [[13 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}, when [[Faramir]] was retreating to [[Minas Tirith]]<ref name="Great"/> he held at bay a mounted soldier of [[Harad]] as the Nazgûl swirled overhead.  Faramir was struck down by a flying dart - it was feared that it was from the Nazgûl and had created a Morgul-wound.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>  However, after the great battle [[Aragorn]] examined the wound and found it to be healing.  This proved that Faramir had not suffered a Morgul-wound.  It had been believed that it was such though due to Faramir's sickness and fever, but Aragorn diagnosed Faramir's condition as due to weariness, grief, wounding, and the [[Black Breath]].<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref>
