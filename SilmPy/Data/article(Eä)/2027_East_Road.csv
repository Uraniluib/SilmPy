The '''East Road''', '''Great Road''' or '''East-West Road''',<ref name=map>{{UT|Map}}</ref> was the long road that ran east to west through [[Eriador]], and crossed the [[Greenway]] at [[Bree]].
==History==
The East Road was originally laid by the [[Dwarves]] probably during the [[First Age]]{{fact}}, and ran from the [[Iron Hills]] through  [[Rhovanion]] to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], from which it continued across [[Eriador]] to the [[Blue Mountains]], and then on into Kingdom of [[Doriath]] in [[Beleriand]]. 
 
The western parts were built to facilitate the passage of companies of Dwarf craftsmen (and later, their armed escort) across eastern Beleriand, before the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves]] by the dwarves of [[Nogrod]] ended their trade.{{fact}}

After the ruination of [[Nogrod]] and neighbouring [[Belegost]], focus shifted to the eastern part of the ancient road, which had been built by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in the [[Misty Mountains]]. Khazad-dûm's inhabitants, the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] Dwarves, continued to grow in power and influence, and their trading needs meant that the road from the Iron Hills that travelled through [[Mirkwood]] to their gates, known as the [[Old Forest Road|Dwarf-road]], became widely known. On the western side of the Misty Mountains, after traversing the [[High Pass]], the road continued to the Blue Mountains.
 
When the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] realm-in-exile of [[Arnor]] was founded, the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] took over the maintenance of the East Road, and built several fortresses on or near it (including [[Weathertop]]), and expanded or created bridges over the rivers [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] ([[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Stonebows]]) and [[Hoarwell]] ([[Last Bridge]]). After Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}}, the East Road formed the boundary between two of its successor states, [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. During the [[Angmar Wars]], [[Arthedain]] and Cardolan tried to mantain a frontier along the [[Weather Hils]], the East Road, and the lower [[Hoarwell]] against [[Angmar]] and Rhudaur.<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

By the late [[Third Age]] the most notable users of the road were the [[Dwarves]] who traveled to and from the mines of the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref name=eriador/> Those often stopped at [[Bree]], and when they traversed [[the Shire]] they brought scarce news from the outside world; actually being the main link with the wide world for the [[Shire-hobbits]].<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref><ref name=shad>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>
==Course==
The western end of the Road was the [[Grey Havens]], and that portion gave access to the Blue Mountains.<ref name=shad/>

West of the crossroads the [[Hobbits]] had colonized the Shire, and their most important towns lay athwart the East Road; ([[Hobbiton]] and [[Michel Delving]] to name two).

Where the East Road met the [[Greenway]] lay the ancient village of [[Bree]]. A days ride east lay [[The Forsaken Inn]], beyond which lay [[Rivendell]]. 
==Other versions==
Originally, the Road made two great curves: a great loop south of Weathertop to the North-east and then made a great bend southwards, round the feet of the Trollshaws; the text of the First Edition reflects this by saying "the Road bent back again southward towards the River". Because of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s "carelessness" in the [[1954]] [[General Map of Middle-earth|published map]], the Road has only a small northward curve between Weathertop and the Last Bridge, and then runs in a straight line to the Ford of Bruinen. In the Second Edition onwards, in order to agree with the map, the portion of the text was corrected to "the Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen".<ref>{{RS|1XIa}}</ref>

The relevant map in [[Barbara Strachey]]'s atlas ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]'' reflects the earlier descriptions.
