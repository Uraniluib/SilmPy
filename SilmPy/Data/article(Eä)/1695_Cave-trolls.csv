A race of monstrous creatures found in caverns and dark places.The '''Cave-trolls''' are known from an encounter with the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as they passed through [[Moria]], but were evidently found elsewhere in [[Middle-earth]], too. These trolls, along with [[Orcs]] and perhaps other creatures, were originally sent to inhabit Moria by [[Sauron]] some five hundred years before the War of the Ring. 

The cave-trolls of Moria were of huge size with a skin of dark green scales, and flat, toeless feet. The fact that [[Gandalf]] was able to recognise the creature he encountered in Moria specifically as a cave-troll strongly suggests that this appearance was shared by others of the kind.
