'''Arandor''', also known as '''Kingsland''', was the important central region of [[Númenor]], around the island's capital at [[Armenelos]] between the [[Meneltarma]] near the centre of the island and the port of [[Rómenna]] on its eastern coast. It was almost landlocked, but it met the Sea in the far east, where the great port of [[Rómenna]] lay.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> From there, a road ran westward to [[Armenelos]] and then on to the [[Meneltarma]] on the western borders of Arandor.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

In the [[Third Age]], '''Arandor''' was also one of the alternate names for [[Arnor]].
