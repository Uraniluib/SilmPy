It began in the [[Grey Mountains]] far to the north and then flowed south-east, joined by the [[Enchanted River]] near [[Thranduil]]'s caverns, until it met the [[River Running]] at [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] in the [[Long Marshes]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref>

The river was used by the [[Raft-elves]] to carry their goods.<ref>{{H|9}}</ref> This river was used by the Dwarves to escape through the barrels.

:The Forest River was used by the Dwarves to escape from the [[Elvenking's Halls]] in barrels. The Elves, led by [[Legolas]], gave chase, but [[Bolg]] and his orcs attacked them. As the Dwarves were not boxed in the barrels and merely used them to stay afloat, they could fight back against the orcs with whatever weapons they could find. [[Kíli]] was injured by a Morgul arrow when he tried to open a sluice gate in the river.
