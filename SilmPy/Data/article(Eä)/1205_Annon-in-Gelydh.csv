[[File:Jonathan Guzi - Gate of the Noldor.jpg|thumb|250px|right|"Gate of the Noldor" by Jonathan Guzi]]'''Annon-in-Gelydh''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. "Gate of the Noldor]]") was the eastern entrance in the western hills of [[Dor-lomin]], that led to a subterranean river-bed and ended to the [[Cirith Ninniach]].

It was built by the [[Noldor]] of [[Turgon]] in the [[First Age]]. After Turgon's departure to [[Gondolin]], the Gate was forgotten, but it was rediscovered and used centuries later by [[Tuor]] in his escape from the oppressed lands of [[Hithlum]] and find his way into [[Nevrast]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
