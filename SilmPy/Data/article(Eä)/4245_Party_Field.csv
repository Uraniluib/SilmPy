The '''Party Field''' was a large field south of [[Bilbo Baggins]]' front door adjacent to [[Bagshot Row]] near  [[Hobbiton]]. For [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's 111th birthday party]] it was covered with tents and pavilions; underneath the largest pavilion was [[the Party Tree]] where Bilbo made his farewell speech.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>
