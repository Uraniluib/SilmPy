'''East Lórien''' was the name and the Eastern border of [[Lothlórien]] in the area of [[Eryn Lasgalen]] (former [[Mirkwood]]) south of the [[Narrows of the Forest|Narrows]]. The area to the north was populated by [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]].

It was founded after the cleansing of [[Dol Guldur]] during the [[War of the Ring]], and [[Celeborn]] ruled the [[Galadhrim]] of Lothlórien. In the [[Fourth Age]] he grew weary and left for [[Rivendell]] leaving the wooded land of East Lórien populated by only a few wandering [[Silvan Elves]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
