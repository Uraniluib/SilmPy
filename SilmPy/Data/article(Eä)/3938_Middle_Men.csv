'''Middle Men''' was a term used by the [[Númenóreans]] for [[Men]] who were related to the [[Edain]], the ancestors of the Númenóreans themselves.

The proper term is ''Men of Twilight'' (as opposed to the [[Gondorians]], ''[[Númenóreans|High Men]]'', and the [[Haradrim]] and [[Easterlings]], ''[[Men of Darkness]]''). The name reflects the Gondorian attitude towards them: not enemies, but also not as "noble" to be counted among themselves.

Most Middle Men had kinship with the Houses of [[Bëor]] or [[Marach]]. There were also Men in Middle-earth related to the Second House (the [[Haladin]]), and the men of [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]], later to be known as the [[Dunlendings]]. But because they spoke a language that was unknown to the Númenóreans they were not at first recognized as Middle Men.

The term referred sometimes to all the allies of the [[Dúnedain]], such as the [[Northmen]] and especially the [[Rohirrim]], however usually it referred specifically to the Men of [[Eriador]].
==History==
===Origins===
The [[Edain]] come from the people of [[Men]] who fled [[Hildorien]] and were at war with the [[Men of Darkness]] and flet to the [[West]]. Somewhere in northern [[Rhûn]], they had met the [[Dwarves]].<ref>{{WJ|13}}</ref>

There they were divided in two folks, who would later become [[House of Bëor]] and [[House of Hador|House of Marach]], to the north-east of the [[Sea of Rhûn]] where they dwelt in the woods. The ancestors of the Hadorians dwelt in the north-east of the Sea, in the woods that there came near to the shores. The ancestors of the Beorians had reached the feet of the high hills to the south-west. Because of that distance, they both developed a craft of boat-building but met seldom<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref>. 

The ancestors of the Beorians had been mingling with Men of other kinds and their dialect of [[Taliska]] seemed to the rest to contain alien elements.<ref name="DM"/>

The ancestors of the Beorians fled first and the ancestors of the Hadorians learned that only afterwards and followed on their trail through the [[Misty Mountains]] in the North (close to the dreadful [[Iron Mountains]]). Many sub-tribes of both peoples stayed behind, and when the shrinking teams (now led by [[Bëor]] and [[Marach]]) reached [[Beleriand]], those who stayed behind occupied many parts of [[Eriador]] and northern  [[Rhovanion]]<ref name="DM"/>. The latter appear to be akin to the House of Hador.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|8}}</ref>

===Second Age===
In the early [[Second Age]] the Middle Men were far from the coasts of the [[Westlands]]; some settled, some still wandering, or else had never passed the Misty Mountains and were scattered in eastern Rhovanion.<ref name="DM"/>

The Men of Eriador were mostly related to the [[House of Bëor|Folk of Bëor]] and to a lesser degree to the [[Folk of Hador]]; some of them might be descendants of the Edain who fled the [[War of Wrath]]. They occupied mostly the shores of [[Lake Evendim]] (some Elves led by [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] for a while dwelt there side by side with the Men<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>), the [[Weather Hills]] and the [[North Downs]]. They travelled sometimes west of the [[Baranduin]] but did not dwell there. They held the nearby [[Elves of Lindon]] in awe but were friendly to them. But they were afraid to look upon the [[Sea]], no doubt having heard rumours of the deluge of [[Beleriand]].<ref name=atani/><ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

In the year {{SA|600}} [[Vëantur]] first returned to [[Middle-earth]] reaching [[Lindon]] from [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> The news spread swiftly and filled with wonder that some of their distant kin had come, they petitioned [[Gil-galad]] to meet the mariners. Twelve messengers came and rejoiced to meet the Númenóreans on the [[Tower Hills]].<ref name="Wife"/> They found a people who spoke languages which were distantly related to the Númenórean tongue, [[Adûnaic]]. Númenórean scholars declared that this was because these Men were descendants of the fathers of the [[Edain]], the [[Atanatári]], who had not crossed the [[Ered Luin]] and entered [[Beleriand]] during the [[First Age]].

The Númenóreans set up friendly relations with them, and declared them to be Middle Men, as opposed to the High Men (the Edain) or the Men of the Shadow (those hostile to Númenor or in the service of [[Sauron]]); this classification was modeled after that for the Elves by the Edain, being the [[High Elves]], the [[Middle Elves]], and the [[Dark Elves]]. In the "Middle Men" they recognised the similar stature and looks, kinship of language and friendliness to the [[West]].<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

The Númenóreans began to cultivate their new friends who were into their [[Dark Years]], grown weak and fearful, and taught them agriculture, stonecraft, smithying and their language [[Adûnaic]].<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref> The Middle Men were comforted, populated the western shores. They revered the memory of the tall Sea-kings whom they remembered as gods hoping each time for their return<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Aldarion's successors continued his works and wrecked the banks, the shorelines, great tracks and roads whom they drove into the forests northwards and southwards from the [[Gwathló]]<ref name="GC">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> pushing into [[Minhiriath]] and [[Enedwaith]], establishing themselves inland as far as the river [[Glanduin]], the southern boundary of [[Eregion]].<ref>{{App|Languages}}</ref><ref name="GC"/> The [[Gwathuirim]] of Enedwaith were akin to the [[Folk of Haleth]] but were hostile to the Númenóreans, owing to the deforesting their habitat; as such they weren't considered "Middle Men" by the colonists.<ref name=atani/>

[[Sauron]] recruited [[pre-Númenóreans]] and in the early second millennium he increased pressure on the West, left his stronghold in [[Rhûn]] and relocated in [[Mordor]], drawing closer to the Númenórean sphere of influence. His regular troops attempted to conquest Eriador, hunting and killing Middle Men and the Elves and by {{SA|1700}} had mastered all Eriador, up to the River [[Lhûn]] and besieged [[Rivendell]].<ref name="GC"/> Eriador was already ruined when the Númenórean fleet sent by king [[Tar-Minastir]] caught Mordor's troops in the rear and utterly defeated them, but brought peace in the [[Westlands]] had peace.<ref name="GC"/>

As the shadow spread over Númenor, [[Tar-Ciryatan]] sailed to Middle-earth, bringing numerous treasures back to Númenor. Later more lands were occupied, plundered or forced to pay heavy tribute in return for the lives of their inhabitants. Because of these acts they were looked upon in fear, called the "Death" itself and the Men of Middle-earth trembled at the sight of a mighty Númenórean ship on the waters of [[Belegaer]].

In the time of [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]], the settlers of the shores from the [[Gulf of Lune]] to [[Pelargir]] refused to join the rebellion against the [[Valar]] and were joined by exiled [[Faithful]]s who fled the persecution. The term "Middle Men" arose among them.<ref name=atani/>

The Númenóreans eventually ventured north of [[Pelargir]] and also met Men who had settled in valleys on either side of the [[White Mountains]]. So while the term "Middle Men" applied so far to the Men of Eriador they classified those people also as Middle Men, due to their friendliness to the [[West]], and recognized as descendants of the Men who abjured the [[Shadow]].<ref name=atani/>
===Third Age===
After the founding of the Realms in Exile, [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], many Middle Men became subjects of the [[Dúnedain]], and eventually intermarried with them until they became one people.

The [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]] were counted as Middle Men, as were most people living in [[Eriador]]. During the [[Third Age]] the term Middle Men was still applied to the Men of [[Bree]], and the remaining Northmen, such as the Men of [[Dale]] and [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] the Lake-town, and of course the [[Rohirrim]]. King [[Valacar]] of Gondor became so friendly with the Middle Men of Rhovanion that he married [[Vidumavi]], a princess of the Northmen, and his son [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] was of mixed blood. This led to the disastrous [[Kin-strife]] of Gondor.

However hostility developed between the Middle Men of the Haladin branch and the Númenóreans, which would endure until the end of the [[Third Age]].
