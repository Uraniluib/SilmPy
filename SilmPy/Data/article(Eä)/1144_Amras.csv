}} '''Amras''' and his twin brother [[Amrod]] were the youngest sons of [[Fëanor]]. Through their mother [[Nerdanel]]'s line, they inherited red hair, instead of Fëanor's dark hair.

==History==

He, like his brothers, participated in the [[Flight of the Noldor]]. He was deeply attached to his twin brother, and thus they were called  "''[[Ambarussa]]''" (see below). They were nearly identical, being alike in both face and mood,<ref name=Eldamar>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref> but the elder brother, Amrod, had a darker shade of auburn hair after childhood.<ref name=Sons/>

After Fëanor's death, he dwelt in the wide plains of [[East Beleriand]] and with his brother, was known as a great hunter.<ref name=Eldamar/> Amras and his elder brother had little direct involvement with the [[Siege of Angband]],<ref name=Beleriand>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> but when they were summoned by their kin for the [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], as they were present at each [[kinslaying]], or needed to lend aid or shelter, they supported their brothers. He and his twin died during the attack made by the Sons of Fëanor on the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] in {{FA|538}}.<ref name=Voyage>{{S|Voyage}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Amras' [[father-name]] in [[Quenya]] was '''[[Telufinwë]]''', "Last [of] Finwë", for he was the last of the sons of the [[House of Finwë]] and its short form was ''Telvo''. His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''[[Ambarussa]]''' ("top-russet", referring to his hair). His twin Amrod shared the same mother-name for a time (see ''[[Amrod]]'' for further information). While in [[Aman]], others called him '''[[Minyarussa]]''', which means "First-''russa''".

The name ''Amras'' is the Sindarin version of ''Ambarussa''.<ref>{{VT|41b}}, p. 10</ref>

In later notes found in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien mentions that he wished to change the name to ''[[Amros]]'' because of linguistic issues.

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In the draft of the legend of Amrod,<ref name=Sons>{{PM|XI7}}</ref> after his brother's death in the swan-ship of the [[Teleri]] at [[Losgar]], Amras dared speak against his father, and was the last to do so. It should be noted to avoid confusion that in this draft the twins were switched, and [[Amrod]] ('Umbarto' or 'Ambarto') was the younger and Amras ('Ambarussa') the elder. In ''The Silmarillion'', Amrod is the elder and Amras is the younger.

{{quote|In the morning the host was mustered, but of Fëanor's seven sons only six were to be found.  Then Ambarussa went pale with fear.  'Did you not then rouse Ambarussa my brother (whom you called Ambarto?' he said.  'He would not come ashore to sleep (he said) in discomfort.'  But it is thought (and no doubt Fëanor had guessed this also) that it was in the mind of Ambarto to sail his ship back [?afterwards] and rejoin Nerdanel; for he had been much [?shocked] by the deed of his father.  That ship I destroyed first,' said Fëanor (hiding his own dismay). 'Then rightly you gave the name to the youngest of your children,' said Ambarussa, 'And ''Umbarto'' "the Fated" was its true form. Fell and fey are you become.' And after that no one dared to speak again to Fëanor of this matter.|''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]''}}
In earlier stages of development, Amras' name changed a number of times. In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'' his  name was Díriel, Dinithel and Durithel. <ref>{{LT2 | IV}}, pp. 241, 245, 251</ref>
