'''Tighfield''' was a village or town located somewhere in [[the Shire]].<ref group=note>Tighfield's location is unknown as it is not included in the published map ''[[A Part of the Shire]]''.</ref> It was the home of several families, specifically [[Gamwich Family|Gamwich]] (later [[Gammidge Family|Gammidge]]) and [[Roper Family|Roper families]]. 

[[Wiseman Gamwich]] came to Tighfield about two hundred years before the [[War of the Ring]], and Wiseman's son [[Hob Gammidge]] is recorded as a roper, one of a long line of Tighfield rope-makers.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Table S2 ''Rise of the Family of Gardners of the Hill'', p. 115</ref>

Hob's son [[Hobson Gamgee|Hobson]], and in turn his son [[Andwise Roper|Andwise]], were said to have practised their craft in a [[Wikipedia:ropewalk|rope-walk]] (that is, a rope-maker's yard) for many years.<ref>{{TT|IV1}}</ref>

Hob's grandson was [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]], Sam's father, who left Tighfield for [[Hobbiton]], to start a new life as a gardener.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Tighfield's name is associated with the tradition of rope-making there and contains an old word for "rope" (see English "tie", whose spelling was assimilated to verb "tie"). It was the site of a rope-maker's yard, also called "rope-walk" because the ropes were stretched out in long lines over trestles at intervals.<ref name="Nomen"/>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes the modern place-name elements ''tigh, teigh, tye, tey'' which are unrelated; they mean "an enclosed piece of land" and do not occur as the first element in a compound.<ref name="Nomen"/>

Tolkien also noted that the term "rope-walk" in the text has confused several of his translators, to the point of imagining rope bridges.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 777</ref>
