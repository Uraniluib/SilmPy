 [[Image:Harma.gif|left]]''Aha'' was also the later name in Quenya of the eleventh letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet<ref name="Names"/> and the third letter of the third grade or [[Tyellë]], which contains "voiceless spirants".  It was the third letter in the third series of consonants.

For written Quenya, the third series is used for the ''k''-series, the ''[[Calmatéma]]''.<ref name="Letters">{{App|Letters}}</ref>  Originally the letter ''Aha'' was called ''[[Harma]]'' and it represented spirant '''CH''' in all positions.  While the letter retains this value in medial positions, over time the sound softened into breath '''H''' at the beginning of words and the name of the letter when so used is ''Aha''.<ref name="Names"/>
