'''Arveleg I''' ({{TA|1309}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1409}}<ref>{{App|North}}</ref>) was the eighth king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Argeleb I]].

==History==
During his lifetime, the father of Arveleg, Argeleb son of [[Malvegil]], was the only King in Arnor that still had [[Isildur]]'s heritage. As such, he claimed lordship over [[Rhudaur]] and [[Cardolan]]. The men of Rhudaur resisted this claim, and a captain of the [[Hill-men]] of that land formed a secret alliance with Argeleb's enemy, the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. Thus Arveleg grew up in an era of War. The armies of [[Angmar]] and Rhudaur laid siege to the [[Weather Hills]], and Argeleb fell. And so, in {{TA|1356}}, Arveleg became the eighth King of Arthedain.

With the help of the Dúnedain of Cardolan and the [[Elves of Lindon]], Arveleg managed to drive out the enemies from the Weather Hills. Arthedain and Cardolan kept a guarded border along the Weather Hills, the [[East Road]] and the lower [[Hoarwell]]. This defense was apparently effective, as Angmar shifted its attention to [[Rivendell]] instead. 

In {{TA|1409}}, the armies of Angmar and Rhudaur crossed the Hoarwell, occupied Cardolan, and closed in on Weathertop. In a bloody [[Fall of Amon Sûl|battle]], both Arveleg and the last prince of Cardolan were slain. The [[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]] of Amon Sûl could be saved, however, and was brought to the capital of Arthedain, [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]].

After his death, Arveleg was succeeded by his 18-year old son, [[Araphor]]. Though this was a young age for one of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood, he was valiant. With the help of the [[Círdan]] of Lindon, he repelled attacks on Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Arveleg's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Mighty King" from ''[[aran]]'' meaning "royal", and ''[[beleg]]'' (becoming [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''veleg'') meaning "mighty, strong".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''ara(a)-'' and ''beleg''</ref>  It is unusual that ''beleg'' should become ''veleg'' in mutation, as ''(m)beleg'' is in the Sindarin ''mb'' class of words and would normally stay ''beleg'' after ''r''. This could be marked up dialect of the time.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:The events surrounding Arveleg play a major role in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. Arveleg, voiced by [[Cam Clarke]], is portrayed as using the [[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír of Amon Sûl]] to anticipate the Witch-king's plans. He survives the Fall of Amon Sûl and takes the palantír with him, but destroys it (and himself in the process) to prevent it from falling in the Witch-king's hands.
