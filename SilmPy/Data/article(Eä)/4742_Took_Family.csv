The '''Took''' family was the pre-eminent clan of [[Hobbits]] in [[the Shire]], being wealthy and having held the office of the [[Thain]] for centuries.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>  ("Took" was pronounced like "Two-k", not like "book" or "took" as in the past tense of "take"{{fact}}).

==Territory, origins and customs==
Tooks were mainly of [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] Hobbit stock, and had quite a reputation for unusual behavior (among other things being more adventurous than the other Hobbits<ref name=”hobbits”>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>), a quality not valued in the Shire. For this reason they were seen as less respectable. An absurd legend among other families, was that one of the Took ancestors married a [[fairies|fairy]]. The [[Istari|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] was a known, if disreputable, associate.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] both had Took mothers.
 
The majority of the Tooks lived in the [[Great Smials]] of [[Tuckborough]] and in the surrounding area of [[Tookland]], which lay in the [[Westfarthing]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  A smaller clan called the '''[[North-took Family|North-tooks]]''' who lived far up in [[Long Cleeve]]; these were descendants of the legendary hero [[Bandobras Took]].<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref>

As was customary in traditional hobbit families, the head of the Took family ruled the clan with his wife, thus upon his death, she continued to rule as the matriarch of the family. Such was the case with [[Lalia Clayhanger]] who succeeded her husband, [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras]], to clan leadership. However, the Thainship passed only through male descent, so her son, [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]], was the Thain immediately after his father’s death.<ref name="letter">{{L|214}}</ref>

Took men usually were given high-sounding names which evoked battles, weapons or figures of legend, like Gerontius, Fortimbras or Isembold. [[Razanur Tûk|Razanur Took]] (Pippin) was named after [[Razanur]], a mythical traveller.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> Took women had names of jewels, or exotic or mythical flowers.<ref name="Trans">{{App|F2}}</ref>

==History==
The first recorded Took was [[Isumbras Took I|Isumbras Took]], who in {{SR|740}} became the 13th [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]] after [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] crossed into [[Buckland]] and became the Master there. <ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Thereafter Isumbras Took was known as Isumbras I and the office of the Thain became hereditary within the Took family.

Excavation of the seat of the Took family, the Great Smials, was begun  in {{SR|1083}} by Thain [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]].<ref name="TA"/>

[[Bandobras Took]], the "Bullroarer", defeated an Orc-band in the Northfarthing in {{SR|1147|n}}.<ref name="TA"/>

In {{SR|1434|n}} his descendant [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin "Pippin" Took]] became the 20th Thain of the Took line, the 32nd in the Shire.   In {{SR|1484|n}} Thain Peregrin I handed his office to his son, [[Faramir Took I]] and rode away from the Shire (later it is said that he and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] were laid to rest beside the bed of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] after his passing).<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

In the [[Fourth Age]] the Great Smials became an important repository of historic books and records.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

==Family Tree Notes==
<references group="note"/>
==Etymology==
'''''Tûk''''' was an older name of unknown meaning in Hobbitish [[Westron]].<ref name="Trans"/>

''Took'' is a [[Welsh]] surname, referring to a type of sword. One of the earliest spellings of the Hobbitish form of the name in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' (''Tūca'') matches the Welsh spelling for this name/sword,<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[Tolkien and Welsh]]'', pp. 126-127</ref> which suggests that Tolkien apparently was aware of the Welsh meaning.

Coincidentally, it is also pronounced similarly to the Swedish word "tok", which means "fool".

==Inspiration==
The inspiration for [[Elvish]] blood amongst the Tooks may have possibly come from the Tollkühn family intermarrying with nobility:
{{quote|The family [Tollkühn] was also supposed to have connections with France and to have ''intermarried with the nobility in that country''', where they acquired a French version of their nickname, du Temeraire.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

{{quote|  [Tolkien's] Aunt Grace preferred the more romantic (if implausible) story of how one of the du Temeraires [Tolkiens] had fled across the [English] Channel in 1794 to escape the guillotine, apparently then assuming a form of the old name, 'Tolkien'. This gentleman was reputedly an accomplished  harpsichordist and clock-repairer.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

The inspiration for the name Took may have come from Tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy".

{{quote|'She [Tolkien's aunt Grace] alleged that the family name ['Tolkien'] had originally been 'von Hohenzollern', for they had emanated from the Hohenzollern district of the Holy Roman Empire. A certain George von Hohenzollern had, she said, fought on the side of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria at the Siege of Vienna in 1529. He had shown great daring in leading an unofficial raid against the Turks and capturing the Sultan's standard. This (said Aunt Grace) was why he was given the nickname '''Tollkühn, 'foolhardy'; and the name stuck.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}
