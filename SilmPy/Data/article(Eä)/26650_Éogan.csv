'''Éogan''' is a character created specifically for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''. He was one of the Men of Angmar, the [[Angmarim]], but became the second-in-command of the [[Blackwolds]], and eventually their chieftain. 

He led an attack [[Archet]] attempting to find the treasure they were looking for from two [[Hobbits]]. He managed to slay the town's captain, [[Jon Brackenbrook|Jon Brackenbrook's]] father, but was wounded himself in the attack. He fled after he learned the two Hobbits staying in Archet weren't the ones he was looking for.<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>
