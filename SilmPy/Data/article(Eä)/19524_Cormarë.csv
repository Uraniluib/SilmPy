''Cormarë'' is a [[Quenya]] word glossed as "Ringday", apparently containing the unattested word ''[[corma]]'' ("ring").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=25 June 2011}}</ref>
