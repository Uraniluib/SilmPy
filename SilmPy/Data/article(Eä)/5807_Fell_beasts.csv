The '''Fell beasts''',<ref name=V6>{{RK|V6}}</ref> also called '''hell-hawks''' <ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> and '''Nazgûl-birds''',<ref>{{L|100}}</ref> were the flying creatures on which the [[Nazgûl]] rode after being unhorsed at the [[Ford of Bruinen]].

==History==

The fell beasts were winged creatures with beak and claws, similar to birds but much larger than any other flying beast. The creature possessed a naked body without feathers, a long neck, and a vast hide between its horned fingers. Furthermore, the body of the creature gave off a stench.<ref name=V6/>

{{Blockquote|[...] it was a winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older world maybe it was [...]|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name=V6 />}}

While the exact origin of the beasts is unknown, they were likely bred by Sauron from a creature of the [[Elder Days]] to supply the Nazgûl with steeds.<ref name=V6/>

On the River [[Anduin]] near [[Sarn Gebir]], [[Legolas]] might have shot one down in the night as it approached the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], although the identity of the creature he shot remains unknown.<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], the Lord of the Nazgûl, rode his fell beast in battle against King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]]. The Lord of the Nazgûl, riding the evil beast, shot a dart which killed [[Snowmane]], Théoden's horse (which fell on Théoden, crushing him). Dernhelm (who revealed herself as [[Éowyn]]) defended the dying Théoden, challenging and killing the beast.<ref name=V6/>

==Inspiration==

Asked about the nature of the "steed of the Witch-king", [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] replied that the fell beast was not intended to be ''[[Wikipedia:pterosaur|pterodactylic]]'', but hesitantly acknowledged that it resembles a ''pterosaur'' and may have been a survivor of older geological eras.<ref>{{L|211}}</ref>

==Etymology==
As in the expression "fell things" occurring earlier in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> the word ''[[Wiktionary:fell#Etymology_4|fell]]'' in this sense is an archaic English word meaning "dreadful, terrible".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 110</ref> 

It may also be noted that the expression "fell beasts" is not used solely for the winged steeds of the Nazgûl: it was also used as a descriptor for various evil creatures of Mirkwood.<ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>

'''1978: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:One of the Nazgûl (possibly the Witch-king, for he carries a mace) is shown riding a fell beast. However, Bakshi's film only covers events up to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], so this is the last seen of the fell beasts and their riders.

'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl ride winged horses. In the confrontation of Éowyn and the Witch-king, the latter rode a plump black-grey dragon-like animal. 

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: The Fell Beasts are said to likely be "distant relatives of ancient [[Cold-drakes]]", and "grow to lengths of 30 feet (with 30-35-foot wingspans)". In the middle Third Age they live in mountainous areas of [[Mirkwood]], presumably because of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]'s presence at [[Dol Guldur]]. They are used as steeds by both the Nazgûl and a few [[Olog-hai]] warlords.<ref>{{ICE|2019}}</ref><ref group="note">In the supplement, ''[[Creatures of Middle-earth (2nd edition)|Creatures of Middle-earth]]'', the Fell beasts are said to be "presumably bred from Winged-drakes" and to have a body between 15-25 feet and a wingspan between 30-40 feet.</ref>

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:'Fell Beast' increases the number of strikes of one Nazgûl hazard-creature. 'Wild Fell Beast' is a Drake which attacks with three strikes. With the card 'Fell Rider' the Ringwraith may move to a non-Darkhaven site (without allies and followers). 

'''2001-3: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The fell beasts are depicted as more [[Dragons|Dragon]]-like and serpentine, i.e., their heads appear more like a snake's and they do not have beaks. This depiction came largely from [[John Howe]]'s influence.

:In the films, the fell beasts are used for attack much more often than in the books, with the Nazgûl usually swooping down and screeching, making the defenders at the gate of Minas Tirith run away, leaving [[Gandalf]] alone to face the Witch-king as he enters.

:Although on screen the films never make this mistake, sometimes cast or crew members ([[Lawrence Makoare]] and [[Richard Taylor]] most notably) on the commentary tracks and the documentaries refer to the fell beasts as Nazgûl; this is incorrect. The fell beasts are the creature that the nine Nazgûl ride, and the mistake probably arose because fell beasts are always seen with a Nazgûl atop them.

'''2001-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:The Fell Beasts are portrayed without beaks, reminiscent of the depiction<!-- visual interpretation by User:Morgan --> in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy''.<ref>[http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/productDetail.jsp?prodId=prod480006a&amp;_requestid=1321389 Winged Nazgûl] at [http://www.games-workshop.com/ Games-workshop.com] (accessed 10 June 2011)</ref>

'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''
:Hell-hawks, employed as mounts by the Ringwraiths and found wild in southern Mirkwood and (after the War of the Ring) in Gondor, resemble a "cross between lizards and featherless birds". They were bred by Sauron in mockery of the [[Eagles|Great Eagles]].<ref>{{D|Fell}}, pp. 30-31</ref>

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Agandaûr has several Fell beasts under his control. At the end of Chapter 1, Agandaûr flees on the back of one of them.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>
