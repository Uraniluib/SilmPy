'''Galdor''' was an [[Elves|Elf]], who lived in [[Gondolin]] during the [[First Age]], and was the leader of the [[Folk of the Tree]]. He was said to be the bravest Elf of Gondolin, save King [[Turgon]] himself.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref> He carried either a great [[clubs|club]] or spear, and wore green.  After the [[Fall of Gondolin]] he fled southwards to the [[Mouths of Sirion]], after leading the scouts before the exiles on their escape. It is said he later returned to the [[Undying Lands]], and dwelt on [[Tol EressÃ«a]].<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In late writings, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] considered that Galdor of the Tree and [[Galdor of the Havens]] may have been the same,<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, note 1</ref> but ultimately rejected the notion. If Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus had fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, note 3</ref> For this reason Tolkien speculated that "Galdor" was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.
