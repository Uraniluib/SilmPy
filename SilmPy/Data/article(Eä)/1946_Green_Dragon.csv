The '''Green Dragon''' was one of the many inns of [[the Shire]]. It was located in [[Bywater]] on the [[Bywater Road]] and was the building nearest to [[Hobbiton]],<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|VI8}}</ref> being one mile south-east from the bridge over [[the Water]] that led to [[Bag End]].<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> As such, [[Hobbits]] from both villages could be seen there.

==History==
In {{TA|2941}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> when [[Bilbo Baggins]] looked at the letter that [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] had left on his mantelpiece after the Unexpected Party, he found that he only had ten minutes to arrive punctually for the 11 a.m. start of the quest to the [[Lonely Mountain]] at the Green Dragon Inn. Bilbo made it, barely, and found that the [[Thorin and Company]] were packed and ready to go.<ref name="Mutton"/>

On [[12 April]] {{TA|3018|n}}, the same day that [[Gandalf]] returned to the Shire after many years,<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Samwise Gamgee]] was visiting the Green Dragon when the talk turned to Tree-men, one of whom had been seen by Sam's [[Halfast Gamgee|cousin Hal]]. Although queer tales had begun to be heard in the Shire the hobbits at the inn, especially [[Ted Sandyman]], laughed at Sam's story.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>

When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and Sam returned to Bywater on [[2 November]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> they found the Green Dragon closed with broken windows and a half dozen [[Ruffians]] loitering nearby. When they insulted Frodo the other three hobbits drove the men away.<ref name="Scouring"/>

After the Ruffians and [[Saruman|Sharkey]] had either been killed or driven away the Green Dragon Inn was undoubtedly restored.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the original version of [[Thorin]]'s letter to Bilbo, the rendezvous point for the start of the journey to the [[Lonely Mountain]] was the [[Old Mill|Great Mill]].<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref>  Not long before the story was published this was changed to the inn, first named the Green Man and finally the Green Dragon.<ref name="TrollNotes">{{HH|Trolls}}, note 2, p. 98</ref>
