'''Naugladur''' was the king of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
He led the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|attack]] against [[Menegroth]] to capture the [[Nauglafring]]. Later he fought with [[Beren]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] and would have slain him, but stumbled and Beren slew him to reclaim the Nauglafring.  With his dying words he cursed the treasure that he was bringing back to Nogrod, which Beren dumped in the river.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Naugladur'' was never explained by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], but it is likely a [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]] name meaning "King [of the] Dwarves".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D.
