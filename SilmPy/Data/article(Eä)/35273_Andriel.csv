==History==
===Life as a Lore-master===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings- War in the North - Concept Art of Andriel1.png|250px|thumb|left|Concept Art of Andriel.]]Andriel was born in [[Rivendell]], and already in her youth she was skilled in healing and [[Magic]]. [[Elrond]] taught her more about magic and lore, while [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] taught her about weapons and combat. While living in Rivendell she met [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]]. After her training was complete she was sent many times to the wilderness of [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]] by Elrond, to gather information about the world. Therefore, she has wandered much through the regions surrounding Rivendell. During these wanderings she has made contact with the [[Rangers of the North]], including [[Halbarad]] and [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]].<ref name="Backstory Andriel"/>

In September {{TA|3018}} she [[Wandering Companies|accompenied]] [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] to the [[Emyn Beraid]], to look in the [[Elostirion-stone|Palantír]], and visit their kin in [[Lindon]]. Near [[Bree]], Andriel got a premonition that something would happen in the south. She left the company and travelled through the [[Andrath]] to [[Sarn Ford]]. There she did speak with Halbarad, who did have the same feelings and had ordered his men to make barricades.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=25 December 2011}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
When the [[Nazgûl]] attacked the guard that morning Andriel assisted the Rangers, together with Eradan and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]]. They were defeated and many of the rangers were killed. Shortly after the attack the [[Witch-king]] meets with [[Agandaûr]]. Where the latter tells he had summoned the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and has assembled an army in [[Fornost]]. The Witch-king sends him back to Fornost, to attack immediately.<ref name="Prologue">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

Halbarad sent her, together with Eradan and Farin, to [[Bree]], where they have to warn Aragorn. The three companions meet him in the [[Prancing Pony]]. After they told him about the conservation, he sends them immediately to Fornost to stop Agandaûr before he attacks.<ref name="Prologue"/>

The three travelled to [[Fornost Erain]], where they freed a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]] - Beleram - and met with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], who were sent by [[Elrond|their father]] to uncover the darkness in Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref><ref name="Inner wards">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> Andriel, being an acquaintance of the twins, introduces her two companions and explains about their mission to stop Agandaûr's army. They team up with Beleram and the sons of [[Elrond]] to kill Agandaûr. On their way to the citadel they take seperate roads and defeat several ambushes of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]].<ref name="Inner wards"/>

[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Andriel&Goblins.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Andriel fights [[Goblins]] in [[Fornost]].]]At the gate - [[Magic|magically]] protected by Agandaûr against intruders - they again join the sons of Elrond. While the twins remove the spell from the gate, Andriel and her companions protect them against an attack of [[Orcs]] and a [[Trolls|Troll]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref> In the citadel tower they overhead Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], the chieftain of the Orcs of [[Mount Gram]], who speak about intruders. While they attempt to follow Agandaûr, Tharzog notices them and commands his servants to close a gate. This seperates Andriel, Eradan and Farin again from Elladan and Elrohir. While the twins go onward, Andriel and her companions fight and kill Tharzog and his guard.<ref name="Tower">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel tower''</ref>

After the death of Tharzog the three heroes go to the top of the citadel tower, where they find Agandaûr fighting the Sons of Elrond. Although Agandaûr had the upper hand in the fight, he could not defeat Andriel, Eradan, Farin and the sons of Elrond at the same time and flees on the back of a [[Fell beast]]. Beleram pursues Agandaûr, but the latter creates a thunderstorm above Fornost. After being hit by a lightning, Beleram draws back and returns to the tower. Here, Andriel and her companions speak with the Eagle about the events in Fornost. Andriel returns to [[Sarn Ford]] with Eradan and Farin, while Elladan and Elrohir go back to [[Rivendell]] and Beleram returns to his [[Lord of the Eagles|lord]], [[Gwaihir]].<ref name="Tower"/>
