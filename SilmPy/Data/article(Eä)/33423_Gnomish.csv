'''Gnomish''', also called '''Goldogrin''' or '''I-Lam na-Ngoldathon''' ("The language of the Noldoli"), was the language of the [[Gnomes]] spoken in the [[Great Lands]].

This language was the first incarnation of the [[Celtic]]-like [[Elvish]] language invented by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] during the first drafts of his [[Legendarium]] during [[1917]] and later. The language would evolve into the language known as [[Noldorin]] around [[1930]] and finally envisioned as [[Sindarin|the language of the Sindar]] during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Unlike [[Sindarin]], and like [[Quenya]], Goldogrin was an inflected language with a full case system; For example, the genitive plural "of the Gnomes" is ''Ngoldathon'' as seen above. The ending ''-on'' is also known from later Quenya. It is also seen in later names such as [[Caras Galadhon]] (said to be [[Silvan Elvish]]) and perhaps [[Dorthonion]].

Gnomish is notable for being one of the very few languages by Tolkien about which he proceeded into assembling a definite [[Gnomish Lexicon|lexicon]] and grammar notes (published in [[Parma Eldalamberon 11|''Parma Eldalamberon'', issue 11]]).

Since Sindarin is a continuous revision of Gnomish, it kept its Celtic phonology, some common grammar elements (like the ''[[-in]]'' plural ending and Welsh style mutations) and much of the vocabulary (eg. ''[[lam]]'' "language", ''[[mab]]'' "hand", ''[[gloss]]'' "white"). 

Several Gnomish words seem like they would derive from [[Sundocarme|roots]] known from the ''[[Etymologies]]'' or that they would belong to a dialect of Sindarin; for example the word ''gweg'' "man" could have been a Sindarin word derived from [[WEG]] (see [[Denweg]]).
