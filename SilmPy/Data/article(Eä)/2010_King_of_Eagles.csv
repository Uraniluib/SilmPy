'''King of Eagles''' was a title given to [[Thorondor]], the gigantic and noble eagle of the [[First Age]], whose talons wounded the face of [[Morgoth]] himself. [[Thorondor]] dwelt among the peaks of the [[Crissaegrim]], guarding [[Turgon]]'s Hidden City of [[Gondolin]] from the forces of Morgoth until that city's Fall, and he came to the aid of the [[Elves]] many times during the First Age. 

In [[The Hobbit]], we meet a character who carries the title 'Lord of Eagles', a title that was also borne by Thorondor in the [[Elder Days]]. Whether the title of 'King of Eagles' was also passed down through the Ages like this cannot be known - in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s other writings, it is only ever used of Thorondor himself.
