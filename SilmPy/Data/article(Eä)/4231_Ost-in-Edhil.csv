'''Ost-in-Edhil''' ({{SA|750}} – {{SA|1697|N}}, existed for c. 947 years) was the capital city of [[Eregion]], a kingdom of [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]] in [[Eriador]]. It lay where the rivers [[Sirannon]] and [[Glanduin]] met.

==History==
Ost-in-Edhil was founded by [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]], before the time they ruled [[Lothlórien]].<ref name=Galadriel>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> The Elves began trading with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and built a large road to connect the city with the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] of the Dwarven kingdom.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> The Elves of Eregion also traded with the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]]. After the Númenóreans founded the city of [[Tharbad]] to the south of Ost-in-Edhil, Galadriel is recorded meeting with [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] before he took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor|Sceptre]].

In time the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], a brotherhood of Elven craftsmen, was founded. They were led by [[Celebrimbor]], the greatest smith since [[Fëanor]]. Sometime after {{SA|1350}} Galadriel left for Lothlórien and Celebrimbor became Lord of Ost-in-Edhil.

In {{SA|1200|n}} a mysterious craftsman named [[Annatar]] came to the city, offering his considerable talents. For 400 years they learned from him and together forged many [[Rings of Power]]. Annatar was, in truth, [[Sauron]], who returned to [[Mordor]] to forge [[the One Ring]]. In {{SA|1695|n}} the Dark Lord returned with an army of [[Orcs]] and began the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. In {{SA|1697|n}} Celebrimbor was slain<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> and [[Sack of Eregion|Ost-in-Edhil was completely destroyed]].<ref name=Galadriel/>

Centuries later the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] encountered the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil shortly before reaching [[Moria]].<ref name=South/>

==Etymology==
Ost-in-Edhil is [[Sindarin]] for "Fortress of the Elves" from ''[[ost]]'' "fortress" and ''[[edhel|edhil]]'' "elves".{{fact}}
