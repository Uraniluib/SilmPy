'''''-lma''''' pronominal [[Quenya]] ending meaning "our", attested (with the genitive ending ''[[-o]]'' that displaces final ''-a'') in the word ''omentielmo'' "of our meeting". This "our" is plural inclusive.

[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] (it seems) improperly used it in the greeting "a star shines on the hour of our meeting": since he and the Elf he was speaking to constituted only two persons, he should have used the ''dual'' inclusive instead. The correct form '''omentielvo''' occurs in some of the manuscripts of the Red Book.<ref>{{L|205|2}}</ref>
