The '''Wandering Days''' was the term used by [[Hobbits]] to refer to the centuries-long period of their westward migration from their races' ancestral home somewhere in the wild East (probably in the upper [[Vales of Anduin]]).<ref name="Hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

The oral history and memory of the Hobbits did not extend further back than their "Wandering Days", with their exact origins having been lost. So the first known historical fact is that they were alerted by the rise of [[Dol Guldur]] and [[Angmar]], so they drifted westward. Around {{TA|1050}} many [[Harfoots]] settled in [[Eriador]] and about {{TA|1150|n}} the [[Fallohides]] followed, while many [[Stoors]] who emerged from the [[Redhorn Pass]] settled near [[Tharbad]] in [[Dunland]], specifically [[Angle (Eriador)|the Angle]]. In {{TA|1300|n}} the northern Hobbits had to flee from [[Angmar]] and some Stoors (in {{TA|1356|n}}) returned to the [[Gladden Fields|Gladden]]. The others continued westward and their first settlements were in [[Bree]] and [[Staddle]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Eventually, in the year {{TA|1601}} a large population of [[Bree-hobbits]] was granted permission by King [[Argeleb II]],<ref name="TA"/> one of the last few Kings of [[Arthedain]], to colonize the region beyond the [[Brandywine]], and were later joined by the Stoors of Dunland. This would become [[The Shire]], the main homeland of most of Hobbit-kind.<ref name="Hobbits"/>
