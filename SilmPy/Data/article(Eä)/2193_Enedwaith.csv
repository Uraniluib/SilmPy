'''Enedwaith''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈnedwa͡ɪθ]}}), also spelled '''Enedhwaith''' (pron. {{IPA|[eˈneðwa͡ɪθ]}}), the '''Central Wilderness'''<ref name=n76/>, originally referred to both a region of [[Middle-earth]] between [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and the men that inhabited it; the region Enedwaith retained that name even when the Enedwaith people were no more.

==Geography==
Enedwaith can be roughly defined as the region between [[Arnor]] ([[Eriador]]) and the northern parts of [[Gondor]] ([[Calenardhon]]), and was nominally shared by both, although it wasn't settled by the [[Dúnedain]].<ref name=n76/>

The boundaries of the Enedwaith were defined in the north by the rivers [[Gwathló]] and [[Glanduin]], to the east by the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], and to the west by [[Belegaer]]. The southern border was less clear, but was probably formed by the river [[Isen]].<Ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[First Age|First]] and early [[Second Age]] Enedwaith was deeply forested, but the arrival of the timber-hungry [[Númenóreans]], from the seventh century of the Second Age onwards, devastated the landscape.

The Enedwaith themselves "were forest dwellers, scattered communities without central leadership." They were distantly related to the [[Haladin]] of old, but this wasn't recognized in time by Númenóreans, who were mainly descended from the First and Third Houses of the [[Edain]], and therefore spoke a language which was not related.<Ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> The Enedwaith were not ranked as [[Middle Men]], friends and distant kin of the Edain, but were ranked among the "people of darkness", enemies and aliens.

The denuded forests of Enedwaith, and much of those to the north in Eriador, were finally destroyed by the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] around {{SA|1700}}, during which much of what had survived the felling was burnt. Only remote corners like [[Eryn Vorn]] survived in Eriador, and the [[Old Forest]] still further north. Many surviving natives took refuge in the eastern highlands of Enedwaith, "the foothills of the Misty Mountains", which ultimately became [[Dunland]].

After {{SA|3320}}, Enedwaith formed the most northern part of the new Kingdom of [[Gondor]], at least officially. The south-east was still "in places well-wooded", but elsewhere Enedwaith was by this time "mostly grassland."

Enedwaith was said not to belong to either [[Arnor]] or [[Gondor]], sharing an interest in that region. The hold was nominal as it wasn't settled by them, due to the hostility of the [[Gwathuirim]]. The only settlement was a fortified town and haven at [[Tharbad]], a garrison populated by soldiers, mariners and engineers.<ref name=n76/><ref name=6d>{{UT|6d}}</ref>

Following the [[Great Plague]] in {{TA|1636}} the region fell quickly into decay; and back into wild fenlands<ref name="Galadriel">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> however, Gondor's authority permanently lapsed throughout the region. At some point the [[Isen]] marked the western bounds of Gondor but it was of little concern other than the patrolling and upkeep of the great [[Royal Road]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

[[Tharbad]], originally one of two ancient cities on the Gwathló, and the only one to survive beyond the early [[Third Age]], was finally abandoned following devastating floods in {{TA|2912}}, and thereafter, only two groups survived in Enedwaith: the [[Dunlendings]] in the far east, and a "fairly numerous but barbarous fisher-folk" wandering the coast.<ref name=6d/>

==Etymology==
Also spelled Enedhwaith. The name Enedwaith means "middle folk" or "middle region" in [[Sindarin]] from ''[[enedh]]'' meaning "middle" and ''[[gwaith]]'' which means "people" but is also used for regions.

The form "Enedwaith" appears in the [[General Map of Middle-earth]], but [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] suggested "Enedhwaith" in his annotations to [[Pauline Baynes]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=5 August 2018}}</ref>

While writing ''[[Of Dwarves and Men]]'' Tolkien typed "Enedwaith" and subsequently added ''h'' manually on the typed text, until he started typing "Enedhwaith" which he maintained in ''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]''. [[Christopher Tolkien]] preferred the spelling "Enedwaith" for the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' for agreement with the published ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #66</ref>
