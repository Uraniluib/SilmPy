The '''Red Arrow''' was a way [[Gondor]] summoned its allies in time of need.

==Description==
Its flights were black and its barbs were made of steel, and it took its name from a mark of red painted on the arrow's tip,<ref name="Muster">{{RK|V3}}</ref> standing for blood to show the situation was serious. The black flights were like the [[Orcs|Orc]] arrows.

==History==
First mention of the Red Arrow is when [[Borondir]] of Gondor and five other messengers rode north along [[Anduin]] to seek out Gondor's old allies, the [[Éothéod]], when Gondor was being overrun by [[Easterlings]], in {{TA|2509}}. Borondir was the only survivor, and presented the Red Arrow to the Éothéod King [[Eorl the Young]].

It is not certain where the Red Arrow came from: it is possible that the tradition was an old one and that Gondor had always summoned its allies this way, but another possibility is that Borondir actually took an Orc arrow with a bloody tip to present to the Éothéod, to prove that the situation was as bad as his message stated.

On [[9 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> it became a summons for the [[Rohirrim]]. The Red Arrow was presented to [[Rohan]] by [[Hirgon]] in the [[War of the Ring]], and [[Théoden]] King rode out with the [[Muster of Rohan]] to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name="Muster"/>

==Inspiration==
It has been noted that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s concept of the use of a red arrow by Gondor to summon the Rohirrim to war is very reminiscent of a similar use in ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'', a novel by [[William Morris]], which Tolkien owned and from which he took inspiration.<ref name=CGMorris>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', "Morris, William", p. 600</ref>
