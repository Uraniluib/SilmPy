'''Brandy Hall''' was in the center of [[Buckland]] on the east bank of the River [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] near the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  It was a [[Smials|smial]] deeply-delved into [[Buck Hill]] and was the ancestral home of the [[Brandybuck Family]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  

==History==
[[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] began the first excavations of Brandy Hall in {{TA|2340}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

The Brandybucks kept making additions to Brandy Hall until it occupied the whole of the hill, had three large front doors, many side-doors, and about a hundred windows.  When the Brandybucks and numerous dependents outgrew Brandy Hall they burrowed and built all around Buck Hill.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>

In {{TA|2980|n}} [[Frodo Baggins]]' parents, [[Drogo Baggins]]<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> and [[Primula Brandybuck]],<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> died in a boating accident.  Frodo then lived in Brandy Hall until {{TA|2989|n}} when his ninety-nine year old cousin, [[Bilbo Baggins]], invited him to come live at [[Bag End]].<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>

By the end of the first century of the [[Fourth Age]] Brandy Hall contained one of the largest collection of historical books and records, in particular many works dealing with [[Eriador]] and the history of [[Rohan]].  Some of the works composed or begun by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and kept in the Brandy Hall library were ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'', the ''[[Reckoning of Years]]'', and the short treatise ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>
