'''Dírhael''' was one of the [[Dúnedain of the North]].

==History==
Dírhael was a descendant of [[Aranarth]], the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain. He was married to [[Ivorwen]], and their daughter was [[Gilraen]], whose hand was sought by [[Arathorn II|Arathorn]], at that time heir to Chieftain [[Arador]]. Dírhael at first opposed the marriage, but Ivorwen persuaded him to allow it. Just two years later, Dírhael's grandson was born: [[Aragorn]], who would one day rule the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of the [[Dúnedain]].<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>
