'''Nunduinë''' was a river of [[Númenor]], the second longest after the [[Siril]]. It flowed westward out of the central regions of the island, and as it approached the sea, its waters spread to form the fragrant lake of [[Nísinen]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Its mouth was at the haven of [[Eldalondë]], on the shores of the [[Bay of Eldanna]].<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref>

==Etymology==

[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that ''Nunduinë'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "Western River", consisting of ''nún-'' ("western") + [[luine|''-duinë'']] ("river").<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 31</ref>
