'''Apes''' were animals living far South of [[Middle-earth]]. 

Said to live in the dark forests of the South,<ref>{{HM|TT}}, "[[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]]"</ref> they seem to have only been known in stories in the North. Probably due to their lesser intelligence, the word "ape", along with "maggot" and ''[[snaga]]'', became an insult used by [[Orcs]].<ref name="UH">{{HM|TT}}, "[[The Uruk-hai]]"</ref>
