The '''Hither Lands''' was a name for [[Middle-earth]]; the lands of mortals as opposed to [[Aman]], the [[Undying Lands]].<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

On [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s earliest maps of [[Arda]], the term "Hither Lands" was written across both Middle-earth and the southern continent that would eventually contain [[Harad]]. Lacking a definite name for this southern landmass, "Hither Lands" is occasionally used by fans.
