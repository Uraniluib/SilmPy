The '''Vanyar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈvaɲar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈβaɲar]}}) are one of the three groups of [[Calaquendi|High Elves]], along with the [[Noldor]], and some of the [[Teleri]] (more specifically, the [[Falmari]]). They comprise most of those who did not leave Aman.

== History==
According to legend, the clan was founded by [[Imin]], the first [[Elves|Elf]] to awake in [[Cuiviénen]], his wife [[Iminyë]], and their twelve companions. At this time, they were called the '''Minyar''' (Q: "first ones", pron. {{IPA|[ˈmiɲar]}}). 

However, it was [[Ingwë]], the first Vanya to travel with [[Oromë]] to [[Valinor]], who became their king. Always eager to reach Valinor, none of the Vanyar [[Avari|refused to go]] and were on the vanguard of the [[Great March]]; they reached [[Beleriand]] first and sailed on the first voyage of [[Tol Eressëa]] with the [[Noldor]].<ref name=s3/> 

At first the Vanyar dwelt in [[Tirion]] with the [[Noldor]], but they loved the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] and settled in the plains and woods [[Valinor]] or the slopes of [[Taniquetil]].<ref name=princes/> Their King Ingwë became the ''[[High King of the Elves]]'' and lived on Taniquetil beneath the halls of [[Manwë]].<ref name=princes>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

After the release of [[Melkor]], they were suspicious of him, being content within the [[Light of Valinor]].<ref>{{S|6}}</ref> In the [[Darkening of Valinor]] they were next to the [[Valar]] and [[Maiar]] inside the [[Ring of Doom]].<ref>{{S|8}}</ref>

A notable Vanya was [[Indis]], the second wife of [[Finwë]] and mother of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]]. It is from her Vanyarin blood that some Noldor, like [[Galadriel]], gained their golden hair. Other than those Noldor, all Vanyar were content to remain in Valinor and few were ever seen in [[Middle-earth]],<ref name=s3>{{S|3}}</ref> as they only returned with the [[Host of Valinor]] for the [[War of Wrath]].<ref name=war>{{S|24}}</ref>

== Description ==
The Vanyar were the first and smallest clan of the Elves, being only fourteen in number in their beginning.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}} p. 381</ref> All among them had blond hair. They were the most beloved by [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]]<ref name=s3/><ref name=princes/> and the Elder King gave them his gift of poetry and song.<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

In the War of Wrath they held white banners<ref name=war/> and it is said they preferred spears instead of swords and bows.<ref name=spear/>

==Names==
The Vanyar called themselves '''''Minyar''''', "the Firsts", their ancient name. Another name was '''''Ingar''''' or '''''Ingwer''''' which means "Chieftains" (etymologically related to the name [[Ingwë]]). 

In [[Sindarin]] they were called [[Miniel|Minil]].

The Vanyar also known under the name "'''Fair-elves'''",<ref name="s3" /> from the fair colour of their hair.<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Vanyar''</ref> They were also known as the "'''Light-elves'''".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref> 

In he earliest form of the legendarium, they are also called the "Spear-elves" for their love of spears, as opposed to the sword and shield of the Noldor and the bow and arrow of the [[Solosimpi]].<ref name=spear>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 215 footnote to §29</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Vanyar'' means "the Fair" in [[Quenya]], referring to their golden hair. It seems to be from a [[primitive Elvish]] form ''[[bányâ]]''<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 351</ref><ref>{{HM|PM}}, p. 402</ref> (stem [[BAN]]) but also from ''[[wanjâ]]'' (stem [[WAN]])<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, p. 383</ref>. The Teleri called them [[Baniai]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In the earliest versions of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[legendarium]] (see: ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''), the first clan were called '''''Teleri''''' and '''''Lindar''''', names that later were given to the third clan instead (the Elves known as [[Teleri]] in the published version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' were called ''[[Solosimpi]]'' back then).

In the [[The Lhammas|''Lhammas'']] (1930s), ''Ingwi'' was a name for an early conception of the Lindar; this name reappeared only once, years later, in the late manuscript ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' (ca. 1968), as [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 332, 356 (note 3)</ref>
