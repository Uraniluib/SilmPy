}}'''Hardang''' was a Chieftain of the [[Men of Brethil]] in the [[First Age]]. 
==History==
He descended from [[Halmir]] of the [[House of Haleth]]. Hardang was the son of [[Hundad]] who was the son of [[Hundar]]. After the death of the Chieftain of Brethil, [[Handir]], Hardang tried to have his cousin, [[Brandir]] dismissed of  the throne in favor of himself. Many believed Brandir was unfit to rule and supported Hardang. 

After the death of Brandir a new Chieftain had to be elected. As Brandir had no children the [[Folk of Brethil]] wished for his cousin [[Manthor]] to take up the line, however they were connected by a daughter, and thus Hardang won the election. Hardang promoted Manthor to become the Captain of the Guards at the [[Crossings of Taeglin]].

Within two years of Hardang's ruling, rumors of the return of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] began spreading. As Hardang disliked the [[House of Hador]] for he had no blood relation. Upon Húrin's return, at the [[Moot of the Folk]] Manthor defended Húrin against Hardang.

The [[Folk of Brethil]] were angered by Hardang actions and burned the [[Hall of the Chieftains]]. Hardang attempted to escape but was hit with a spear in  his back and he perished.
