{{Pronounce|Edoras.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Edoras''' was the capital of [[Rohan]] that held the Golden Hall of [[Meduseld]]. 

==History==
Rohan's first capital was at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]], until [[Rulers of Rohan|King]] [[Eorl]] the Young or his son [[Brego]] built Edoras. 

[[Wulf]] son of [[Freca]] the Dunlending, invaded Rohan in {{TA|2758}} and took Edoras usurping the throne in [[Meduseld]].  But the [[Long Winter]], which had lasted five long months, ended and [[Fréaláf]] son of [[Hild]] came out of [[Dunharrow]] and with a small band of men, surprising Wulf, he attacked '''Edoras''' and slew Wulf, regaining the city.

It was here that [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gandalf]] the White met with [[Théoden]].

==Geography==
The city was built on a hill in [[Harrowdale]], a valley of the [[White Mountains]] which lay under the great mountain [[Starkhorn]]. The river [[Snowbourn]] flowed past Edoras on its way west towards the [[Entwash]].

Edoras was encircled by a wall, and a dike dug around the hill. It had a spring whose water flowed in a channel along the main road.

Outside, there was the [[Barrowfield]], with the tombs of the [[Kings of Rohan|Rulers of Rohan]] arrayed in two lines by the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Simbelmynë]] grew there. A rutted road led from the city past Snowbourn.

==Etymology==
The name ''Edoras'' is said to mean "the courts" in the Mark-speech of Rohan.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 247</ref>

In [[Old English]], ''edoras'' (plural of ''[[Wiktionary:eodor|edor, eodor]]'') means "dwellings, houses".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 247</ref>
