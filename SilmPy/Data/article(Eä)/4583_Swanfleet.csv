The '''Swanfleet''' or '''Nîn-in-Eilph''' was a marshy area in eastern [[Eriador]] through which the lower reaches of the [[Glanduin]] (or "Swanfleet river") flowed before it joined the [[Mitheithel]] (Hoarwell).<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> The Swanfleet was effectively an inland delta, with uncertain streams and a very uncertain difference between land and water.

It strongly resembled the [[Gladden Fields]] on the other side of [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], and as such many [[Stoors]] felt right at home here after their migration into [[Eriador]]. These Stoors remained here until the [[Great Plague]] nearly wiped them out, and the remainder then went to the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].

At the east end of the Swanfleet was a waterfall, beyond which was a ford over the Glanduin,<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> from where led a road to the ruins of [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the ruined city of [[Eregion]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' is [[Sindarin]] for "water-lands of the Swans".<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 7</ref>
