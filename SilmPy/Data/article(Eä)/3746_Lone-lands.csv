The '''Lone-lands''' was an area in [[Eriador]], or may even have been synonymous with it.

==History==
The Lone-lands was a name used by [[Hobbits]] (and possibly the [[Bree-landers]]) for the wilderness east of [[Bree-land]]. This area contained, among other features, the [[Weather Hills]] and [[Weathertop]]. Roads were considerably worse there than in [[the Shire]], and no one dwelt there anymore by the end of the [[Third Age]]. There were many abandoned castles of [[Rhudaur]] in the hilly region, which gave it a wicked look.<ref name="Mutton">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[Roast Mutton]]" (Second edition)</ref>

==Lone-lands and Eriador==
It is a subject of some debate whether the Lone-lands and Eriador are one and the same. Etymologies given for ''Eriador'' certainly suggest such a thing.<ref name="vt42">Fredrik Ström, [[Carl F. Hostetter]] (ed.), "Letters to VT", ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'', [[Vinyar Tengwar 42|vol. 42]], July [[2001]], p. 4</ref><ref name="pe17">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Words, Phrases and Passages in The Lord of the Rings" in [[Parma Eldalamberon]] (ed. Christopher Gilson), [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|vol. 17]], July [[2007]], p. 28</ref> The two mentions of "Lone-lands" were not added until the revised, [[1966]] edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas Anderson]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', "A: Books by J.R.R. Tolkien", pp. 30-31</ref> well after the introduction of the word "Eriador" in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[Strider (chapter)|Strider]]"</ref> As the latter was spoken by [[Aragorn]], who would know the [[Sindarin]] name, and the former by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], who would not (yet) know the "foreign" name, it is not inconceivable that they refer to the same land.<ref name="vt42"/>

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:"Lone-lands" is a name given to the area south of [[Weathertop]].

'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:The narrator mentions the Lone-lands when [[Thorin and Company]] travel from Hobbiton to the [[Trollshaws]].<ref>[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]], "Roast Mutton"</ref> Also, the game's soundtrack contains a piece called "Combat in the Lone-lands", which accompanies [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s trek to the campfire of the Trolls.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The name "Lone-lands" refers explicitly to the region between [[Bree-land]] and the [[Trollshaws]]. Its boundaries are [[The Forsaken Inn]] in the far west and the [[Last Bridge]] at the far east. The game goes around the pre-existing mention of the region being uninhabited by making its people, the Eglain (Sindarin for "Foresaken"), shun existing society and avoid attention by travelers.
