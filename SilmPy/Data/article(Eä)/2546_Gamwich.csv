'''Gamwich''' was a village in [[the Shire]].<ref group=note>Gamwich is one of the locations not included in the published map ''[[A Part of the Shire]]''. [[Karen Fonstad]] placed it near the borders of the [[Westfarthing]], but this is only speculation. See {{HM|AME}}, Regional Maps, The Shire</ref>  

It was the home town of [[Hamfast of Gamwich|Hamfast Gamwich]] (and the source of his chosen surname) and as such the origin of the [[Gamwich Family|Gamwich]] and the [[Gammidge Family|Gammidge]] (later [[Gamgee]]) families. The town was also known for its own rope-making.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Gamwich is "translated" from [[Hobbitish]] ''[[Galabas]]'' meaning "game-village"<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

[[David Salo]] has suggested that the name represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Gamenwic'' "Game-village".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
