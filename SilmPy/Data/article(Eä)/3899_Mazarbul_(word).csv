'''''Mazarbul''''' means "written documents, records" in [[Khuzdul]].
==Etymology==
The word has a probable root *ZRB, "write, inscribe".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>

If so, it also contains a prefix ''ma-'' which perhaps denotes perfect tense, and the suffix ''[[-ul]]''.<ref>Magnus Auberg, [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish]</ref>
