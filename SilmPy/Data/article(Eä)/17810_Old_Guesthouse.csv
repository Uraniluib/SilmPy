The '''Old Guesthouse''' was an inn in [[Minas Tirith]]. It was located on the first tier, on [[Lampwrights' Street]]. It was surrounded on three sides by a lawn, and the fourth was open, leading out to the street.

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] met [[Bergil]] here. The inn's fate is not known, but it could have been destroyed in the [[Siege of Minas Tirith]]. <ref>{{RK|V1}}.</ref>
