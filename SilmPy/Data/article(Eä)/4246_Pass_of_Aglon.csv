The '''Pass of Aglon''' (or just '''Aglon'''), also called the '''Gorge of Aglon'''<ref name=GA242/>, was the pass between [[Dorthonion]] and the uplands west of [[Himring]], to the north-east of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

It was about six leagues in length, with the western side bordering the [[Dorthonion]] Plateau rising in very high steep walls. It was chilly since a bitter wind continuously blew through the pass from the lands to the north.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==History==
Two of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], heavily fortified this area, augmented by extra forces in [[Himlad]]. About ten leagues to the east, the pair's elder brother [[Maedhros]] had built upon the [[Hill of Himring]] his stronghold, thus protecting this weak point in the chain of kingdoms created by the [[Noldor]] after the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (Battle-under-Stars).<ref name="Beleriand"/>

In {{FA|455}}<ref>{{GA|148}}</ref> during the [[Dagor Bragollach]] [[Orcs]] broke through Celegorm and Curufin's fortifications, leaving Maedhros' stronghold the centre for re-grouping of Fëanor's sons. They later took back the Pass.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> However, after [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] in {{FA|472|n}}<ref>{{GA|219}}</ref> the Sons of Fëanor were scattered, the Pass of Aglon fell under [[Morgoth]]'s domination,<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> and it was garrisoned by Orcs.<ref name=GA242>{{GA|242}}</ref> The Pass was never recovered, along with all of the land of northern Beleriand.

==Etymology==
''Aglon'' means "the Narrow Pass".<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Aglon''</ref>
