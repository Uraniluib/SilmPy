The '''Great Market''' was a large market on the east side of [[Gondolin]] mentioned in the ''[[Fall of Gondolin]]''.  It was defended by [[Glorfindel of Gondolin|Glorfindel]] and the [[House of the Golden Flower]] upon the sack of the city, and was burned there.  After the rebellious [[House of the Harp]] threw themselves on the [[orcs]], they were pushed back to this market, where a [[Fire-drake]] consumed many of them.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 182</ref>

Because in the ''Fall'' a west-gate, a north-gate, and a south-gate are all mentioned in, it is not improbable that at this stage in the legendarium Tolkien had also envisioned an east-gate.  This being the case, those coming from the east (deeper in the mountains, and thus possibly where the greater number of the mines were) would come straight onto the Great Market.  This, of course, is purely conjecture.
