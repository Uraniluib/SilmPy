'''Eglarest''' was the southern of the two [[Havens of the Falas]] that lay at the mouth of the River [[Nenning]] on the western coasts of [[Beleriand]]. The northern haven was called [[Brithombar]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> They were founded during the [[Years of the Trees]] by [[CÃ­rdan]]. Upon the cape west of Eglarest [[Finrod]] had built [[Barad Nimras]].<ref>{{S|14}}</ref> The Havens lasted until they were taken by [[Morgoth]] in {{FA|473}}.<ref>{{GA|256}}</ref>
