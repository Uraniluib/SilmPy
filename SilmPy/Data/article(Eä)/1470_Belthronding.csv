'''Belthronding''' was a mighty [[Bows|bow]], made of black yew-wood, that was carried by the most mighty archer of the [[First Age]], [[Beleg]] Strongbow of [[Doriath]]. To it he owed his own epithet, 'Strongbow'. 

With it, he long defended the borders of King [[Thingol]], and when he left [[Doriath]] in search of his friend [[Túrin]], he took it with him. When he found him, together, from the halls of [[Mîm]] in [[Amon Rûdh]], they founded the realm of [[Dor-Cúarthol]] - the Land of Bow and Helm - with him being the 'Bow'. 

When the pair were betrayed to the [[Orcs]], Beleg went to free his friend, but in a tragic turn of fate Túrin mistook him for a foe, and slew him. Overcome with grief, Túrin dug a grave for Beleg's body, and he buried Belthronding beside its late owner.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
