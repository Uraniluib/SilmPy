The '''Siege of Angband''' was the 400-year leaguer of the [[Noldor]] around the fortress of [[Morgoth]] in the early centuries of the [[First Age]], which began following the [[Dagor Aglareb]]. The Noldor and their allies possessed insufficient force to assault [[Angband]] directly. 

In the west [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]] guarded the pass over [[Ered Wethrin]] into [[Hithlum]] from [[Barad Eithel]], while [[Finrod]] and [[Orodreth]] held the pass of Sirion from [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] and [[Angrod]] with [[Aegnor]] held the northern slopes of [[Dorthonion]] to the borders of [[Aglon]]. In the east the Sons of [[Fëanor]] held watch; [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] held the land between the rivers [[Aros]] and [[Celon]], [[Maedhros]] had his stronghold on [[Himring]] while he guarded the Marches north of that hill and the plains between the rivers Celon and [[Gelion]], Maglor kept watch over the northern hills of the river Gelion, and [[Caranthir]] in the shadows of [[Ered Luin]].<ref>{{LR|AB}} pp. 127-8</ref>

It was during the Siege that [[Turgon]]'s people left [[Nevrast]] to build [[Gondolin]]. Other Elven cities, [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were also established by the [[Sindar]] on [[Falas]], and [[Nargothrond]], the realm of [[Finrod]]. The siege was incomplete, as Morgoth was still capable of sending out various forces of orcs to harass the elves, such as the attack of [[Hithlum]]; but the Noldor were grown strong enough, that these task forces posed no significant threat.

After the defeat of [[Glaurung]], a period called [[Long Peace]] begun. The [[Men]] of the [[House of Bëor]] entered [[Beleriand]] and were followed by the [[Haladin]]

Years after the [[Battle of Aglon Pass]], the [[Forest of Brethil]] was given to the Haladin. A final band of Men, the [[House of Hador]], came to Beleriand; they were given the lands of [[Dor-lómin]].

After about four hundred years, the Siege was broken in the [[Dagor Bragollach]].
