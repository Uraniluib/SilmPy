The '''Stoors''' were one of the three breeds of [[Hobbits]].

In their earliest recorded history the Stoors, like the other Hobbits, lived in the [[Vales of Anduin]]. They were a riverside people that dwelt in the [[Gladden Fields]], and were fishermen.<ref name="Hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>
==Characteristics==
They were heavier and broader in build than the other Hobbits, and had large hands and feet. Among the Hobbits, the Stoors most resembled [[Men]] and were most friendly to them. Stoors were the only Hobbits who normally grew facial hair. 

A habit which set them apart from the [[Harfoots]] who lived in the mountain foothills, and the [[Fallohides]] who lived in forests far to the north, was that Stoors preferred flat lands and riversides. Only Stoors used boats, fished, and could swim. They also wore boots in muddy weather.

Stoorish characteristics and appearance remained among the Hobbits of the [[Eastfarthing]], [[Buckland]] (such as the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]]s) and the [[Bree-hobbits]].<ref name="Hobbits"/>

The Stoors also had their [[Stoorish|own dialect]] of [[Hobbitish]], owing to the fact that they spent some time in [[Dunland]] and adopted many strange words and names which they took to [[the Shire]], and retained even until the late Third Age.

==History==
The Stoors are believed to have lived in the southern vales of Anduin. During the Hobbit [[Wandering Days]], after the Harfoots had migrated westward in [[Third Age 1050]], and the Fallohides followed them [[Third Age 1150|about a century later]], the Stoors long remained back in the vale of Anduin, but between {{TA|1150|}} and {{TA|1300|n}} they, too migrated west to [[Eriador]].<ref name="ThirdAge">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Unlike the other Hobbit-kinds they took the [[Redhorn Pass]] and followed a southern route, where many Stoors branched off and moved south to the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle]] of [[Eriador]] south of [[Rivendell]] and mingled with the Harfoots and Fallohides that lived there; but most went to [[Dunland]] ([[Swanfleet]] near [[Tharbad]]) which most resembled their old lands. There they came into contact with the [[Dunlendings]].  This contact altered their speech slightly, mostly by picking up a few Dunlending words.

A hundred years later [[Angmar]] began to threaten Eriador and many Stoors of the Angle fled west and south ({{TA|1356}}<ref name="ThirdAge"/>–{{TA|1409}}<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref group=note>The ''[[Tale of Years]]'' suggests that the migration started or happened around the death of [[Argeleb I]]; ''The North-kingdom'' suggests that it happened during the early reign of [[Araphor]].</ref>) because of the [[Angmar War|wars]] and the evil climate of Eriador; however others returned to [[Rhovanion]].<ref name=eriador/> 

The Stoors of Dunland moved back north to join the other Hobbits in colonizing the Shire about {{TA|1630}} and settled mostly in the [[Eastfarthing]] and [[Southfarthing]].  Some of these villages might have survived until the [[War of the Ring]], when they were sought out by the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>  One result of the Stoorish influx was that places that were settled by Stoors have some slight linguistic oddities, due to their time of separation and contact with the Dunlendings.  The three original Hobbit-kinds merged and blended in the centuries since the settlement of the Shire, but regional variations remained with Stoorish characteristics seen in [[Eastfarthing]] and [[Buckland]].<ref name="Hobbits"/>

Meanwhile their cousins who left for Rhovanion settled the [[Gladden Fields]] by the [[Anduin]], becoming a riverland people of fishers.<ref name=eriador/>  There they had a matriarchal society which [[Déagol]] and [[Sméagol]] belonged to (c. {{TA|2430}}).<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref> What became of those Stoors and whether they rejoined their folk in Eriador, no history tells.

==Etymology==
''Stoor'' is supposed to be a special [[Hobbitish]] word that did not exist in [[Westron]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

Early English ''stor, stoor'' means "large, strong", referring to the fact that these Hobbits were of heavier build.
