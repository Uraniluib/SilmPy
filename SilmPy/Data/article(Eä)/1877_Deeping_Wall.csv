The '''Deeping Wall''' was the solid stone wall, some twenty feet in height and thick enough that four men could walk abreast along the top, that defended the refuges of the [[Rohirrim]] at [[Helm's Deep]]. It lay beneath the castle of the [[Hornburg]], to which it was connected by a flight of steps.<ref name="Helm">{{TT|III7}}</ref> In the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] (on [[3 March]], {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>) it was breached for the only time in its history by a besieging army of [[Orcs]] and [[Dunlendings]], but they were soon driven back and defeated.<ref name="Helm"/>
