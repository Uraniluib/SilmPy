'''Elros''' was a member of the [[Woodland Realm]] and a guard who assisted in the capture of [[Thorin and Company]]. He was also the Keeper of the Keys of [[Thranduil]]'s dungeons. After becoming intoxicated with the king's butler, [[Galion]], Elros loses the keys to the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Later, after [[Thranduil]] had given the order to lock all gates to the kingdom, he informed [[Legolas]] that [[Tauriel]] had left armed with her bow and blade. He was portrayed by the New Zealand actor Robin Kerr.
