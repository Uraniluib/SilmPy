'''Undómë''' was one of the [[Elves]]' names for the hour of star-opening at the end of the day: that is, dusk. [[Undómë]] was the [[Quenya]] name for this time, with the [[Sindarin]] equivalent being [[aduial]]. There was also a poetic [[Mannish]] translation, [[Evendim]] (that is, the dim light of evening).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>  This word is the source of [[Arwen]]'s surname [[Undómiel]], which translates as 'Evenstar'.
