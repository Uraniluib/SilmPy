'''Orod-na-Thôn''' ("Pine-mountain"<ref name="UnfInd">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Unfinished index]]", in {{HM|RC}}, p. 384.</ref> or "Mount of the Pine Tree(s)"<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Eldarin Roots and Stems", in [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|''Parma Eldamaberon'' XVII]] (edited by [[Christopher Gilson]]), 2007, p. 147, entry √ANA/NĀ.</ref>) was a mountain in [[Dorthonion]].<ref name="UnfInd" /> It is mentioned by [[Treebeard]] in his song ''[[In The Willow-meads Of Tasarinan]]'':
:''Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon Orod-na-Thôn!''<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

It has also been assumed that ''Orod-na-Thôn'' is a synonym for ''Dorthonion'' 'Land of Pines',<ref>See e.g. {{HM|Guide}}, p. 92, entry ''Dorthonion''; p. 307, entry ''Orod-na-Thôn''.</ref> but Tolkien states clearly in his unfinished index of place-names occurring in ''The Lord of the Rings'' that it is a separate mountain in this region.

==Etymology==
Elements of the [[Sindarin]] name are:
*''[[orod]]'' 'mountain'<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''orod''.</ref>
