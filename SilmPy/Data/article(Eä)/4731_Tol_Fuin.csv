'''Tol Fuin''' was an island off the coast of [[Forlindon]].

==History==
When the waves consumed [[Beleriand]] and the regions around it after the [[War of Wrath]], not all of the western lands were lost. The highlands that had been [[Dorthonion]], and came to be called [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], in part survived the inrush of the sea, and remained as an island far off the western coasts of Forlindon.<ref>{{TI|C1}}, pp. 124, 138</ref><ref>{{TI|MI}}, pp. 301-2</ref>

==Etymology==
From [[Sindarin]] for Dark Isle from ''[[tol]]'' and ''[[fuin]]''.<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>
