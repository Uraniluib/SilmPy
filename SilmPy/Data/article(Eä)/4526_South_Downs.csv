The '''South Downs''' was a range of hills that ran through the central regions of [[Eriador]]. They were a dreary, empty land with scarce vegetation.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref><ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref>

Walking along the [[East-West Road]] from [[Bree]] to the [[Weather Hills]], one could see the Downs to the south. The [[Greenway]], running through the [[Andrath]], separated the South Downs from the [[Barrow-downs]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[General Map of Middle-earth]]" [map]</ref><ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>
