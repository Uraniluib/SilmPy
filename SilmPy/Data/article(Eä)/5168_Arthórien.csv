'''Arthórien''' was a region in eastern [[Doriath]].

==History==

Arthórien was located between the rivers [[Aros]] and [[Celon]], west of [[Estolad]] and south of [[Himlad]].<ref name=UT/><ref name=WJBeleriand>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, pp. 183, 187, 189</ref> Although what appears to be the same region is also called [[Radhrim]],<ref name=WJBeleriand/> it is unknown if these two regions were the same (or if one was situated within the other).

After [[Denethor]] was killed upon [[Amon Ereb]] in the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], some of the [[Green-elves]] fled to Doriath, apparently seeking the protection of the [[Girdle of Melian]]. These elves, who became known as the [[Guest-elves]], settled in Arthórien.<ref name=UT>{{UT|2d}}</ref><ref name=WJP1>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 112-3</ref>

==Etymology and names==

On a map of Beleriand, the name '''''Garthúrian''''' (could possibly be read as ''Garthúrien'', according to [[Christopher Tolkien]]) is marked as another name for ''Arthórien''.<ref name=WJBeleriand/> The name ''Garthurian'' occurs in early linguistic writings, said to be a "[[Doriathrin]] name of Doriath", meaning "Fenced or Hidden Realm/Kingdom". In the same manuscript, it is said that [[Noldorin]] ''Arthoren'', ''Arthurien'' was a translation of ''Garthurian''.<ref>{{VT|45a}}, pp. 16-7</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 358, 360</ref> A somewhat different version is given in a "philological fragment of uncertain date", where it is written that "the Noldor often used the name ''Arthúrien'' for Doriath, though this is but an alteration of the [[Sindarin]] ''Garthúrian'' 'hidden realm'".<ref name=WJBeleriand/>

Another name used for the region of Arthórien was ''Eglamar''. This usage is noted as a mystery by Christopher Tolkien, as the name usually applies to other concepts (cf. [[Eglamar (disambiguation)]]).<ref name=WJP1/>
