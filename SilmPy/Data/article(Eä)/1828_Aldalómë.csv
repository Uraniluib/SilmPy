'''Aldalómë''' is one of the names of the [[Fangorn Forest]], used by [[Treebeard]] in his song ''[[In The Willow-meads Of Tasarinan|In the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring]]''. The other names mentioned by Treebeard are [[Ambaróna]] and [[Tauremorna]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] notes in his [[Unfinished index]] that it means 'tree-twilight', and refers to Quenya words <i>[[alda]]</i> 'tree' and <i>[[lómë]]</i> 'dimness, twilight, night' (quoted in Scull - Hammond, [[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion|Reader's Companion]], p. 385).
