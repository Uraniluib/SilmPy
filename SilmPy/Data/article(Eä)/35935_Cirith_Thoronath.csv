'''Cirith Thoronath''', the "Eagles' Cleft", pass through the northern part of the [[Echoriad]], the mountains that encircled [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> The Cirith Thoronath was but a narrow and dangerous path with a yawning emptiness next to it.

When the city of Gondolin fell, [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]] led a remnant of the people through a secret passage to the north of the city. After crossing the Vale of [[Tumladen]], hidden by the fume and mists of the destruction, the refugees climbed the dreadful pass that crawled up the side of the highest peaks. As the escapees climbed they were attacked by [[Orcs]] led by a [[Balrogs|Balrog]], for even in this unexpected spot [[Morgoth]] had set watchers

[[Glorfindel]] was with the refugees and fought a great duel with the Balrog upon a pinnacle of rock until both fell into the abyss. Still, all would have been lost if not for the intervention of the [[Eagles]]. They stooped upon the Orcs and slew them or cast them from the Cirith Thoronath. Thus no word of the escape reached Morgoth until long after Gondolin's fall. The eagle [[Thorondor]] bore Glorfindel's body up from the abyss and he was buried in a mound beside the pass.

Cirith Thoronath debouched into the Vale of [[Sirion]], whence the remnants of the people of Gondolin fled to the south.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>
