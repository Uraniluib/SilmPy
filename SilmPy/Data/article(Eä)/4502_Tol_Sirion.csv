'''Tol Sirion''' was the island on the upper reaches of the River [[Sirion]] in the middle of the [[Pass of Sirion]], between the [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Dorthonion]].

There [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] built the tower of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] on this strategic position, as the guarded Pass connected [[Ard-galen]] and [[West Beleriand]]. It was renamed [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] (Isle of the Werewolves) after its capture by [[Sauron]].<ref>{{S|14}}</ref><ref>{{S|18}}</ref> It was called Wizard's Isle in the [[Lay of Leithian]].<ref>{{LB|3}}, ''passim''</ref>

The loss of Tol Sirion allowed [[Orcs]] to invade West Beleriand and harass [[Talath Dirnen]] and [[Nargothrond]].
