The '''Amon Sûl-stone''' was a ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' that rested in the [[Arnor]]ian [[Weathertop|Tower of Amon Sûl]].  Like the other seeing-stones it was a deep black crystal, spherical, and perfectly smooth.  However, the stones were not all alike and the Amon Sûl-stone, like the [[Osgiliath-stone]], was too large to be lifted by one man.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>

==History==
The Amon Sûl-stone was placed on [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]] by [[Elendil]] when the realm of [[Arnor]] was founded.  After the division of Arnor in {{TA|861}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> both [[Rhudaur]] and [[Cardolan]] contended with [[Arthedain]] for possession of Amon Sûl for they desired the Amon Sûl-stone.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>
 
In {{TA|1409}} the watchtower was burned and destroyed when [[Angmar]]'s forces invaded [[Arnor]], but the Stone was successfully carried back to [[Fornost]].<ref name="TA"/>  [[Arthedain]]'s last King, [[Arvedui]], saved this palantír as well as the [[Annúminas-stone]] when Arthedain was overrun by Angmar in {{TA|1974|n}}. 

With these and other heirlooms, he fled into the far north, where he was given shelter by the [[Lossoth]]. At last a ship from the [[Grey Havens]] came to rescue Arvedui, but after he had boarded, its hull was crushed by the ice, and all aboard were lost. The Stone of Annúminas, along with that of Amon Sûl, were lost in the shipwreck, and sank.<ref name="Eriador"/>
