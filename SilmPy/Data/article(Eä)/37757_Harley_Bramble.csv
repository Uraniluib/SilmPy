'''Harley Bramble''' is a [[Bree-men|man]] of [[Bree]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. People in Bree didn't like Harley Bramble and they didn't treat him good. When Harley did meet a [[Southerners|Southerner]], the southerner used this to stir him up against the other [[Bree-landers]]. If Harley would help the Southerners, he would be running things in Bree at the end. When the two were confronted by [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], Harley did choose to stay on the good side.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>
