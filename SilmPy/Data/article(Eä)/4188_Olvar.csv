'''Olvar''' was [[Yavanna]]'s word for the plants and plant-life in her care. Unlike the ''[[kelvar]]'', they are inanimate. [[Trees]] are the highest of
the olvar.

After her husband [[Aulë]] created the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], she became concerned for the fate of both the [[kelvar]] (animals) and olvar (plants) at the hands of their descendants. She spoke of her fears to [[Manwë]], who revealed that [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] intended that spirits should be sent to dwell among some of the olvar and protect them. This was the ultimate origin of the beings who came to be known as [[Ents]].<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>
==Etymology==
''Olvar'' is [[Quenya]], glossed as "growing things with roots in the earth".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> 

There is a similarity to other relevant words (perhaps variants) such as ''olwa''<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[GÓLOB]]</ref> and ''olba''<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p.340</ref> which are however glossed as "branch".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref>
In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', ''olwa'' is derived from the [[root]] [[GÓLOB]].
