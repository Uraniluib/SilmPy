'''Amlaith''' of [[Fornost]] ({{TA|726}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|946}},<ref name="north">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 220) was the eldest son of [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], the tenth King of [[Arnor]].

==History==
He was destined to become King of [[Arnor]] after his father's death in {{TA|861}}, but there were constant quarrels between [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]]'s sons. A civil war erupted when [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] finally died. Amlaith, however, failed to overcome his two younger brothers, so the Kingdom of Arnor was split into three and Amlaith became the first King of [[Arthedain]]. (His brothers founded the kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]).<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

His reign in Arthedain was largely a peaceful one, although border disputes with the realms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] - especially over [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]] and the [[Weather Hills]] - never fully ceased. Under his rule the capital was formally removed from [[Annúminas]] to Fornost, due to the dwindling of the people.<ref name="Elendil"/>

Unlike his forefathers, he did not take a name in [[Quenya]] the "High Tongue", but instead took a name in [[Sindarin]], as did all of his descendants.<ref>{{App|North}}, note 3</ref>

Amlaith ruled for eighty-five years, and was succeeded at his death in 946 by his son, [[Beleg (King of Arthedain)|Beleg]].<ref name="north"/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Amlaith'' is difficult to translate. The first element is ''[[am]]'', "up, upwards", but the second element is obscure.
