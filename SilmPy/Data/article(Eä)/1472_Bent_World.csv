The '''Bent World''' was a name describing the condition of [[Arda]] after the destruction of [[Númenor]] and the removal of [[Valinor]] in the late [[Second Age]];<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> after this, the world was made 'bent' (or 'round') and only the [[Elves]] could still follow the [[Straight Road]] to the [[Undying Lands]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

In Tolkien's writings as published in the later volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Arda was a round world from its beginning, and the idea of a flat world was instead an invention of the Númenóreans. Thus, in this alternate account, the world would not need to be bent at the time of Númenor's downfall and Aman's removal from the physical world.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>{{fact}}<!--Page ref-->
