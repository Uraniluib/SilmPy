The '''Great Goblin''' was the chief of the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] who dwelt in [[Goblin-town]] beneath the [[High Pass]] in the [[Misty Mountains]], and presumably was the leader of all the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Great Goblin"</ref>  He was described as "tremendous" and had a huge head.<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were captured by the Great Goblin's people after taking refuge in a [[Front Porch|cave]] while crossing the [[Misty Mountains]].  When the [[Dwarves]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] were hauled before the Great Goblin he questioned them regarding their intentions, while accusing them of being spies, thieves, murderers, and friends of [[Elves]].  When one of his guards showed the Great Goblin [[Thorin]]'s sword, [[Orcrist]], he howled with rage and rushed at Thorin with open mouth.  At that moment all of the lights in the cave were extinguished and a flashing sword stabbed the Great Goblin fatally.  The company soon realized that it was [[Gandalf]] who had killed the Great Goblin with his blade [[Glamdring]].<ref name="Hill"/>

==Legacy==
It was the death of the Great Goblin that tickled [[Beorn]]'s fancy enough to gain the Company access to his hall and hospitality.  Once Beorn confirmed their tale he warmed up to true friendship and provided the party with aid, advice, and mounts to ride to the border of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

A further consequence of the Great Goblin's demise was a rekindling of the goblins' hatred towards Dwarves, which led to preparations for war to secure domination of the North.  The goblins assembled at Mount [[Gundabad]] and were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of [[Smaug]].  Altering their plans, the goblins marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], almost immediately after the arrival of [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and participated the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:In the animated version of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'', the Great Goblin was voiced by [[John Stephenson]].


'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:In the console versions, the Great Goblin is mentioned but never seen, since Bilbo is separated from the Dwarves before they meet. However, he's seen in the GBA version, his appearance closely matching his description in the novel. In the latter version, he immediately orders the execution of Thorin and the others after Thorin pleads his case, instead of after the revelation that he has [[Orcrist]] in his possession, before being killed by Gandalf.


'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'']]:'''
:The Great Goblin (referred to as the 'Goblin King') recognises Thorin immediately, and is greatly interested in him because of the bounty put on him by [[Azog]]. He is temporarily incapacitated by Gandalf, when he arrives. He emerges again after a chase, and is killed by Gandalf shortly before their escape from Goblin-town. The character was portrayed by [[Barry Humphries]] through voice acting and motion capture.<ref name="PJCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150286515141558|articlename=The Hobbit Casting Update|dated=19-June-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref>
