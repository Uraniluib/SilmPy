''[[Morifinwë]]'' was the [[father-name]] of [[Caranthir]], the fourth [[Sons of Fëanor|son]] of [[Fëanor]]. It means "Dark Finwë", a reference to his dark hair. The [[Quenya]] word was formed using the noun ''[[more]]'', meaning "blackness" or "dark", which became ''[[mori-]]'' when added to his grandfather's name, ''[[Finwë]]''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod''</ref>
