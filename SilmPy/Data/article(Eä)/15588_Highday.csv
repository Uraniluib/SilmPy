'''Highday''' (archaic form ''Hihdei'') was the seventh and last day of the week in the [[Shire Calendar]]. It represented the [[Númenórean]] day ''[[Orbelain]]'', dedicated to the [[Valar]]. As such it was the chief day of the week and after noon [[Hobbits]] considered it a holiday with evening feasts. <ref name=cal>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

After the reform of [[Isengrim Took II]],<ref name=cal/> dates such as 1 [[Lithe]] and 1 [[Yule]] always fell on Highday. There was no month beginning with Highday, therefore it became a jesting idiom in the [[Shire]] to say "on Friday the first (of [[Summerfilth]])" when referring to a fictitious day or unlikely events.
==Etymology==
''Highday'' represents an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form "Hihdei", a word preserved in the [[Yellowskin]].<ref name=cal/>

''Highday'' is translated as Friday in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', however as it was the chief day of the week, its cultural significance rather corresponded to that of our Sunday. For this reason there was one exception, and in the poem ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'', Highday was translated as "Sunday" instead of Friday.<ref name=cal/><ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
