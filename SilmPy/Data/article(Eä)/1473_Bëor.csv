'''Bëor the Old''' ({{FA|262}} – {{FA|355|n}}, aged 93 years<ref name="Coming">{{WJ|14}}</ref>{{rp|231}}) was the leader of the first [[Men]] to cross the [[Blue Mountains]] into [[Beleriand]] in the First Age. He was originally named '''Balan'''.<ref name="West">{{S|West}}</ref>

==History==
The man once born as Balan (perhaps in [[Eriador]]) was one of the people who sought to reach the [[Valar|Gods]] in the [[Uttermost West|West]]. With his sons [[Belen]] and [[Baran]] and his people, they met [[Dwarves]] and [[Avari]] before eventually crossing the [[Blue Mountains]] in {{FA|310}}.

One night as they slept in [[Ossiriand]], the Noldorin King [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], eldest son of [[Finarfin]], came upon Balan and his people and enchanted them with his music as they woke up. Finrod quickly befriended the Men and advised them to settle in [[Estolad]] in the realm of the Noldorin Elf-lords [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]], the sons of [[Fëanor]].<ref name="West"/> 

In {{FA|311}}, Balan left with Finrod for his kingdom of [[Nargothrond]], where he served as his vassal until his death.<ref name="Coming"/>{{rp|218, 227}} Bëor's eldest son, [[Baran]], ruled the [[House of Bëor|people of Bëor]] in his stead. The friendship of Bëor and Baran with the Eldar led to the creation of the [[House of Bëor|First House]] of the [[Edain]], which produced some of the greatest heroes of the First Age.

Balan was called ''Bëor'' by the [[Nargothrond]]rim, which meant "vassal" in [[Taliska]], the language of the people of Bëor. When Bëor finally died at the age of 93 willingly, a very old age for men at that time, he was given the epithet ''the Old''.<ref name="West"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the introduction to ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that they were written in the 1930s.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p, 3</ref>  This work was laid aside while J.R.R. Tolkien wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', after which he returned to his work on the elder days.  In Tolkien's later writings the coming of the [[Edain]] over the Blue Mountains was relocated nearly a century earlier, which occasioned a large-scale overhaul of the chronology and genealogies.<ref name="Coming" />{{rp|229}}

In the older ''Grey Annals'', Bëor was born in {{FA}} 370<ref>{{GA|121}}</ref>, met Felagund in {{FA|400|n}}<ref>{{GA|124}}</ref>, and died in {{FA|450|n}}.<ref>{{GA|144}}</ref>  In the new version Bëor was born in {{FA|262}}, encountered Felagund in {{FA|310|n}}, and died at age 93 in {{FA|355|n}}.<ref name="Coming" />{{rp|229}}
