'''Ravens''' were large black birds,<ref>{{LB|C2}}, p. 161 (§119)</ref> associated with ill news of death,<ref>{{HM|LB}}, pp. 164-165, 341</ref> and were known for their harsh voices.<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref> 

The intelligent ravens of [[Ravenhill]] near [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], could live to a great age and some could even speak [[Westron]] and were friendly with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]]. [[Carc]] had been one of these, and his son [[Roäc]] was the leader of the ravens of Erebor around {{TA|2941}}, when [[Thorin and Company]] reclaimed the mountain from [[Smaug]].<ref>{{H|15}}</ref>

When [[Peregrin Took]] became one of the [[Guards of the Citadel]], his new garments included a "''high-crowned helm with small raven-wings on either side''".<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
It has been suggested that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s use of ravens is reminiscent of [[Wikipedia:Odin|Odin]]'s two messenger-ravens [[Wikipedia:Huginn and Muminn|Huginn and Muminn]] of the Norse mythology, appearing in the ''[[Edda]]''.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 315</ref> ''See also: [[Roäc#Inspiration|Roäc: Inspiration]]''

In ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', the lord of the ravens is [[Wikipedia:Rerir|Rerir]], grandson of Ódin.<ref>{{HM|SG}}, p. 72</ref> Ravens are further associated with the coming of death.<ref>{{HM|SG}}, pp. 275, 285</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:Ravens, level 4 birds, are enchanted and intelligent, friends of the Free Peoples. They are reputedly the messengers of the Vala [[Mandos]], and are able to speak many Mannish and Elvish tongues.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}, pp. 26, 132</ref>

'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''
:"Ravens of the North" are "''creatures of especially powerful magic''", being able to understand Westron and having extraordinarily long lives.<ref>{{D|Fell}}, p. 58</ref>

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Many ravens are seen returning to the [[Lonely Mountain]] after [[Smaug]] is slain. One is later seen setting out for the [[Iron Hills]], and then returning just as [[Dáin Ironfoot]]'s army arrives. It is possible this raven could be serving the role of [[Roäc]], but it is never confirmed. As with all other birds in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Middle-earth]] films, the ravens do not speak.
