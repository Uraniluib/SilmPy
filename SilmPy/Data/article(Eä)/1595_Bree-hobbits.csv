'''Bree-hobbits''' were the [[Hobbits]] native to [[Bree]] and the [[Bree-land]] around; their interaction with [[Men]] (who also lived in the land), made them more open to the outside world than their parochial [[Shire-hobbits|cousins]] in [[the Shire]]. 
==History==
Bree itself was a very ancient township of [[Men of Bree|Men]]. The first [[Hobbits]] (mostly [[Fallohides]] and [[Harfoots]]) came there from the east in about {{TA|1300}} fleeing [[Angmar]].<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref><ref name=hob>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> This made Bree the only place in the [[Arda|world]] where Hobbits and Men lived together side by side. Most of the Hobbits of the Bree-land lived in [[Staddle]], a village on the southeastern slopes of the [[Bree-hill]], but some also dwelt in Bree itself, living in [[Hobbit-holes]] burrowed in the hill above the houses of Men.

It was where and when the Hobbits (who by that time were speaking a language probably related to that of the [[Éothéod]]<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>) adopted the [[Westron]] tongue; they also learned literacy with the [[Tengwar]], in the fashion of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]].<ref name=hob/> The Hobbits of Bree claimed to have originated most Hobbit customs, and certainly it was thought that they were the ones who first discovered the [[smoking]] properties of [[pipe-weed]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref>

In {{TA|1601}} two Fallohides, [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]], led a group of colonists westward to a province of [[Arnor]], and asking permission from King [[Argeleb II]] they founded [[the Shire]]. The Bree-hobbits, therefore, tended to look down somewhat on their cousins in the Shire, referring to them as 'Colonists' and 'Outsiders'.<ref name=TA/><ref name=hob/>

At the end of the Third Age, the Bree-hobbits still occasionally travelled west to the Shire, but they rarely ventured further than [[Buckland]] or the [[Eastfarthing]], those parts of the Shire that were closest to their home.

During the [[War of the Ring]] two hobbits, [[Bob]] and [[Nob]] worked at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]''. When the [[Travelers]] entered the common room of the inn, they associated with native hobbits and travelers.<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

==Families==
The more prominent Hobbit families living in the Bree-land at the time of the [[War of the Ring]] were [[Banks Family|Banks]], [[Brockhouse Family|Brockhouse]], [[Longholes Family|Longholes]], [[Mugwort Family|Mugwort]], [[Sandheaver Family|Sandheaver]], [[Tunnelly Family|Tunnelly]] and [[Underhill Family|Underhill]]. 

There were also hobbits by the name of Banks living in the Shire, and [[Underhill (village)|Underhill]] was a hamlet of Hobbiton, but we can do no more than speculate on the links between these families and regions.
