The '''dwarf-masks''' were helmets of great crafting made in the [[First Age]] by the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]]. These helmets had face plates which could be lowered over the face as a mask, and through this the fire of dragons might be withstood.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 78</ref>

One such helm was the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]], crafted by the smith [[Telchar]] for the Dwarf King of [[Belegost]], [[Azaghâl]]. This he wore at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] where he fought [[Glaurung]], Father of Dragons.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>  [[Túrin]] [[Mormegil]] was gifted a dwarf-helm during his time in [[Nargothrond]]; and before this was the rightful heir to the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 79</ref>
