The '''Incarnate''' ('''''Mirröanwi''''' in [[Quenya]]<ref>{{MR|Finrod}}, pp. 325, 350</ref>) races were those beings whose natural state is to exist as a union of [[fëa and hröa]]. These races were [[Elves]], [[Men]], and [[Dwarves]].
==Etymology==
''Mirröanwi'', singular ''Mirröanwë'', is a [[Quenya]] word meaning "Incarnates". It is used in reference to the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], who were designed to live as [[Fëa and hröa|embodied souls]].

[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that ''Mirröanwi'' can be analyzed as containing ''[[mi]]'' ("in") and ''hröa'' ("body").<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 34</ref>
