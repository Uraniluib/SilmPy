In an older version of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s conception of the [[Languages]] of [[Middle-earth]] as expounded in the ''[[Lhammas]]'', '''Melkian''' (also known as Orquin or Orquian) is the language which was named after the fallen [[Vala]] [[Melkor]] ([[Morgoth]]). It had its origins from corrupted [[Valarin]]. It was spoken by him and his servants and is the predecessor of many of the dialects of [[Orcs]] and other evil beings.<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>

This concept was later dropped.
