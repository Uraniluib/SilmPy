<blockquote>''"And last of all the mounting wave... took to its bosom Tar-Míriel the Queen, fairer than silver or ivory or pearls."'' — ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Akallabêth]]</blockquote>

'''Tar-Míriel''' was the only child of the late-marrying [[Tar-Palantir]], the twenty-fourth [[King of Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Palantir</ref> By the [[Law of Succession in Númenor|Law of Succession]], established by [[Tar-Aldarion]], she should have become the fourth [[Ruling Queen of Númenor]]. However, after her father's death, Míriel's cousin [[Ar-Pharazôn|Pharazôn]] took her unwillingly as his wife and seized the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] for himself, taking the title of [[Ar-Pharazôn|Ar-Pharazôn the Golden]]. He changed Míriel's name to Ar-Zimraphel.

Ar-Pharazôn in his pride brought a mighty fleet to [[Middle-earth]] to challenge [[Sauron]] for dominion of the land. Sauron pretended to humble himself before the King and was taken as captive to [[Númenor]]. Soon Sauron had fully corrupted the King and had persuaded the aging king to seek immortality and assail [[Valinor]] itself. The [[Valar]] called upon [[the One]], who cast Númenor into the sea. It is said that Tar-Míriel strove to reach the sacred peak of the [[Meneltarma]] before the inundation of the island, but the great wave swept her away from the steep side of the Holy Mountain.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Tar-Míriel, a [[Quenya]] name, had an approximate meaning of "Jewel-daughter". The [[Adûnaic]] name Ar-Pharazôn gave her, Ar-Zimraphel is presumably a translation of this. ''Zimra-'' means, disputably, 'jewel', while ''-phel'' is possibly 'daughter'.

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In one version of the [[Akallabêth]], Míriel was betrothed to [[Elentir]], the brother of [[Amandil]] (the last [[Lord of Andúnië]]). However, she fell desperately in love with Pharazôn and chose to marry him when he took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]]. This story is very different than the tale in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', where Ar-Pharazôn takes Míriel very much against her will in order to claim the Sceptre.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>
