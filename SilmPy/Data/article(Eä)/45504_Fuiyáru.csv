'''Fuiyáru''' was a deadly nightshade that grew about the [[Halls of Mandos|courts of Mandos]]. It is said to have been particularly abundant before the doors of [[Nienna|Fui]].<ref name=PE15>{{PE|15}}, p. 14</ref>

==Etymology==

The name ''Fuiyáro'' is [[Qenya]], likely a literal translation of "nightshade". Its composition probably relates to the elements ''Fui'' (also ''hui'') "fog, dark, murk, night", and ''yaru'' (also ''yara'') "gloom, blight". The [[Gnomish]] name of the flower was '''Fuior'''.<ref name=PE15/>

==Inspiration==

[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has identified the flower as the [[Wikipedia:Atropa belladonna|''Atropa belladonna'']].<ref name=PE15/>
