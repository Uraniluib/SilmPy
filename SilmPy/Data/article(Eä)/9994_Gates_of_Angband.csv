The '''Gates of Angband''' were the entrance to a labyrinthine tunnel system under [[Thangorodrim]] called [[Angband]]. The great wolf [[Carcharoth]] was its guard, and it was before these gates that [[Morgoth]] slew [[Fingolfin]].

{{quote|Ever the sheer cliffs rose beside,<br>where birds of carrion sat and cried;<br>and chasms black and smoking yawned,<br>whence writhing [[Dragons|serpent-shapes]] were spawned;<br>until at last in that huge gloom<br>heavy as overhanging doom,<br>that weighs on [[Thangorodrim]]’s foot<br>like thunder at the mountain’s root,<br>they came, as to a sombre court<br>walled with great towers, fort on fort<br>of cliffs embattled. To that last plain<br>that opens, abysmal and inane,<br>before the final topless wall<br>of [[Bauglir]]’s immeasurable hall,<br>whereunder looming awful waits<br>the gigantic shadow of his gates.|''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', [[Lay of Leithian Canto XI|Canto XI]], lines 3522-3537}}
