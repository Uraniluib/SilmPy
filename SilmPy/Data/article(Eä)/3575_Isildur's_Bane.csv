'''Isildurâ€™s Bane''' was a name for [[the One Ring]].  After [[Sauron]]'s defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], [[Isildur]], [[Elendil]]'s son took the Ring, and later journeyed northward with it to his kingdom of [[Arnor]].  On [[5 October]] {{TA|2}} his small party was ambushed by [[Orcs]].  Isildur's small force was cut down and he fled the battle wearing the Ring. It slipped from his finger, though, and so both Isildur and the Ring were lost.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

On [[20 June]] {{TA|3018|n}}, Sauron attacked [[Osgiliath]].<ref name="TA">{{App|Great}}</ref>  On the eve of this assault a dream came to [[Faramir]], Boromir's brother, that warned of the awakening of Isildur's Bane.  Faramir had the dream often and Boromir had it once.  After consulting with [[Denethor]], Boromir journeyed for one hundred and ten days to seek advice from [[Elrond]].  Finally on [[25 October]]<ref name="TA"/> Boromir received the answers to his questions at the Council of Elrond, where [[Frodo Baggins]] brought out the Ring and Elrond proclaimed, "Behold Isildur's Bane!"<ref name="Council"/>
