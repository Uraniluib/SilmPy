'''Eldest''' was a title for the eldest of all beings. Confusingly, it seems to apply to two different individuals; not only does [[Tom Bombadil]] claim it for himself,<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref> but [[Celeborn]] also uses it to address the old [[Ents|Ent]] [[Treebeard]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> Tom Bombadil's nature, including what manner of being he is and if he can be considered alive and [[incarnate]], remains unknown. The matter of who is truly the eldest living being in [[Middle-earth]] is a mystery.
