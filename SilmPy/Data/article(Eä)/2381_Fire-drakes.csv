'''Fire-drakes''' ([[Quenya]] ''[[Urulókë|Urulóki]]'') were fire breathing [[Dragons]].
==History and Characteristics==
The fire-drakes were the more powerful of the two fundamental divisions of dragon-kind (the other being the [[cold-drakes]]), who, as the name suggests, were able to breathe fire. [[Glaurung]], the [[Father of Dragons]], was the first of the species.<ref name=Return/> He first appeared in the middle of the [[First Age]] but the Urulóki were known to have survived even after the downfall of [[Morgoth]]. Other dragons considered to be of the fire-drakes during the [[Elder Days]] were [[Ancalagon|Ancalagon the Black]] and the terrible [[Beast of Gondolin]].

[[Smaug]], the last of the truly powerful dragons, was slain by [[Bard]] in the late [[Third Age]].<ref>{{HM|H}}, ''passim''</ref> We can be sure that he was not the last of the fire-drakes, though, because [[Gandalf]] refers to fire-breathing dragons in the time before the [[War of the Ring]], nearly eighty years after Smaug's death.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>
