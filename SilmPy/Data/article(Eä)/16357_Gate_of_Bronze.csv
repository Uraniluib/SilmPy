The '''Gate of Bronze''' was the third of the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin]], in shape a wall spanning the [[Orfalch Echor]] mounted by three square towers, roofed and "clad" in bright copper.  The double-door hung with shields and bronze plates, wrought with many figures and strange signs.  There were many red lamps along the wall, which made the copper and bronze shine like fire.  The guards of this gate wore red mail, and carried red-bladed axes.  These guards were mostly [[Sindar]] of [[Nevrast]].  The gate followed the [[Gate of Stone]] and was followed by the [[Gate of Writhen Iron]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
