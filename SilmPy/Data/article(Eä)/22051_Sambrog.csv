'''Sambrog''' is a character created specifically for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. He is the Wight-lord of [[Othrongroth]] and was summoned by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. It is unknown if he created him or just called for his presence. The Witch-king summoned him to slay some [[Free peoples]] who overheard of their plans. Yet, [[Tom Bombadil]] sang a song which vanished the [[Barrow-wights|wight]] before he could do so.<ref>{{VGC|SAI}} Chapter 11: "Othrongroth"</ref>
