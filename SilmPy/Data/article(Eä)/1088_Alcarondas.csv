'''Alcarondas''' or '''Aglarrâma''', the Castle of the Sea was the golden-and-black flagship of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], the last King of [[Númenor]].  It had many oars and many masts, upon which were sails of gold and sable.  

In this ship, he sailed to the shores of [[Aman]], leading the [[Great Armament]] to challenge the [[Valar]]. Alcarondas indeed reached the Undying Lands and anchored at shores of the Undying Lands and Ar-Pharazôn reached [[Tirion]], but this act only condemned him, his fleet and his kingdom.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''"Aglarrâma"''' appears in earlier text and is [[Adûnaic]] which seems to incorporate the [[Sindarin]] word for "glory", [[aglar]], perhaps adapted in Adûnaic.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p.156</ref> [[Andreas Moehn]] suggests that the second element ''-râma'' is an adaptation of Quenya ''ráma/ráme'' "wing", (seen also in the ship-name ''[[Eärrámë]]''<ref>{{UT|Erendis}}</ref>) and thus probably means "Sails of Glory". The meaning "Man of Glory" is also considered, based on the etymology of other [[Mannish]] words.<ref name=Atani/>

'''"Alcarondas"''' in form is obviously [[Quenya]], which is curious, considering the royal spite for Elvish. It is said that "Castle of the Sea" is its translation, however it doesn't contain any recognizable elements for "castle" or "sea" (which in [[Quenya]] is [[eär]]).<ref name=Atani>{{webcite|website=Lalaith|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html|articlename=Etymologies of the Atani languages|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]}}, entry RAM</ref> 

The only definitely recognizeable Quenya element is ''[[alcar]]'' "glory" (cf. '''''Aglar'''râma'' above). [[Andreas Moehn]] suggests that it means "Dome of Glory",<ref name=Atani/> obviously containing a form of Quenya ''rondo'' "vaulted hall"<ref>Cf. {{VT|39a}}, p.9 and {{VT|46a}}, p.12</ref>
