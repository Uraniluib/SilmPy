'''Atarinya''' is an [[Elvish]] term meaning 'my father'. It is recorded twice in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s work, used once by [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]] to his father [[Isildur]],<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> and also long before by [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] to his father [[Meneldur]] in [[NÃºmenor]].<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref> In both cases, the opposite form would be [[onya]], 'my son'. The same word-ending could be used to create affectionate forms from personal names: for example, [[Meneldur]] also called [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] [[Anardilya]] ('my Anardil' - with Anardil being [[Tar-Aldarion]]'s original name).<ref name="Wife"/>
