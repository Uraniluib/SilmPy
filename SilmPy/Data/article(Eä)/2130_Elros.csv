== History ==
[[File:Catherine Karina Chmiel - And Maglor took pity upon them.jpg|thumb|left|''And Maglor took pity upon them'' by Catherine Karina Chmiel]]
Elros and Elrond were born in the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] during the darkest days of the First Age, when the forces of [[Morgoth]] controlled most of [[Beleriand]]. When the twins were just six years old, the [[Sons of Fëanor]], bound by their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], assaulted the Havens in the [[Third Kinslaying]] since they desired the [[Silmaril]] on the [[Nauglamir]] held by Eärendil. He was at sea, and Elwing barely escaped with the Nauglamir. 

[[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], the only Sons of Fëanor to repudiate their deeds, spared the twin boys and raised them for a time.  They were later found by other elves as the twins were playing by a forest waterfall under the starlight; these gave him the name Elros meaning "star-foam" (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]) and protected them through the end of the First Age.<ref name="Earendil"/>.

After the [[War of Wrath]] and the destruction of Beleriand, the Valar gave the twin ''[[Peredhil]]'' the choice over their race and fate. Elros chose the [[Gift of Men]],<ref name="Earendil"/> but still, he was blessed with a life longer than any other mortal Man's.

In the first years of the [[Second Age]], the Valar had prepared for the Edain, as a reward for their struggle against Morgoth, a large island in the western part of the [[Great Sea]]. Now by right a lord of the [[Edain]]<ref group=note>His father, Eärendil, was a descendant of the Lords of all Three Houses</ref>, Elros led his people across the sea, guided by the [[Star of Eärendil]] his father, to the island. For this the island was called [[Elenna]] meaning "starwards", and was the closest of mortal lands to the [[Blessed Realm]], though Men were [[Ban of the Valar|forbidden to go]] any further west than Elenna. The Valar also gave the Edain substantially longer lifespans than most Men had, and Elros and his descendants had the longest lives of all the people.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Elros founded the realm of [[Númenor]] and became its first [[King of Númenor|King]] in the year 32 of the Second Age. He took a royal name in [[Quenya]], ''Tar-Minyatur'', thus setting a tradition of Quenya being the royal language of the isle, even though the common tongue was [[Adûnaic]].<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}</ref> He brought with him the [[Ring of Barahir]], the [[Dramborleg|Axe of Tuor]], the [[Bow of Bregor|Bow]] of [[Bregor]] and [[Thingol]]'s sword [[Aranrúth]] as family heirlooms.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref>

He built the royal tower at [[Armenelos]] and throughout his reign the kingdom received gifts from the Elves of [[Tol Eressëa]], including flowers from the gardens of [[Yavanna]] and a seed from [[Celeborn, White Tree|Celeborn]]. This was the beginning of the [[Númenóreans]]' long friendship with the Elves of the West, a relationship that would define the future of Númenor.

Tar-Minyatur had four children: three sons, [[Vardamir|Vardamir Nólimon]], [[Manwendil]], and [[Atanalcar]]; and one daughter, [[Tindómiel]].<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref><ref group="note">Elros' children [[Tindómiel]], [[Manwendil]] and [[Atanalcar]] are referred to by name only in the family tree "The Earlier Generations of the Line of Elros", which is included in only some editions of ''Unfinished Tales''.</ref> After living five centuries, and ruling Númenor for 410 years, Tar-Minyatur died and his son Vardamir Nólimon took up the [[Sceptre]] of Númenor as [[Vardamir|Tar-Vardamir]]. But because Elros had lived so long, Tar-Vardamir was already old, and was thus only a titular King: he immediately surrendered the Sceptre to his son, [[Tar-Amandil]].<ref name="Kings"/>

== Etymology ==
''Elros'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "Elf of the spray", based on a tale from his early childhood when the [[Sons of Fëanor]] abducted the twins until [[Maedhros]] found them playing in a forest waterfall.  Alternatively, his name could mean "star-foam".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> The Sindarin elements are ''[[el]]'' ("star") and ''[[ros]]'' ("foam").<ref name=Elements>{{S|Elements}}</ref>

''Elros'' is the [[Sindarin]] form of [[Quenya]] '''''Elerossë''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌeleˈrosːe]}}).<ref name=Elements/>

==Other names and titles==

Elros' royal name, '''''Tar-Minyatur''''', is [[Quenya]] for "High First-Lord", consisting of ''[[tar]]'' ("high") + ''[[minya]]'' ("first") + ''[[tur]]'' ("master, lord").{{fact}} All the Kings and [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queens]] after Elros who took their names in Quenya also used the prefix ''tar-'' in their royal names.

In early versions of the [[legendarium]], Elros' [[Adûnaic]] name was ''Indilzar'',<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p.164</ref> which was changed to ''Gimilzôr''. However, in later versions of the Númenórean tale ''[[Ar-Gimilzôr|(Ar-)Gimilzôr]]'' was the name of the twenty-third King of Númenor.<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}, pp. 380-1 (§20)</ref>

== Genealogy ==
Though he is known as '[[Half-elven]]', Elros's lineage is much more complicated than that title suggests. He could claim descent from all the main branches of the [[Eldar]], each of the [[Three Houses of the Edain]], and even from the [[Maiar]]. To be completely correct, he was slightly more than ''half''-elven: actually, nine-sixteenths of his ancestors were [[Elves]]. A full breakdown of his descent works out like this:
* Three eighths [[Edain]], through two lines: his grandfather [[Tuor]] of the [[House of Hador]], and his great-grandfather [[Beren]] of the [[House of Bëor]]. He was also descended from the third House of the Edain, the [[Haladin]], through [[Tuor|Tuor's]] grandmother [[Hareth]].
*Five sixteenths [[Sindar]], again through two lines: his grandmother [[Nimloth]] and his great-great-grandfather [[Thingol]].
*Five thirty-seconds [[Vanyar]], through his great-grandmother [[Elenwë]], and also through his great-great-great-grandmother, [[Indis]] the second wife of [[Finwë]].
*Three thirty-seconds [[Noldor]], through his great-grandfather, [[Turgon]] (who himself had only three-quarters Noldorin blood).
*One sixteenth [[Maiar]], through his great-great-grandmother [[Melian]].
