}}'''Elladan''' and his [[twins|twin]] brother [[Elrohir]] were the children of [[Celebrían]] and [[Elrond]]. The first of the twins, Elladan ("Elf-Man") was named so as a token of their ancestry; they were descended not only from the noble Houses of the [[Edain]] through their father, but also from royal houses of the [[Eldar]] through their mother.

==Description==
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] their elven-fair faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the [[Grey Company]] they wore cloaks of silver-grey over a bright mail.<ref name="Passing"/>

==History==
In the year {{TA|2509}}, the twins' mother Celebrían went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, [[Galadriel]], in the land of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]. In the [[Redhorn Pass]], she was captured by orcs, and tortured in their dens. Elladan rode with his brother to rescue her, but by the time they reached her she had received a poisonous wound.<ref name="TA"/> Though their father healed her, she would not remain in [[Middle-earth]], and sailed into the [[Aman|West]] the following year. After this loss, Elladan and Elrohir were filled with hatred of the [[orcs]], often riding against them with the [[Northern Dúnedain]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> In {{TA|2933|n}} they saw [[Arathorn II]] killed by orcs while hunting with him.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

In the early part of the [[War of the Ring]], the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]]; around [[November]] {{TA|3018}} they were sent by [[Elrond]] on a secret errand, passed down the [[Silverlode]] into a "[[Lothlorien|strange country]]" and were the last to return to [[Rivendell]], in [[December]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

Later they took a more active part. When [[Halbarad]] rode to [[Aragorn|Aragorn's]] aid with the [[Grey Company]], Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them.<ref name="Passing"/> They followed Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]], fought with him at [[Pelargir]], and took part in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where they fought with stars bound to their brows.

After the [[War of the Ring]], little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at [[Rivendell]], and remained there even after he had passed across the Sea.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref> Like their sister [[Arwen]], the sons of Elrond [[Half-elven]] were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the [[Undying Lands]], or remain there and become [[Mortals|mortal]] as [[men]]. So they chose, for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown.
