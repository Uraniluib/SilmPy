'''Andreth''' was a wisewoman from the [[House of Bëor]]. She was called ''Saelind'' by the [[Elves]], for she was wise in thought and learned in the lore of [[Men]].<ref name=MR>{{MR|P4}}</ref>

==History==
Andreth was the elder daughter and second child of [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)|Boromir]] and a sister to [[Bregor]] and [[Beril]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref>

In her youth, she dwelt in the house of her uncle, [[Belemir]], where she had learned the lore of the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]] from his wife, the [[Wisewoman]] [[Adanel]].  

Andreth was deeply in love with the Noldorin Elf-lord [[Aegnor]], the son of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] and the brother of [[Finrod]], [[Angrod]], and [[Galadriel]]. During the [[Siege of Angband]] the [[Noldor|Elf]]-lord saw young Andreth in the reflection of [[Aeluin]] and they fell in love with each other. However, he could not reciprocate her love since, according to the law of the Eldar, no marriages could happen during times of war. It is said that for her sake, he would not take any Elven bride. Both remained unwed and childless. 

She grew in knowledge and understanding of lore and as she grew older she was respected as a wisewoman after Adanel.

She had a close friendship with Aegnor's eldest brother, King Finrod of [[Nargothrond]], who often visited her during the Siege to converse with her wisdom on the matters of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. One such conversation was written down and later known as ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.<ref name=MR/>
