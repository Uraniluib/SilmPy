The '''Last Bridge''' was an ancient stone bridge<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> that carried the [[East Road]] over the River [[Hoarwell]] (''Mitheithel''), about a hundred miles east of [[Weathertop]] and roughly the same distance west of [[Rivendell]].<ref name="UTmap">{{UT|Map}}</ref> Its three arches<ref name="Flight">{{FR|I12}}</ref> crossed the rushing river at the bottom of a deep valley<ref name="Mutton"/> and to the east the land rose again into the wooded hills of the [[Trollshaws]].<ref name="UTmap"/> It was the only practicable crossing point south of the river's sources in the [[Ettenmoors]].<ref name="Flight"/>

==History==
How ancient the bridge was is unknown. It may have been as old as the East-West Road, which possibly dated to the [[First Age]],<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}, notes 3 and 4</ref> or it may have been built or improved by the [[Númenóreans]].<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Roads'', (2) East of the Blue Mountains</ref> In the [[Third Age]] the bridge was within the bounds of the realm of [[Arnor]] and then [[Rhudaur]],<ref name="UTmap"/> and probably these two realms kept up the maintenance of this strategic structure.

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] passed over the bridge on their way to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. After the crossing the one of the ponies bolted back into the river and its load of food was lost. This loss of provisions and the dwarves' inability to ignite a fire in the wind and rain led to the encounter of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his companions with the unfriendly trio of trolls.<ref name="Mutton"/>

On [[11 October]] {{TA|3018}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> three [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] were guarding the bridge against [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on their journey to Rivendell. Their plan was foiled by [[Glorfindel]], who drove them away<ref name="Flight"/> and left his token, a green beryl, on the Bridge. Two days later<ref name="Great"/> Aragorn found the beryl, took it as a sign that the bridge was safe, and led the hobbits over it.<ref name="Flight"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the 1960 abandoned rewrite of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Last Bridge was more prominent in the story. When the Company came to the bridge they found its single arch broken ([[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had forgotten in this draft that the bridge had three arches in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' - see above). The company had to cross the dangerous ford instead. [[Gandalf]] (not yet vanished as in the published story) tried the crossing first on his horse [[Rohald]]. His success led to the dwarves crossing, followed by Bilbo, although one of the pack-ponies still bolted back into the river.<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, pp. 795-796</ref>

The 1960 rewrite ended in the next chapter just as the Company came to the edge of the valley of [[Rivendell]]. In a note regarding contents yet to write it was stated "Ch. III should make clear [[Elrond]]'s care for roads etc. from Greyflood to <Mountains>".<ref>{{HH|NC3}}, p. 803</ref> This would explain how the Last Bridge got fixed before [[Frodo Baggins]] arrived and found the structure intact.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' video game]]''':
:While the Last Bridge is absent from the home console and PC versions, it is featured in the GBA version. In addition to the bridge itself, there is also a small, populated village built on the western end. It is here that Frodo's Morgul-wound is treated by a local healer instead of by Elrond in Rivendell.
