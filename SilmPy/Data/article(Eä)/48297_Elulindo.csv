'''Elulindo''' was a son of [[Elwë]], Lord of the [[Teleri]], in a genealogical table created by [[Tolkien]] probably in the early 1930s. The table has not been published but [[Christopher Tolkien]] mentioned the name in his comments on the genealogies of "The Quenta" period in the Appendix of ''The Lost Road''.<ref>{{LR|A1}}, 403</ref>

In the later versions of [[The Silmarillion]] the name of the father of Elulindo was changed from Elwë to [[Olwë]]. Olwë is told to have had many sons but none of them is known by name, nor their deeds have been recorded.<ref>{{S|5}}.</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is composed of [[Elu]] and [[lindo]] 'singer', probably conceived as [[Telerin]] words at the time.
