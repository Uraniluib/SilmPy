'''Meássë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] only appearing in the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]]. She is described as the "warrior [[Gods|goddess]]" and an "[[Wikipedia:Amazons|Amazon]] with bloody arms". She was the "fierce sister" of [[Makar]].

== History ==
Meássë was among the [[Ainur]] who aligned themselves with [[Melko]] during the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref>

Upon their arrival to [[Valinor]] she and her brother Makar, made an abode in the northern [[Aman]] close to the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name="Valar">{{LT1|III}}, p. 79</ref>
She, along with her brother, rode often to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], where they hunted wolves and bears in the black mountains.<ref name="Valar">{{LT1|III}}, p. 79</ref>

When the [[Elves]] awoke, she backed Makar in his opposition to the rest of the Valar, saying that Valinor was built for the Valar only.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 125</ref>

She joined her brother and the rest of the Valar in the pursuit of Melko and his servants who were escaping from Valinor, after the destruction of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 171</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Meássë'' is a [[Qenya]] name, deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] MEHE ("ooze?") and related to the word ''mear'' ("gore"). One of her other names was '''''Rávi''''' (related to ''ravennë'' "she-[[lions|lion]]").<ref name="Ravi">{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 299</ref>
