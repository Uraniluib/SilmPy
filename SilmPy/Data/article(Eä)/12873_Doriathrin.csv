'''Doriathrin''' or the language of [[Doriath]], was a form of [[Sindarin]] used during the [[First Age]] which preserved many archaic forms.

One difference from Sindarin was the plural form.  Unlike Sindarin, the plural suffix is ''[[-in]]'', as in ''orthin'' the plural of ''[[orth]]'').

The state of Doriathrin, as a language or dialect, relating to Sindarin proper is not fully known. In the annals the names [[Dolmed]], [[Menegroth]], [[Mablung]], [[Nauglamîr]], [[Dagnir Glaurunga]], [[Thingol]], [[Thuringwethil]] and [[Dior]] refer to names of the speech of Doriath. On the contrary, [[Daeron]] is proper Sindarin form of the Doriathrin name ''[[Dairon]]''.

Doriathrin seems not to have been derived from [[Old Sindarin]]. For example OS *''botto'' (from [[PQ]] *''mbottô'') brings proper Sindarin ''[[both]]''; but the same word in Doriathrin is ''[[moth]]'' so it can't be derived from *''botto'' but from an older form where the ''m'' of *''mbottô'' was retained.

Another difference from Old Sindarin and Sindarin was that in general, Doriathrin had preferred short monosyllabic words where their Sindarin cognates had two syllables. Doriathrin tended to drop the second vowel. For example:
*[[Eledh]] - [[Eld]]
*[[doron]] - [[dorn]]
*[[gorth#Other versions|goroth]] - [[gorth]]
*[[garaf]] - [[garm]]
*[[Golodh]] - [[Gold]]
*[[ered|orod]] - [[orth]]
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Doriathrin is known only as a vocabulary from ''[[The Etymologies]]''. Since the backstory of the ''Etymologies'' was different from the published Silmarillion, Doriathrin appears different from the [[Old Noldorin]] (read [[Old Sindarin]]); according to the later backstory, Sindarin and Doriathrin were brought into far closer contact than before because Old Sindarin (or a similar language) could have been the common ancestor of all the languages of [[Beleriand]]. Debate has arisen whether the Doriathrin vocabulary became obsolete in the continuity of the later legendarium, and the words that "survived" were merged to proper Sindarin.<ref name="Arda">[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf Ardalambion], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/doriath.htm Doriathrin - ''the mothertongue of Lúthien'']" (accessed 15 July 2011)</ref><ref name="Elfling">[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling Elfling], "[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/551 Doriathrin]"</ref>
