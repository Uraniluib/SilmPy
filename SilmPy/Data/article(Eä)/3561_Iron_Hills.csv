The '''Iron Hills''' were a range of great hills in the north-east of [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. The Hills were the source of the river [[Carnen]] and rich in iron.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref><ref name="Third">{{PM|Third}}</ref> It was also home to a [[Dwarf realms|Dwarf-realm]] of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]].<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

The Iron Hills were rich in iron,<ref name=Relations>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 302</ref> but probably not in [[gold]]; the [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]], although prosperous, were not as wealthy as their other cousins.<ref name=Foster/>

==History==
===Early history===
The [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] colonized the Iron Hills in the [[First Age]].<ref group=note>The existence of the Iron Hills in the First Age is confirmed by Tolkien's writings published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''. Before these writings were published, other authors speculated that the Iron Hills might have been a part of the [[Iron Mountains]] in the First Age and came into independent existence after the [[War of Wrath]]. See [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' p. 78 and [[Charles Noad]], "A Note on the Geography of the [[First Age]]" in [[Amon Hen 38|''Amon Hen'' 38]], p. 12.</ref> The Hills were their primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=Relations/> The [[Old Forest Road|Dwarf-road of Mirkwood]] ran north-east to the Hills for the dwarf-traders and merchants between Khazad-dûm and the Hills.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, p. 323 (note 30)</ref>

Also in the First Age, some Men who migrated out of the east—"laggard kindred" of the [[Edain]]—chose to settle in the lands between the Iron Hills and Mirkwood.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}, p. 306</ref>

After [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]] in the [[Second Age]], the Longbeards sealed Khazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the Grey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and Khazad-dûm for some time.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref>

===Third Age===
In {{TA|1981}} the last of the Dwarves living in Khazad-dûm fled from the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] who had slain kings [[Durin VI]] and [[Náin I]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Some of those who escaped wandered as far as the Iron Hills and resettled there.<ref name="Third"/>

In {{TA|2570|n}} dragons began [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|afflicting the dwarves in the north]] and in {{TA|2589|n}} King [[Dáin I]] was slain by a [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] outside [[Dáin's halls|his halls]] in the [[Grey Mountains]].<ref name="TA"/> Due to these depredations, in {{TA|2590|n}} [[Grór]] son of Dáin left the Grey Mountains and established a Lordship in the Iron Hills.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Over the next few centuries Grór and his people built the hills from a just an ancient mining colony to a great realm, especially after the [[Sack of Erebor|destruction]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in {{TA|2770|n}}<ref name="TA"/> when the Dragon [[Smaug]] scattered the Longbeards who dwelt there. Most of the survivors subsequently went to their kinsmen in the Iron Hills, swelling its numbers.

Before the death of [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2941}},<ref name="TA"/> the dwarven realm in the Iron Hills was the only force in the north-east of [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] capable of offering a large and strong enough resistance to the forces of evil.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

In {{TA|2799|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the final battle of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] [[Battle of Azanulbizar|occurred in the Dimrill Dale]]. When reinforcements, led by [[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]], arrived from the Iron Hills the battle turned in the favour of the dwarves. With the war over, Dáin led his people home where, after the death of Grór, he became the new [[Lord of the Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941|n}} Lord [[Dáin Ironfoot]] led his warriors in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] near Erebor. The battle was won, but Thorin was slain and Dáin became the new [[King under the Mountain]] and [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of the Longbeards]] as Dáin II.<ref name="TA"/><ref name="Durin"/> He relocated to Erebor with many of his people, and re-established it as Durin's folk's greatest and strongest dwelling in the north. The Iron Hills pass out of history after this relocation, but probably were not wholly deserted.<ref name=Foster>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 212</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Iron Hills are an area in the region of "The Dwarf-holds". Settled by "Farin Blackmattock" in the First Age, the capital Járnfast was destroyed by the fall of [[Thangorodrim]] and afterwards rebuilt. During the time it features in the game, the town has been damaged by tremors caused by [[Mount Doom]]'s recent eruption. It is also the site of a seal that confines a horde of [[Nameless Things|Nameless creatures]] in "The Howling Pit" below.
