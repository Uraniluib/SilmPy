'''Khand''' was the name of a land which lay to the south-east of [[Mordor]] and to the east of [[Near Harad]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> The [[Men]] of Khand included the [[Variags]].<ref name="Pelennor">{{RK|V6}}</ref>

==History==
Little is known about Khand or its people, other than that they were allied to Mordor. 

The people of Khand and of [[Rhûn]] seemed to have been enemies on and off throughout the ages, but the [[Easterlings]] known as [[Wainriders]] passed south of Mordor and gathered with them Men of Khand and [[Haradrim]] of [[Near Harad]]; in {{TA|1944}} they made a coordinated attack against [[Gondor]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

Years later, Variags from Khand joined the forces of [[Sauron]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Pelennor"/>

It is unknown if Khand was ever conquered by the [[Reunited Kingdom]] or if they remained independent. It is also unknown if Khand ever warred with the folk of the West after [[Sauron]]'s demise.

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Khand'' is unknown; it is, along with ''[[mûmak]]'' and ''[[Variag]]'', one of the few known words from the languages of the Men of the East and allies of Sauron.<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 79.</ref>
