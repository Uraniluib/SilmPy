'''Indis''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈindis]}}) was a [[Vanyar|Vanya]], the second wife of [[Finwë]].  
==History==
In earlier versions, Indis was the close kin, likely sister,<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}</ref> of [[Ingwë]], King of the [[Vanyar]] and [[High King of the Elves]].<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

After the death of [[Míriel Serindë]], Finwë was allowed by [[Manwë]] to take a second wife and Indis thus became the stepmother to [[Fëanor]]. With Indis, Finwë had two more sons, [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]], and two daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]]. Fëanor observed the influence of Indis on Finwë, including his speech which started to resemble [[Vanyarin|that of the Vanyar]] and considered it a disrespect against his mother.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>

After the slaying of her husband, she, along with her eldest daughter Findis, returned to [[Valinor]] to live among her people, the [[Vanyar]].
