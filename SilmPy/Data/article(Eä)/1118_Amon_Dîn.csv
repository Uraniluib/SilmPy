{{disambig-two|a [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] of [[Gondor]]|magazine|[[Amon Dîn (magazine)]]}}
'''Amon Dîn''', sometimes just '''Dîn''', was the easternmost of the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon hills]] of [[Gondor]] and nearest to [[Minas Tirith]], lying to the east of the [[Drúadan Forest]].<ref name=UT>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 510</ref>

Amon Dîn was perhaps the oldest of the beacon hills, originally used as a fortified outpost of Minas Tirith. It kept watch over the passage into North [[Ithilien]] from [[Dagorlad]] and any attempt by enemies to cross the [[Anduin]] near [[Cair Andros]].<ref name=UT/><ref name=RC/>

In the late [[Third Age]], the eastward side of Amon Dîn was covered with wide grey thickets.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>  On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Amon Dîn'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "silent hill" (''[[amon]]'' + ''[[dîn]]'').<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 19</ref><ref name=RC/> Probably it refers to its distinct rocky and barren appearance standing out and isolated from the heavily wooded hills of the Drúadan Forest.
