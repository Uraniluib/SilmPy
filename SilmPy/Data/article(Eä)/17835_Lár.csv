'''''lár''''' means "a stop or pause" in [[Quenya]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 9</ref>

The word also referred to a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] linear measure roughly equivalent to, and translated in the text as, a league.  Whereas our "league" is 5280 yards (4828 metres), the ''lár'' is 5277 yards, 2 feet and 4 inches (4825 metres), or 5000 ''[[Ranga|rangar]]''.  It was called "pause" because Númenórean military units on the march usually paused every 5000 ''rangar''.<ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>
