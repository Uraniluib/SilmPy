'''Losgar''' was a place at the mouth of the Firth of [[Drengist]], in [[Lammoth]], the cold lands north-west of [[Beleriand]]. 

It was here that [[Fëanor]] landed during the [[Long Night]] with the stolen [[swan-ships]] of the [[Falmari]], and gave the order to burn them, because he considered the host of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finrod]] to be "needless baggage on the road", saying: "Let those that cursed my name, curse me still, and whine their way back to the cages of the Valar". In the event, the Noldor left behind chose instead to march across the deadly [[Helcaraxë]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> 

According to a legend, another reason to burn the ships at Losgar was to prevent some Noldor from turning back, such as his own son [[Amrod]], who was uncomfortable with his father's deeds. According to this legend, Amrod died as he was still sleeping inside the first ship burned.<ref>{{PM|XI7}}</ref>
