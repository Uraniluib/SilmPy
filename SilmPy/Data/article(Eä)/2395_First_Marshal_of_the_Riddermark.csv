The '''First Marshal of the Riddermark''' was the highest military rank among the [[Éored|Riders of Rohan]]. Unlike the [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second]] and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshals]], whose duties were assigned as the times demanded, the First Marshal always had the same responsibility: he commanded the [[Muster of Edoras]], i.e. the Riders of the capital [[Edoras]] and the [[Folde|surrounding lands]], including the King's Lands and [[Harrowdale]]. 

In his youth, King [[Théoden]] had led the Riders of the Muster of Edoras himself, so that no First Marshal was needed. When the King later fell under [[Saruman]]'s power, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] worked to ensure that no First Marshal was appointed, leaving a vacuum of power for him to exploit, and at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], there was no First Marshal of the Riddermark.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>
