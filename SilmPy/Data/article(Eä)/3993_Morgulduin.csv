The '''Morgulduin''' was a river of [[Gondor]] that began in [[Morgul Vale]] in the [[Ephel DÃºath]].  It ran westward past [[Minas Morgul]] until it reached the [[Cross-roads]] in [[Ithilien]], where its course turned southwest until it entered the [[Anduin]] just south of [[Osgiliath]].  Just to the north of the stream was the road from Osgiliath up to [[Minas Morgul]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

As [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] were approaching the Crossroads they heard the voice of the river, which sounded cold and cruel.<ref>{{TT|IV7}}</ref>  The river was polluted - near Minas Morgul a cold steam issued from the river whose stench and vapours sickened the hobbits.<ref>{{TT|IV8}}</ref>
==Etymoloy==

It has been suggested that ''Morgulduin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "black magic river" (consisting of ''[[morgul]]'' + ''[[duin]]'').<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com]|accessed=3 January 2012}}</ref>
