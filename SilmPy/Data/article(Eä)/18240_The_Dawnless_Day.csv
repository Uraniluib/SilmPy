'''The Dawnless Day''' refers to [[10 March]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> when fumes from [[Mordor]] veiled the [[Sun]] in an attempt by [[Sauron]] to discourage or misguide his enemies.  The veil of [[The Darkness|Darkness]] blacked out most of [[Gondor]]<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> and [[Rohan]],<ref name="Muster">{{RK|V5}}</ref> though some beams of light could pass through it. 

Along with the Darkness, a host from [[Minas Morgul]] set forth toward [[Minas Tirith]], as witnessed by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] who passed the [[Cross-roads]].<ref>{{TT|IV7}}</ref> Later [[Orcs]] from the [[Morannon]] took [[Cair Andros]] and passed into [[Anórien]].<ref name="Great"/> 

The Darkness was also observed by the [[Rohirrim]] who were mustering their Riders and rode from [[Harrowdale]].<ref name="Muster"/>

On this day [[Faramir]] was rescued by [[Gandalf]] and [[Imrahil]] outside the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]] and [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] led the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]] and the [[Grey Company]], across the river [[Ringló]].<ref name="Great"/>

The Darkness was eventually driven away by a Western wind (perhaps sent from [[Manwë]]) on the afternoon of [[15 March|March 15]], when [[Aragorn]] and his companions came to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
