'''Mount Dolmed''' was a mountain in the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]].

==History==
Mount Dolmed loomed over the only known pass from [[Eriador]] into [[Beleriand]]. It was here that according to the [[Dwarves]] two of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], the founders of the [[Broadbeams]] and the [[Firebeards]], awoke. Their descendants later established the Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]].

The two cities were established on the Eastern side of the mountain.  Just a little of North-east of Dolmed was Belegost, and a little to the South-east was Nogrod.

In {{YT|1497}}, the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] was fought between the [[Elves]], and the forces of [[Morgoth]].  In the end the Elves had the victory and the surviving [[Orcs]] fled east toward the Ered Luin.  They were however met by the Dwarves and annihilated by them.    

Almost five hundred years later, a short [[War of the Elves and Dwarves|war]] occurred between the [[Elves of Doriath]] and the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]]. In {{FA|503}}, after returning from their victory in [[Menegroth]], the Dwarves were [[Battle of Sarn Athrad|ambushed]] at [[Sarn Athrad]] and slaughtered. The survivors were climbing the slopes of Mount Dolmed when they were waylaid and annihilated by [[Ents]].

==Fate==
[[File:Didier Willis - Mount Dolmed and Amon Ereb.png|thumb|Collage of maps showing a mountain peak slightly apart the main range of the [[Blue Mountains]] and apparently coinciding with Mount Dolmed's location.]]
Some [[Tolkienists]] such as [[Robert Foster]] and [[Karen Fonstad]] speculate that after the [[War of Wrath]] Dolmed was destroyed when the Ered Luin were broken and the [[Gulf of Lune]], broke through it.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', page 89</ref><ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 37</ref>

However, [[Ronald Kyrmse|Ronald E. Kyrmse]]<ref>[[Ronald Kyrmse]], "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in ''[[Mallorn_(journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn_26|26]], September 1989, pp. 25–27</ref> and later [[Didier Willis]]<ref>[[Didier Willis]], Bulletin de géographie ''Hiswelóce'', special issue no. 1, Winter 1994 (French); [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Mystères géographiques n°1 : Mont Dolmed & cités naines] (c. 2000), [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/index.php?lng=fr Hiwelokë], accessed March 23rd, 2011 (French); revised and augmented in "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'', vol. 2, 2014, pp. 197-230.</ref> independently noted a prominent unidentified mountain exactly on the location of Dolmed in the map of Beleriand as well as Mount [[Rerir]] to the north.  This, coupled with a reinterpretation of Tolkien's maps, shows that Dolmed at least partially survived the devastation.

==Etymology==
The name means "wet head" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[dol]]'' and ''[[med]]''. The word for head is used often in Sindarin to refer to hills.
