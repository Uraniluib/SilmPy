'''Sirion''' was a river of [[Middle-earth]] in the [[First Age]], the principal river of [[Beleriand]]. During most of its course it was the border between [[East Beleriand]] and [[West Beleriand]].  From the [[Pass of Sirion]] to its mouth, the river was 130 leagues in length.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

== Source ==
The Sirion's source was at [[Eithel Sirion]] on the eastern side of the [[Ered Wethrin]], which lay in between [[Ard-galen]] (later Anfauglith) and [[Mithrim]] and [[Hithlum]].<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref> It was guarded by the tower of [[Barad Eithel]].<ref name="Beleriand"/>

== Course ==
Sirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing through the [[Fen of Serech]] before entering the narrow steep-sided valley between the Ered Wethrin and the [[Echoriath]] named the Pass of Sirion. Sirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the [[Forest of Brethil]] to the west, and [[Dimbar]] and then [[Doriath]] to the east.  After leaving Doriath at Aelin-uial (the [[Fens of Sirion]]) it plunged below ground in the [[Falls of Sirion]] at [[Andram]] (the Long Wall), where the ground fell steeply. Three leagues southwards the Sirion exited the underground caves at the [[Gates of Sirion]]. It then flowed southwards through [[Nan-tathren|Nan-Tathren]] until it reached the [[Bay of Balar]], part of [[Belegaer]], at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref name="Map"/>

== Tributaries ==
In order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion were the [[Rivil]], flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen of Serech; the former [[Dry River]], the [[Mindeb]], which had its source in [[Nan Dungortheb]] and the [[Ered Gorgoroth]], the [[Teiglin]], the [[Esgalduin]] of Doriath; the [[Aros]] flowing south from Dorthonion and west along the [[Forest of Region]] (and also containing the waters of the [[Celon]] from the Hills of [[Himring]] and [[Himlad]]) which met at Aelin-uial, and the [[Narog]], which joined Sirion in Nan-Tathren.<ref name="Map"/>

== Crossing Points ==
The main crossing point was the [[Ford of Brithiach]] where the road from Himlad which crossed the Esgalduin at [[Iant Iaur]] crossed Sirion north of [[Brethil]]. There was also a bridge within Doriath.<ref name="Map"/> King [[Thingol]]'s [[Marchwardens]] also kept secret ferries near [[Aelin-uial]] to cross the river.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

== Settlements ==
Barad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a chief fortress of [[Fingolfin]] and his son [[Fingon]],<ref name="Beleriand"/> which guarded the pass into their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the [[Pass of Sirion]], lay [[Tol Sirion]] (see below). After the Coming of Men, the [[Edain]] of the [[House of Haleth]] made their home in the Forest of Brethil,<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> and the [[Sindar]] ruled by [[Thingol]] lay secure within the Girdle of [[Melian]] in their realm of Doriath.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction of [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], the Havens of Sirion were built by [[Círdan]] and his people.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

== Islands ==
The most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion.<ref name="Map"/> The original [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] was built here by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.<ref name="Beleriand"/> Shortly after [[Dagor Bragollach]] it was captured by Sauron and the island became known as [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
