The "'''Three Hunters'''" was the name that [[Aragorn]] bestowed upon the remnant of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]—including himself, [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]]<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>—on [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> as they began tracking the [[Uruk-hai]] that had captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] at [[Amon Hen]]. 
 
The Three Hunters descended [[Emyn Muil]] and entered [[Rohan]]; with Aragorn's tracking skills, they successfully followed the right track and even found Pippin's [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]], which had been dropped for them to find. The hunt continued for three days.<ref name="Riders">{{TT|III2}}</ref>
 
On [[30 February]] they encountered [[Éomer]]<ref name="Great"/> and his [[éored]] who had slaughtered the Orc-band the day before and were on the way back to [[Edoras]]. Éomer demanded their names and business and fighting almost broke out between Gimli and Éomer.  Aragorn prevented the fight and Éomer listened to their story of their journey and the losses of [[Gandalf]], [[Boromir]], and the two young hobbits.  Although Éomer believed that the hobbits must have been slain in the attack, he lent them two horses—[[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]]—and asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Edoras.
 
With their horses, the Three Hunters followed Éomer's instructions and reached the outskirts of [[Fangorn Forest]].  As night fell they encountered an old man who vanished, as did their horses.<ref name="Riders"/>  On [[1 March]] Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli met [[Gandalf]] the White and their hunt was over, although it was not until [[5 March]] that they again saw Merry and Pippin at [[Isengard]].<ref name="Great"/>  Later the two hobbits would follow other paths during the [[War of the Ring]] but Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stayed together to the end.
