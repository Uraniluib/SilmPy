}}'''Tar-Atanamir''' ([[Quenya|Q]] "Jewel of Man", pron. {{IPA|[aˈtanamir]}}) was the thirteenth [[King of Númenor]].

==History==
Tar-Atanamir succeeded his father, [[Tar-Ciryatan]], and ruled for 192 years, from {{SA|2029}} until his death, being the first King to rule for life. 

He was one of Númenor's most famous and powerful Kings but also one of its proudest and most greedy. By his time the Númenórean havens of [[Middle-earth]] had become fortreses holding [[Men]] in subjection, exacting tribute from them and bringing spoil back to Númenor. He was the first to speak openly against the Ban of the Valar (though he did not dare to actually defy the Ban). It was then when the people started being divided into the [[King's Men]] and the [[Faithful]].<ref name="AppN">{{App|Numenor}}</ref> His reign is thus generally considered to constitute the zenith of [[Númenor]]'s bliss, but also moral decline.

During his reign the [[Eldar]] reported to the [[Valar]] that the [[Númenóreans]] were beginning to speak against the [[Ban of the Valar]].  Aggrieved, [[Manwë]] sent messengers to Tar-Atanamir.  They explained that even if the Númenóreans could find the way to [[Aman]] it would not undo [[Gift of Men|their doom]]. Tar-Atanamir brought up the matter of his ancestor [[Eärendil]] who still lived in the sky, but according to the messengers his was a fate apart. Atanamir was unsatisfied that he and his people must abide the will of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

He was known as "the Great", and also "the Unwilling", because he was the first King of [[Númenor]] that refused to give up his life and the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] to his heir.<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Atanamir</ref> He lived on into old age and senility<ref name="Kings"/> Thus he begun a new tradition as every of his successors (with the notable exception of [[Tar-Palantir]]) did not relinquish his reign until death.

He was succeeded by his son, [[Tar-Ancalimon]].<ref name="AppN"/>  [[Herucalmo]], the husband of [[Tar-Vanimeldë]], also was descended from Tar-Atanamir.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Vanimeldë</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'', it said in {{SA|2251}} "Tar-Atanamir takes the sceptre", however, Atanamir died in 2221.  2221 is itself an emendation of 2251, and the former (2221) appears in the later tables, while the latter (2251) in the earlier tables: therefore 2251 (properly 2221) should have read "Death of Tar-Atanamir. Tar-Ancalimon takes the sceptre".<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Note 10</ref>
