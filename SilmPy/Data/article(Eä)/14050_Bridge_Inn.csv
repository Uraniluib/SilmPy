The '''Bridge Inn''' was an inn on the West side of [[Brandywine Bridge]] in [[the Shire]].  It was torn down by the [[Ruffians]] during the [[War of the Ring]], and replaced with a guard house.  [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were arrested here by the [[Shirriffs]] when they returned home from their adventures.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
