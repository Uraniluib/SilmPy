The so-called '''Lockholes''' were the storage tunnels of [[Michel Delving]], converted into prison cells when [[the Shire]] was taken over by [[Ruffians|Sharkey's Men]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>  In them were kept those who rebelled against the new regime, among whose inhabitants were [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]] [[Will Whitfoot]], [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]], and [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar "Fatty" Bolger]].

On [[4 November]] {{TA|3019}}, the day after the [[Battle of Bywater]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] rode to the Lockholes and released all of the prisoners.  Those kept in the Lockholes were treated to harsh conditions and starved.  Fredegar was no longer fat; in fact [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] had to help him to walk out.  Lobelia looked old and thin although she was able to hobble out on her own two feet; still, she died a few months later.  Will Whitfoot was debilitated enough that Frodo took on the job of Deputy Mayor until Will could regain his strength.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

In [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s poem, ''Perry-the-Winkle'',<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref> the [[Lonely Troll]] sat and wept outside of the Lockholes gate because he had no friends.  There [[Perry-the-Winkle]] befriended the [[Troll]] who in gratitude took him home where they had a "fulsome [[tea]]".  The inclusion of the word ''Lockholes'' indicates that Sam wrote the poem after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{AB|Perry}}, poem number 8</ref>
