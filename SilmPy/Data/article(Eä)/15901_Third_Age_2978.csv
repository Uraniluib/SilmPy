==Calculation of the Dates for Théodred and Elfhild==
In [[Appendix A]] it is stated that [[Éomund]], father of [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]], died in {{TA|3002}}.  His wife [[Théodwyn]], the beloved sister of King Théoden, died soon after.  The king took in his sister's children for he only had one child, Théodred, who in 3002 was 24 years old and thus was born in 2978.  It is also stated that Théoden's wife Elfhild died in childbirth.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line''</ref>
