The '''Dwarves of Belegost''' were a people of [[Dwarves]] who dwelt in the city of Belegost, the northernmost of the two great Dwarf-cities that stood in the Blue Mountains during the [[First Age]]. 

They had generally better relations with the [[Elves]] than their neighbors in [[Nogrod]], and were behind the building of [[Menegroth]]. The Dwarves of Belegost were friends to the [[Sindar]]<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> and later allies of the [[Noldor]] of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> They first met the [[Noldor]] Elves near [[Rerir|Mount Rerir]] and a great friendship began between the two peoples; [[Maedhros]] once saved Lord [[Azaghâl]] from an [[Orcs|Orc]]-assault.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, p. 75</ref> They joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] and fought bravely beside each other during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where they lost their ruler Lord [[Azaghâl]] in battle to the dragon [[Glaurung]].

When the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] assembled a great host of Dwarves to attack [[Doriath]], the Dwarves of Belegost tried to dissuade them from war, but their brethren from Nogrod did not heed their advice. These dwarves went on to fight in the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves]],<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> and later met their demise the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]]. After this tragedy the Dwarves of Belegost started leaving for [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], for fear of reprisal from the Elves. There was much loathing between Elf and Dwarf from there on.<ref name="Concerning">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

After the end of the [[First Age]], around {{SA|40}}, the power and wealth of Khazad-dûm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref name="Durin"/> However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref name="Concerning" />

In smithing, the Dwarves of Belegost were second only to the Dwarves of Nogrod. They learned many secrets in smithing from the Elves, and Elves from the Dwarves. They created many weapons for the Elves when evil began to stir in [[Beleriand]], and the smiths of Belegost were the first to create linked ring mail.
