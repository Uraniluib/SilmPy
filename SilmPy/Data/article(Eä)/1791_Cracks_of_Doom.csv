The '''Cracks of Doom''', also known as '''''Sammath Naur''''', was the forge and workshop of [[Sauron]] tunneled deep into [[Mount Doom]] and open to its central fire. It was in these fiery chambers that [[Sauron]] forged [[the One Ring]], and it was here that [[Frodo Baggins]] took the Ring to be destroyed.

==Etymology==
''Sammath Naur'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. 

''Sammath'' is [[Sindarin#Class Plural|collective plural]] of a word ''sam'' believed to mean "room, chamber"<ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html Hisweloke Sindarin dictionary]</ref>, cf. [[Quenya]] ''sambe''. Note that in the earlier ''[[Etymologies]]'' the [[Noldorin]] reflex of ''sambe'' was given as ''tham''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry STAB</ref>

The latter word (''[[naur]]'') means "fire".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 38</ref>

==Inspiration==
The name ''Cracks of Doom'' is a wordplay on "cracke of Doome" (''Macbeth''; IV i 117)  meaning the "sudden sound (crack) of the trump that announces the Last Day".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 767-8</ref> Here, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] uses "crack" to mean "fissure".
