{{disambig-two|the river|mother of [[Aragorn]]|[[Gilraen]]}}
'''Gilrain''' was a long river that flowed south out of the [[White Mountains]] through western [[Lebennin]] in the south of [[Gondor]]. Its tributary was [[Serni]], joining it above [[Linhir]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref><ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>
==Course==
The Gilrain flowed swiftly from its source until at the end of the outlier of the mountains it ran into a wide shallow depression.  In this area it wandered for awhile, forming a small mere before it cut through a ridge and fell in waterfalls, from whence it again flowed swiftly towards the [[Bay of Belfalas]], west of the [[Ethir Anduin]].<ref name=Amroth/>

==History==
Legend said that [[Nimrodel]] tarried there upon its banks as she came south out of the White Mountains, falling into a long sleep and thus missing [[Amroth]]'s ship.<ref name=Amroth>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The first element in the [[Sindarin]] name ''Gilrain'' is ''[[gil]]'' ("spark"), and the second element derives from the root [[RAN]] ("wander, stray").<ref name=Amroth/><ref>{{VT|42a}}, pp. 11-3</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The river Gilrain formed the border between the areas of [[Dor-en-Ernil]] and Lower [[Lebennin]] in the region of Central [[Gondor]]. The river was the domain of the gentle River-maid Roamingstar, one of the Five Sisters, who dwelt in the mere. Roamingstar lulled the elf-maid [[Nimrodel]] to sleep with her song and so accidentally caused the Elf to lose her beloved, [[Amroth]], a tragedy the River-maid still felt guilt for during the [[War of the Ring]]. She and her sisters were widely considered myths by then, but when her aid was sought for Gondor she gave it by preventing the Ruthless Dead from crossing her river into Lebennin.
