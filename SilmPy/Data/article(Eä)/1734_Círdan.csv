'''Círdan''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈkiːrdan]}}) was a [[Sindar|Sindarin Elf]], and Lord of the [[Falathrim]] during the First Age. He was one of the wisest and most foresighted of the [[Elves]], and by the [[Second Age]] the oldest known [[Elves|elf]] in [[Middle-earth]], to remain so throughout that age and the [[Third Age]].  He was also awarded [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]], until he surrendered it to [[Gandalf]].  He was one of the last elves in Middle-earth, sailing West at last probably sometime in the [[Fourth Age]].

The [[Quenya]] form of Círdan's name is '''[[Ciryatan]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈkirʲatan]}}).

==History==
===Early History===

Círdan, born '''[[Nowë]]'''<ref name="LastWritingsN">{{PM|Last}}, "Círdan", note 30</ref> ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈnowe]}}), was kin of both [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]], a lord in the host of the former.  During the push westward, seeking to go to [[Valinor]], Nowë and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.  Despite Nowë's great eagerness to see the [[light of Valinor]] (his "greatest desire"),<ref name="LastWritings">{{PM|Last}}, "Círdan"</ref> he loyally searched for Elwë upon his disappearance.  Because of this the [[Teleri]] missed the first trip on [[Tol Eressëa]] to [[Valinor]], on which went their kin, the [[Noldor]] and the [[Vanyar]].  They took for their king [[Olwë]], and while waiting for [[Ulmo]] to return for them, Nowë headed the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession he took the name '''Círdan''' which means "shipwright" in [[Sindarin]]. The Teleri also developed a great friendship with [[Ossë]].  At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, Círdan sought Elwë longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.

Because of this, Círdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eressëa.  He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eressëa as it vanished into the West over [[Belegaer]].  Then he cried aloud:
{{quote|I will follow that light, alone if none will come with me, for the ship that I have been building is now almost ready.|Círdan, ''[[Last Writings]]''}}
But into his heart came a message from the [[Valar]] which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work be of utmost worth, remembered in song. Círdan answered in obeyance, and saw a vision of [[Vingilot|a ship]].

===Foundation and Return of the Noldor===
Círdan therefore remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Ossë, and became their lord.  The folk became known as the [[Falathrim]], "''people of the foaming shore''", and dwelt in the [[Falas]] by the sea.  There they built many ships, and the cities [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], and found pearls which they sent to their overlord, King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], who was once Elwë.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

When [[Morgoth|Belegurth]] broke forth in the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] in {{YT|1497}}, Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol’s aid.  Further, although Thingol conquered with the help of the [[Laiquendi]], the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the [[Return of the Noldor]], when [[Fëanor]] struck [[Morgoth]] from the north.  The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the [[Orcs]] were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by [[Celegorm]].  The Falas were saved.

Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor, and quite possibly met and befriended his later neighbors and friends [[Turgon]] and [[Finrod]].  Although Turgon eventually moved from [[Vinyamar]] to faraway [[Gondolin]], Círdan’s friendship with Finrod was lasting,<ref name="Belerian">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and Círdan became a close advisor to the Noldo.  Círdan was, after all, a relative of his, being related (probably quite closely) to Olwë, Finrod’s grandfather.

===Early First Age===

When the tales began spreading (sown by [[Belegurth]]) of the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]], Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice.  Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers.  Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard.  This resulted in the banishment of [[Quenya]], and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.

Círdan may have assisted in the [[Dagor Aglareb]], but this is unknown.  Nevertheless he did not take part in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], as he was far away and not directly attacked, if even he had time to come to the aid of his allies.  Nevertheless Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the [[Second Assault on Hithlum]], coming to the timely aid of [[Fingon]] when he was most needed.  They sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]], then struck the unsuspecting [[orcs]] from the west, giving victory to the elves.<ref name="Fingolfin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], many fugitives came for shelter in the Falas.  The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea.  But it was only a matter of time before [[Morgoth]] attacked.  Then came the disastrous [[Fall of the Falas]].  Though both [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Morgoth had in his train.  The elves fought valiantly, but the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved.  [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste.  But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him [[Gil-galad]], one of the last of the princes of the Noldor.  They came to the [[Isle of Balar]] and founded a new kingdom, but kept a foothold at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], keeping ships hidden in the reeds there, making a refuge for all who fled there.<ref name="Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===Lord of Balar===

Turgon, receiving the dreadful news, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek [[Valinor]] and the aid of the [[Valar]].  Círdan built seven swift ships, and sent them westward.  None returned, save for only one mariner of the [[Gondolindrim]].  The way to the West was closed.<ref name="Fifth"/>{{Pronounce|Cirdan.mp3|Ardamir}}

Eventually Círdan served as messenger, when [[Ulmo]] delivered him a message for [[Orodreth]], warning of the doom of [[Nargothrond]], and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge.  The warning went unheeded, resulting of the [[Fall of Nargothrond]].

After news came to Balar of the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Gil-galad]] was proclaimed [[High King of the Noldor]].  Círdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf [[Eärendil]] son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him.  Círdan aided Eärendil in building the ship [[Vingilot]], giving him advice and help.  Círdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.<ref name="LastWritings"/>

Círdan and Gil-galad came with their armies from the Isle of Balar too late to prevent the disastrous [[Third Kinslaying]], when the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] were ambushed and many fell.  But Eärendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the [[Silmaril]] of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] had been spirited away by [[Elwing]] his wife.  Thus, wielding the Silmaril, Eärendil came to [[Valinor]] and found the forgiveness of the [[Valar]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>  From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the elves,<ref name="LastWritings"/> perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of [[Glorfindel]], who also contributed significantly).  After the [[War of Wrath]], Círdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart’s desire and going West, but with a small following remained in [[Middle-earth]].

===Second Age===

The continents were shifted, but Círdan still took up his abode by the sea, in [[Harlindon]] with [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]].<ref name="Galadriel">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>  Harlindon was located south of the [[Gulf of Lune]], to the north of which was [[Forlindon]], where [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] dwelt.  There he welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen [[Númenóreans]], making friends with [[Vëantur]], chief of the mariners of [[Tar-Elendil]], and later teaching [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] his grandson of ships (both management and construction) and seaside architecture,<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref> doubtless being the foremost authority on both.  At some point he moved to [[Mithlond]].

Círdan advised against the creation of the [[Rings of Power]] when [[Sauron|Annatar]] came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the joy and enthusiasm of the [[Eregion]]-elves, and especially [[Celebrimbor]].  Nevertheless, when the [[Three Rings]] escaped the [[Sack of Eregion]], Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them.  He received [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>  [[Sauron]], having revealed himself in the destruction of Eregion and empowered by [[the One Ring]] he had forged, [[sack of Eregion|invaded]] [[Eriador]] in the same blow. Nevertheless, though he killed many elves, he dared not attempt to take Mithlond or Lindon, feeling they were too strong and because they had the help of the Númenóreans.  Indeed, they were his bane in that chapter of history, for the Númenóreans came and pushed him back beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], ending the [[Dark Years]].<ref name="Rings"/>

Eventually there came the [[Akallabêth|Fall of Númenor]], when the great man-isle of Númenor was overturned and [[Aman]] removed from the circles of the world.  But [[Elendil]] escaped with his sons to [[Middle-earth]] and founded the [[Reunited Kingdom|Two Kingdoms]] over a vast space of land, on both sides of the Misty Mountains.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>  This new kingdom of men profoundly impacted the lives of the elves of Lindon, as is seen in the [[War of the Last Alliance]].

Círdan joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|alliance]], and fought steadily beside his friends and comrades.  Many fell there, including [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]].  Yet again Círdan outlived those around him, and survived the battle.  With Elrond he urged [[Isildur]], Elendil’s first-born, to throw the captured One Ring into [[Orodruin]], where it would be unmade.<ref name="Rings"/><ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>  But Isildur refused.

===Third Age===
The early years of the [[Third Age]] were, for Círdan and the elves, mostly a time to catch their breaths after the fall of Sauron in the War of the Alliance.  For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed,<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> but at around {{TA|1050}} a shadow began to lengthen.  Though many deemed that Sauron was defeated forever, for the first time in many centuries some evil was stirring, and awake.  It was at this time the [[Istari]], sent by the [[Valar]], came.  Though the [[Blue Wizards]] and [[Glorfindel]] may have come earlier during the [[Second Age]], and Círdan most probably greeted them in [[Mithlond]], it is known for sure that he met [[Gandalf]] there.  Círdan was one of the few of the [[Wise]] left; of the other ancient elves, only Celeborn, Galadriel, Glorfindel (who was resurrected), and Elrond remained.  He was the most foresighted of all of them, and alone knew the true purpose of the Istari.  He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him [[Narya]], his greatest possession and one of the most secret and sought-after treasures in the world.
{{quote|Take this ring, Master… for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself.  For this is the Ring of Fire, and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill.  But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails.  I will await you.|Círdan, ''[[Appendix B]]''}}

In {{TA|1409}}, Círdan aided King [[Araphor]] of [[Arnor]] in battle against [[Angmar]] during the Fall of Rhudaur, after [[Weathertop]] was burned.  With Círdan’s help, young Araphor drove the wraith’s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]].<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  The second time Círdan came to the aid of men was four and a half centuries later, in {{TA|1975}}, when Círdan sent a ship north to [[Forochel]] to rescue the lost [[Arnor]]ian king [[Arvedui]].  The crew endured a perilous journey, but found Arvedui.  Yet Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished.<ref name="Gondor"/>  The next year Círdan mustered the elves to join with the [[Dúnedain]] in the victorious [[Battle of Fornost]].  Later Círdan took control of the abandoned [[palantíri|Elendil Stone]] on [[Emyn Beraid]], which could gaze into the [[Tol Eressëa|lost west]] and was without link to the other ''palantíri''.<ref name="Palantiri">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>

Círdan was invited onto the [[White Council]] when it was formed in {{TA|2463}} in response to the rise of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], whose identity was at that point concealed.  Throughout all the recorded history of the White Council, his actions go unrecorded.  His role may have only been passive; as an advisor rather than a planner.  At any rate, nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the [[War of the Ring]] in {{TA|3018}} and later {{TA|3021}}.  [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was his messenger to [[Rivendell]], though for reasons unknown.  It may be that he, too, felt the growing shadow, even as his friend [[Gandalf]] did.  Sent by Círdan "on errand", Galdor attended the [[Council of Elrond]], speaking with authority on his lord’s behalf.<ref name="Council"/>

[[File:Decipher - Círdan.jpg|left|thumb|[[Decipher]] - ''Círdan'']]The last mention of Círdan came with the end of the Third Age.  When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, Círdan greeted them before the gates.  Although [[Gandalf]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]] passed west on the ship he had built for them, Círdan seems to have remained for a time.  Eventually, however, he passed west on the last ship, fulfilling his heart’s desire that had waited so long.{{fact}}

==Characteristics and Impact==
In the last years of the Third Age, Círdan appeared very old save for his eyes which "''were keen as stars''", wearing a long beard.<ref name="Havens">{{RK|Havens}}</ref> Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his [[Elven life cycle#"Cycles of life" and aging|third cycle of life]].<ref>{{VT|41b}}, p. 9</ref>

Círdan had a profound effect upon the course of Middle-earth history.  He was a loyal servant and friend of [[Elwë]], sacrificing his heart’s desire in search of him.<ref name="LastWritings"/>  This loyalty and sense of duty shows up numerous times over the course of history, including his second sacrifice in his submission to the [[Valar]],<ref name="LastWritings"/> and his sending of troubling and potentially destructive rumors to his overlord Thingol.  He was also the most foresighted of the elves, a gift from the Valar.<ref name="AppB2"/><ref name="LastWritings"/>  He conceivably saved Elven civilization with the founding of the havens at the [[Mouths of Sirion]],<ref name="Fifth"/> and with the fostering of both [[Gil-galad]] and [[Eärendil]].<ref name="Earendil"/>  His precious gift of [[Narya]] to [[Gandalf]] was also timely and valuable.<ref name="AppB2"/>  He was clearly favored by [[Ulmo]], seen by the number of messages passed through him.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:His role as lieutenant of Gil-galad is given to [[Elrond]] instead (Elrond was Gil-galad's herald in the books). He does, however, appear very briefly in Galadriel's Monologue at the start of the movie, in the very brief shot of the three elven ringbearers.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Círdan briefly appears as Frodo and Bilbo make their trip to the lands of the West.
