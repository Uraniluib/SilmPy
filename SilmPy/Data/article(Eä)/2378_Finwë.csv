'''Finwë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈfinwe]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈɸinwe]}}) was the first [[King of the Noldor]], who led his people on the journey from Middle-earth to [[Valinor]] in the blessed realm of [[Aman]]. He was a great friend of [[Thingol|Elwë]], who would later become the [[King of Doriath]].

==History==
===Life in Middle-earth===

The first [[Elves]] awoke in [[Middle-earth]] near the bay of the [[Sea of Helcar]], called [[Cuiviénen]], in {{YT|1050}}<ref name="Annals">{{MR|P2e}}, pp. 71-4</ref>. [[Oromë]], The Huntsman of the [[Valar]], while traveling near the [[Orocarni]] mountains, discovered the Elves and bonded friendship with their kin.

Later, as the Valar decided to call the first Children of [[Ilúvatar]] in Valinor, regarding this call with suspicion, Oromë selected three elves to follow him into Aman and report back what they have seen, in the hopes that they could decimate the fears which were seeded into the hearts of the elves by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. The three elven ambassadors were [[Ingwë]], Finwë and [[Thingol|Elwë]], who would later become kings of the three factions into which the elven race was split.<ref name=S3>{{S|3}}</ref>

Enamored by the wonders of Valinor, Finwë and his other two companions returned towards the Middle-earth and attempted to convince their respective peoples to follow them back into Aman. Those who agreed to follow Oromë received the name [[Eldar]]. Among them were Finwë's people, who would eventually become known as the [[Noldor]]. They later became students of [[Aulë]] the Smith.<ref name=S3/> Finwë's eldest son, [[Fëanor]], would become the greatest craftsman among the Elves of Valinor.<ref name=S5/>

===Life in Valinor ===
[[Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - Finwe Heraldic Device.jpg|thumb|125px|Finwë's Heraldic Device]]
Upon arriving in the blessed realm of Aman, Finwë was troubled only by the separation from his friend [[Thingol|Elwë]] who chose to remain in [[Beleriand]]. The Noldor settled on the hill of [[Túna]], raised for them by the Valar and, led by Finwë, they lived in the city of [[Tirion]], whom they shared with the [[Vanyar]]. It was during the building of Finwë's house that the masons found the earth-gems from which they crafted countless jewels to be given freely for the enrichment of Valinor. Later, Ingwë and his people left the city of Tirion and Finwë remained the only king to rule in Tirion.<ref name=S5>{{S|5}}</ref>

Finwë's first wife was [[Míriel|Míriel Serindë]], skilled in all things that required fineness. From their love a son was born, [[Fëanor|Curufinwë]], who would later become known as Fëanor. As he was brought into the world, he depleted Míriel's strength and zest for life and she requested to be allowed to rest in the gardens of [[Irmo|Lórien]]. Finwë was deeply saddened by this event. He did not wish to leave the young child without a mother, nor did he want him to be their last. But as his wife explained that what would have nourished many children, was all invested in Fëanor, he had no other choice but to accept her request. And thus Míriel, with [[Manwë]]'s counsel, was placed asleep in Irmo's gardens. Her [[fëa]] eventually departed from her body and she became the first person to die in Aman.<ref name=S6>{{S|6}}</ref>
[[File:Steamey - Finwë Mourning Míriel.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''Finwë Mourning Míriel'']]
This was a shocking event for all those present in Valinor, as never one of their own had died of free will. For some time, Finwë lived in sorrow and he often visited Míriel's body, but as his loneliness and lack of joy increased, he stopped seeing her altogether. His entire love now rested with his son, Fëanor, who grew up to be mighty and skilled in all things of hands and mind. He married [[Nerdanel]] and gave Finwë [[Sons of Fëanor|seven grandchildren]].

But Finwë was not content in living alone and he sought to marry for the second time. His second wife was [[Indis|Indis the Fair]], a golden haired [[Vanya]], whom he loved and rejoiced in. She gave him two sons, [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]], and two daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]]<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>. Though he was now blissful again, the shadow of Míriel never left the House, especially since Fëanor opposed his father's second marriage.

The sons of Finwë never lived together and never shared close bonds. After the later events surrounding the [[Silmarils]] many blamed Finwë and his desire to have a second wife for the dreadful future misfortune of all those of his House. These accusations had no real merit, as Finwë had always loved his eldest son above all others, and the events surrounding his death would prove it.

===Death===
After three ages of imprisonment, Melkor was released from the duress of [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]] and, as he gained the trust of the Valar again, he was eventually allowed to roam freely in Valinor.<ref name=S6>{{S|6}}</ref> The treacherous Melkor lusted for the Silmarils, those three great jewels made by the hands of Fëanor, at the might of his skill, and ever he sought a way to steal them. He had sown such lies that all the Noldor began to feel strife and mistrust, against themselves, against the other Elves, and even against the Valar.

The [[House of Finwë]] was no exception. There were already grounds of argument between his sons, and these events only served to deepen these rifts. Finwë called a council and tried to moderate them towards one another. For the moment, his action seemed to be crowned with success, as Fingolfin bowed before Finwë, both privately and publically, to silence the mistrust and arguments he had in regards to his eldest brother. Soon after that the Valar called Fëanor to answer for his words against them. The stem of the evil was exposed and Melkor's covert actions revealed. However, Fëanor too was sentenced to twelve years of exile, and he removed himself north, to the fortress of [[Formenos]]. Due to the great love he had for his eldest son, Finwë renounced his throne as the King of the Noldor and followed Fëanor into exile.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

In his fixation to have the Silmarils for himself, Melkor went as far as to claim them at the gates of Formenos. He was fiercely rejected by Fëanor, while Finwë sent messengers to Manwë. It was during a time of festival, that Melkor returned. All the people of Valinor were engaged in the festivities except Finwë, who, out of devotion for Fëanor and bitterness for his son's exile, chose to remain in Formenos, thus refusing to obey Manwë's call.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> After Melkor and [[Ungoliant]] destroyed the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], they headed towards Formenos. Alone Finwë had the courage to stand before the horror of the Darkness. There, before the doors of Formenos, the former King of the Noldor had been killed and the first blood was spilled in the realm of Aman. Melkor forcefully entered the fortress and stole the Silmarils, sending the Blessed Realm into darkness and causing the Noldor to depart from Valinor.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

After his death, Finwë dwelt for a time in the Halls of Mandos where he met Míriel, his first wife. Later, when the Valar agreed that Finwë should be brought back to life, he instead decided not to, thus giving Míriel a chance to be reincarnated.<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 207</ref>

==Etymology==

The name ''Finwë'' is said to be one of the oldest recorded names of the Eldar. It is not certain if ''Finwë'' had any clear meaning, but it can be analyzed as ''fin-'' (derived from [[Common Eldarin]] PHIN "hair") + ''[[-wë]]'' (suffix generally used for male names).<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 340</ref>


The title '''''Ñoldóran''''', "King of the Ñoldor", was an other recorded name of Finwë.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 343</ref> It is apparently a compound of ''[[Noldo]]'' and ''[[aran]]'' ("king").<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm}}</ref>

== Genealogy ==
Finwë had two wives. His first was [[Míriel]], who passed away soon after bearing their only child, [[Fëanor]]. His second wife was [[Indis]], of the [[Vanyar]], who bore him two sons: [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]], and two daughters: [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==

In the first drafts of the genealogy, Finwë had four sons: the youngest was named ''[[Finrun]]'', but he was dropped after that, thus [[Finrod]] (later [[Finarfin]]) was Finwë's youngest son from then on.

In a later version Finwë had three daughters by [[Indis]], [[Findis]] (as their first child) [[Faniel]] (as their third), and [[Finvain]] (as their youngest).<ref>{{PM|XI}}, p. 359 note 26</ref> In yet later versions, Faniel was apparently dropped, while Findis and Finvain were kept. Finvain (renamed [[Írimë]]) was moved to after Fingolfin, thus Finarfin was once again the youngest child of Finwë.
