The '''Field of Cormallen''' was a tree-lined field in [[North Ithilien]], on the banks of the [[Anduin]] near [[Cair Andros]] and [[Henneth Annûn]].<ref name=RKCorm/>

It is told that the tree ''[[culumalda]]'', having yellow flowers, was especially abundant in Cormallen<ref name=RC/>
==History==
After returning from the [[Battle of the Morannon]], [[Aragorn]] set up his camp on the Fields of Cormallen in {{TA|3019}}. There, he received [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] after their rescue from the wreckage of [[Mount Doom]]. They were greeted by many friends, and were praised in the celebration of the victory in the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=RKCorm>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref><ref name=RC/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Cormallen'' is [[Sindarin]] and means "golden circle" (from ''[[cor]]'', "ring" and ''[[mallen]]'' "gold"). Apparently the name derived from the tree ''[[culumalda]]''.<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 625-6 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref><ref>{{S|Appendix}} (entry for ''al-'')</ref>

The [[Gondorians]] likely used the name ''Cormalthen'' as in [[Gondor Sindarin]] compounds retained the [[wikipedia:Fricative consonant|spirant]]. The spelling ''Cormallen'' follows the "proper" Elvish Sindarin, ''malt'' ("gold") and ending ''-en'' became *''mallen'', however in Gondor this remained ''malthen''.<ref name="VT4227">{{VT|42}}, [[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]], pages 5-31, esp. 27</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Carl F.
