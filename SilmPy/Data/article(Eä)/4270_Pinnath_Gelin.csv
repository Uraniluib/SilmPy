==Etymology==
Usually translated as '''Green Hills''',<ref name="MT"/> and sometimes as '''Green Downs''',<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 525 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref> the meaning of the name ''Pinnath Gelin'' would be actually closer to Green Ridges, Green Slopes or Green Crests. The first word was the dialectical [[Sindarin]] or [[Gondor Sindarin]] ''[[pinnath]]''. The second was the plural of the word ''[[calen]]'', "green".<ref name="PE1724">{{PE|17}}, p. 24</ref>
