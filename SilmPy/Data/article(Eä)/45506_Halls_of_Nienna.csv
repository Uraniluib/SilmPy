The '''halls of Nienna''' lay at the westernmost border of [[Aman]], near the [[halls of Mandos]]. Here dwelt the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Nienna]] and it is said that the windows of her house looked "outward from the [[Walls of the World|walls of the world]]".<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
As described in an early version of the [[legendarium]], Nienna chose for her dwelling a wide and dark hall in the [[Halls of Mandos|courts of Mandos]]. This hall she named '''Fui''', and therein:

{{blockquote|before her black chair burnt a brazier with a single flickering coal, and the roof was of [[bats]]' wings, and the pillars that upheld it and the walls about were made of basalt.|}}

At Fui was summoned the [[Men]] after death, to await their doom.<ref group=note>Christopher Tolkien has noted that this conception changes in later versions, where it is instead [[Mandos]] who appears as the Doomsman of the Valar ({{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 90).</ref><ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 77</ref>
