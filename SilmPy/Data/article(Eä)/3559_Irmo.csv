'''Irmo''',  more commonly known as ''Lórien'', was the [[Valar|Vala]] who was the master of visions and dreams and kept the [[Lórien (Valinor)|Gardens of Lórien]].

==History==
Irmo was the younger brother of [[Mandos|Námo]]. Irmo and Námo were the [[Fëanturi]], the masters of spirits.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> Their sister was [[Nienna]]. Like his brother, Mandos, Irmo was typically known by the name of his domain, Lórien. 

In his gardens, he dwelt with his spouse [[Estë]]. His halls and extensive gardens were located away from [[Valmar]] though still within [[Valinor]]. Irmo tended to the [[Elves]] of Valinor in Lórien and provided a peaceful refuge. He would guide the [[Eldar]] with visions and dreams.<ref name=vala/>

When [[Míriel]] became life weary after giving birth to [[Fëanor]], she was brought to Lórien for rest and solace. But her spirit willingly departed to [[Mandos]], and she refused to return.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

When the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] were originally set in their paths, [[Varda]] purposed that the two vessels should journey in [[Ilmen]] and mingle their light as the [[Two Trees]] once had. However, Irmo and Estë asked her to reconsider as "sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth."<ref name=Sun/> Therefore, Varda changed her council and allowed for a time of night where the world would still have shadows and half-light.<ref name=Sun>{{S|11}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Irmo'' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈirmo]}}) is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "Desirer" or "Master of Desire".<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> His common name ''Lórien'' ([[Quenya]]; {{IPA|[ˈloːri.en]}}) means "Land of Dreams".

In early versions of the legendarium, this Vala (variously spelt '''''Lorien''''' and '''''Lôrien''''') was given many different surnames: [[Qenya]] '''''Olofantur''''' (the element ''fantur'', a derivative of the [[Sundocarme|root]] FANA, refers to "visions, dreams, falling asleep")<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 253, 259</ref>, Qenya '''''Fulmur''''' (probably from the root FUMU, "sleep"), and [[Gnomish]] '''''Losfan''''' (consisting of ''oloth'' "a dream, apparition, vision" + ending ''-fan'', thus ''(o)loth-fan'' > ''Losfan'').<ref name=PE14>{{PE|14}}, p. 12</ref> Gnomish renderings of his first name included '''''Glurim''''' (containing the element ''lûr'' "slumber") and '''''Lûriel''''' or '''''Lúriel''''' (> '''''Lúrin''''').<ref name=PE14/><ref name=LT1/><ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 18</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Irmo is referred to as ''Swefnfréa'' "Dream-ruler".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Poppies, the flowers of sleep "which the Gods called ''fumellar''," were used in enchantments by Irmo. And in the silvery light of the cauldron ''Silindrin'', which held the collected dew of [[Telperion]], he descried many mysterious visions.<ref name=irmo>{{LT1|III}}</ref>
