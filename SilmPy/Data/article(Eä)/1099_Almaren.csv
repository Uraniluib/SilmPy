The Isle of '''Almaren''' lay in the midst of the [[Great Lake]] in the center of [[Middle-earth]] when all the lands and seas were symmetrical, and thus the island was the midmost point of all [[Arda]].

==History==
In the 1,500th Valian year since the coming of many of the [[Valar]] to Arda, another Vala came to the aid of [[Manwë]].  This was [[Tulkas]] the Strong who caused [[Melkor]] to abandon Middle-earth.<ref name="Annal">{{MR|P2a}}</ref>  In the peace that followed the Valar were able to bring order to the seas and lands,<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref> and it may have been that Almaren was created at that time.

By the Valian year 1,900 [[Aulë]] had wrought the [[Two Lamps]], [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]], and [[Varda]] had given them hallowed fire that lit Arda and brought living things to life.  Almaren certainly did exist by this time, for being between the Two Lamps all things grew richest and fairest upon the island and the Valar made their dwelling there (though they were often abroad upon their business).

When at last the Valar were content Manwë ordained a great feast upon the isle in the Valian year 3,400.  At the feast Tulkas wed Nessa and then slept, for he was weary with his labors in the ordering of Arda.  Seeing his chance, Melkor and his host surmounted the [[Walls of Night]] and began the delving of [[Utumno]] in the north.  His coming marred the [[Spring of Arda]], turning many living things sick, rotted, or corrupted.  The Valar then knew that Melkor was returned but did not know his hiding-place.  

In the year 3,450 Melkor came forth in war and cast down the Two Lamps.  Their destruction broke the lands and roiled the seas.  The dwelling of the Valar upon Almaren was utterly destroyed and the island and the Great Lake disappeared in the tumult.<ref name="Annal"/>
