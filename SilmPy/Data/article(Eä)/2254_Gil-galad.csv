'''Ereinion Gil-galad''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈreɪnjon ˈɡilɡalad]}}) was the sixth and last [[High King of the Noldor]]. 

== History ==
===First Age===
The exact date and place of Gil-galad's birth is not given.

He was still a child at the time of the [[Dagor Bragollach]] when [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]]. As a result his father<ref group=note>In the [[Silmarillion]], Gil-galad's father was [[Fingon]]; in later notes [[Tolkien]] changed him to [[Orodreth]], but never incorporated this change in a narrative. See [[#Other Versions of the Legendarium]]</ref> sent him (and his mother<ref name="Ruin">{{WJ|Ruin}}</ref>) to [[Círdan]] at the [[Havens of the Falas]] for safekeeping.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> After the fall of Minas Tirith, the [[Pass of Sirion]] was open to Morgoth's hosts although they were still kept at bay by the still mighty realm of [[Hithlum]] and also the power of Nargothrond. Hithlum was destroyed after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] and thus there was no power left that could withstand the enemies, and the ports at the Falas were besieged and captured. Yet Círdan, Gil-galad and many other Elves could flee from death on ship and established a refuge upon the [[Isle of Balar]] and a small haven at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad [[Fingon]], High King of the Noldor, was slain, and the crown passed to his brother [[Turgon]] in Gondolin. When Gondolin was lost, Gil-galad received the Kingship of the Noldor.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> He and Círdan maintained the refuge upon Balar and the small port at the Sirion estuary until the [[War of Wrath]] and the end of the First Age.

===Second Age===
After the destruction of [[Beleriand]] during the [[War of Wrath]], Gil-galad founded a kingdom in [[Lindon]] in the far northwest of Middle-earth, roughly between the [[Blue Mountains]] and the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] around the [[Gulf of Lhûn]] and the havens of [[Forlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]] and [[Mithlond]] were founded.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Many Elves, both the [[Sindar]] and the [[Noldor]] joined him. But soon there was again unrest among the Noldor, and many of them left Lindon and led by [[Celebrimbor]] founded the realm of [[Eregion]], probably also stirred up by the finding of ''[[mithril]]'' in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. Also some of the Sindar and many of the [[Nandor]] did not wish to live with the Noldor, who had done them a [[Second Kinslaying|great evil]], and migrated eastwards to [[Lothlórien]] or [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].

When Prince [[Aldarion]] of [[Númenor]] came to [[Middle-earth]], they established friendship with the [[Elves]]. In {{SA|882}} Gil-galad gave him [[Gil-galad's letter|a letter for his father]], the [[King of Númenor]], [[Tar-Meneldur]]. He warned him that a new shadow had arisen in the [[East]] and besought him for aid.<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>

[[File:Lelia - Gil-Galad.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Lelia - ''Gil-galad'']]Around the year 1000 of the [[Second Age]], [[Sauron]] tried to make contact with the Elves under the name of [[Annatar]], the "Lord of Gifts". But Gil-galad and Círdan did not trust him and rejected his proposals. Sauron though, was welcomed in Eregion and the [[Rings of Power]] were forged.<ref name="Rings"/> Around {{SA|1600}} Sauron, though, had forged [[the One Ring]] in secret, and when the Elves of Eregion found out that they have been betrayed, Sauron demanded the Rings, and when they refused, in {{SA|1695}} he invaded [[Eriador]], and the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Second}}</ref> Celebrimbor had rescued the Three Rings of the Elves in time, sending [[Narya]] and [[Vilya]] to Gil-galad, while the third ring [[Nenya]] was given to [[Galadriel]].<ref name="Galadriel">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

Sauron conquered [[Eregion]] quickly and the forces from Lindon that Gil-galad had sent under the command of [[Elrond]] came too late and were too small, and fled far north, where Elrond established the stronghold of [[Rivendell|Imladris]].<ref name="Galadriel"/> While Sauron sent most of his army west to attack [[Lindon]] he had to leave a strong detachment behind to contain Elrond.<ref name=UTC>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

The war lasted on, until a great fleet of the [[Númenóreans]] arrived at Lindon. With united forces, Sauron's army was driven back and defeated near the [[Sarn Ford]] and withdrew to [[Tharbad]] where he was reinforced. But the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] had sent a fleet up the river Gwathló and Sauron's army was [[Battle of the Gwathló|attacked in the rear and utterly defeated]].<ref name="Galadriel"/> After this war, the Elves were not further troubled by Sauron for a long time. During this time, Gil-galad passed the rings Narya and Vilya to Círdan and Elrond, respectively, and he appointed Elrond as his vice-regent.<ref name="Galadriel"/>.

When [[Tar-Calion]] captured Sauron and took him to [[Númenor]], the Westlands found peace, and Gil-galad was free to extend his power to the north and south, and east, beyond [[Anduin]].<ref name="Rings"/>

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], [[Elendil]] and his sons came to Middle-earth and founded the realms of [[Gondor]] in the south and [[Arnor]] in the north. Gondor was soon attacked by Sauron and Elendil's son [[Isildur]] had to flee, and sailed north to his father, where the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was formed with Gil-galad. 
[[File:Maureval - Ereinion Gil-galad.jpg|thumb|Maureval - ''Ereinion Gil-galad'']]
It took several years for the Allies to gather their forces but ultimately they marched on Mordor and defeated a great army in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. They broke through [[Cirith Gorgor]] and besieged [[Sauron]]'s [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]]. 

When the siege had lasted for seven years, it became so pressing that Sauron himself sallied forth. By his power the siege was broken and his army advanced to the slopes of [[Orodruin]]. There he was engaged by Elendil and Gil-galad in a single combat. Sauron was defeated but both Gil-galad and Elendil were killed in the act. Gil-galad was the last High King of Noldor. In the scroll he left in [[Minas Tirith]] before riding north, Isildur wrote that Gil-galad was killed by the heat of Sauron's hand.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Gil-galad's weapon was the spear [[Aeglos (spear)|Aeglos]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==

Gil-galad was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of [[Fëanor]]. 

Later, and through the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he was considered a son of [[Finrod Felagund]], until Tolkien decided that Felagund was unmarried and childless. 

A marginal note by Tolkien from around this time (the late 1950s) suggested that Gil-galad might be the son of [[Fingon]]. This suggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor [[Christopher Tolkien]] in the published version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which states that Gil-galad is the son of [[Fingon]]. He also edited a line in ''[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife]]'' which originally referred to Gil-galad as a member of the House of Finarfin to make it consistent with the published ''Silmarillion''. Christopher stated many years later in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' that this decision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on his part and did not represent his father's conception of the character. Christopher suggested that it would have been better to have left Gil-galad's parentage obscure.<ref name="PM|XI5">{{PM|XI5}}</ref>
 
Tolkien's final decision for Gil-galad's parentage appears to have been that he was a son of [[Orodreth]], who was at the same time changed from being a son of [[Finarfin]] to a son of [[Angrod]].<ref name="PM|XI5">{{PM|XI5}}</ref> This conception, however, was never incorporated into the written stories of ''The Silmarillion'', and aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of Angrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing text.

== Etymology ==
 
''Gil-galad'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, meaning "Star of bright light". The name consists of the elements ''[[gil]]'' ("star") + ''[[galad]]'' ("radiance")<ref name=RGEO>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 73</ref>. According to a note this name was given to him because of the brightness of his eyes <ref name="Ruin"/>.
 
''Gil-galad ''was his [[Amilessë|mother-name]], and it was his preferred name in his youth. His [[father-name]] was '''''Rodnor''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈrodnor]}}), or in [[Quenya]], '''''Artanáro''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌartaˈnaːro]}}).

As a High King of the Noldor, his [[epessë]] was '''''Ereinion''''', "Scion of Kings" (from ''[[erain]]'' = "kings" and ''[[-ion]]'' = "son").

==Portrayals in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings (film series) - Gil-galad.jpg|thumb|Gil-galad in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:In the prologue, Gil-galad is shown as one of the bearers of the [[Three Rings|three Elven rings]]. Later, he is present at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr|Battle]] of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] wielding his spear [[Aeglos (spear)|Aeglos]]. His death is not shown, and he does not take down [[Sauron]]. He is played by [[Mark Ferguson]].

'''2010: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:Gil-galad appears in the prologue holding one of the Elf-rings. He is also an unlockable character, despite never playing into the storyline. He can be found in a cave in south-west [[Gorgoroth]]. His gear is not accurate, however; he wields an Elven sword (instead of Aeglos) and golden shield in the game, though ''The Fall of Gil-Galad'' describes a silver shield.
