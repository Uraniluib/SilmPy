'''Ausir''' was an [[Elf]] of [[Tol Eressëa]] and one of the children in the [[Cottage of Lost Play]]. He told [[Eriol]] of the fate of [[Huan]] the Hound, and revealed to him that the old man whose guidance brought him to the Lonely Isle was none other than [[Ulmo]] himself.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, pp. 5-8</ref>
