'''Silver pennies''' were a currency used in [[Bree]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]].

On the morning of [[30 September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> it was discovered that all of the ponies belonging to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], as well as every other horse stabled at [[the Prancing Pony]] had been stolen in the night.  Eventually [[Bill the Pony]] was bought from [[Bill Ferny]] for twelve silver pennies, which was considered to be at least three times its value.  [[Barliman Butterbur]] paid for the beast and also gave Merry eighteen more silver pennies in compensation for the ponies the party had lost.  The loss of thirty silver pennies was quite a financial blow to the innkeeper, even though he was reckoned well-off in [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>
