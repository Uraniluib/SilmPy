The '''House of the Golden Flower''' was an [[Eldar]]in noble House, one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondothlim|Twelve Houses]] of [[Gondolin]].  [[Glorfindel of Gondolin|Glorfindel]] was its lord,<ref>{{S|23}}.</ref> and its device was that of a rayed sun.<ref name=LT2III>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
==History==
When the forces of [[Angband]] [[Fall of Gondolin|attacked Gondolin]], the strength of the Golden Flower was in the [[Great Market]], on the east part of the city, where they were ambushed by a host of [[Orcs]] led by [[Balrogs]]. For hours they fought, until a [[Fire-drakes|Fire-drake]] came and killed many of them. There were only a few survivors, among them Glorfindel. 

The [[House of the Harp]] was sent to their aid, but its lord [[Salgant]] wished to betray them. However, the men of his house rebelled against him and they rushed to the aid of the Golden Flower, many of them being killed in that market. 

Eventually Balrogs and [[Dragons]] who reinforced [[Morgoth]]'s army breached the walls of Gondolin, and the House of the Golden Flower, along with the remaining houses, moved towards the [[Square of the King]]. Further on, many lost their lives holding the rear for those who retreated towards [[Idril's secret way]]. The few remaining members assisted helpless to their Lord's death during his fight with the Balrog.<ref name=LT2III/>
