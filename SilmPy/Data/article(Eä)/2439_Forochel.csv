'''Forochel''' was one of the regions of the [[Northern Waste]]. It was the name of the icy tundra in the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]], and especially of the great [[Icebay of Forochel|icebay]] and the lands that surrounded it.

Like the rest of the Northern Waste, the source of Forochel's everlasting cold was an after-effect of [[Morgoth]]'s [[Dor Daidelos|frigid land]] that once existed there in the [[Elder Days]]. Even after the fall of the first [[Dark Lord]] and his realm, the lands of the north retained their freezing temperatures.

It was inhabited by the [[Lossoth]], a hardy tribe of [[Men]] descended from the [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]]. Most Men of the region lived on the Cape of Forochel near the Great Sea of [[Belegaer]] but some built their villages on the shores of the Icebay itself.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]] and means "northern ice", composed of ''[[forod]]'' "north" and *''hel'', a possible Sindarin word meaning "ice" (cf. [[KHELEK]]<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://www.elfdict.com/w/Forochel|website=Parf Edhellen|articlename=Forochel}}</ref> and the struck-out [[Noldorin]] word ''hell'' "frost"<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 364 (root appearing as "KHEL-")</ref>).

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]:'''
:Forochel is one of the regions of the game, accessed via the northern end of [[Evendim]]. The language and culture of its people, the Lossoth, are modeled after the Finnish. An ''aurora borealis'' effect can be seen in the sky. Prior to the release of Western [[Gondor]], it was the only region in the game world where the ocean was visible, but players will freeze to death if attempting to swim in it.
