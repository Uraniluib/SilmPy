The '''King's House''' was a building in [[Osgiliath]] where the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] of [[Gondor]] and their families lived during the first part of the [[Third Age]]. After the abandonment of Osgiliath and the removal of the Kings to [[Minas Tirith]] in {{TA|1640}},<ref>{{App|B2}}, 1640</ref> the King's House was presumably no longer used.

Queen [[Ber√∫thiel]] was said to prefer the King's House to [[Tarannon Falastur|her husband]]'s residence by the [[Belegaer|Sea]] near [[Pelargir]]. While living there, she kept the inside bare and filled the courtyard with strange and frightening sculptures.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 7</ref>
