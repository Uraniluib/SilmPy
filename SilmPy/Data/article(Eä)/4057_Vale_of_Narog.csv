The '''Vale of Narog''' was the valley of the swift-running River [[Narog]] cut southwards through [[West Beleriand]] from the river's sources beneath [[Ered Wethrin]] in the north. For the first half of the river's journey, the Vale passed through the high moorlands west of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref> through lands that were ruled from [[Nargothrond]], and past the field of [[Tumhalad]] where Nargothrond's last battle was fought. 

As the river plunged into the rocky lands beneath [[Taur-en-Faroth]], its valley became much steeper and narrower, until the river emerged to flow across the lowlands of West Beleriand and ran on to meet [[Sirion]] at [[Nan-tathren]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>
