The '''Fall of Dol Guldur''' was an epic battle of the [[War of the Ring]], culminating the [[Rhovanion]] campaign.  The usual guardians, the [[Nazgûl]], were gone, and the forces from Dol Guldur had been defeated four times by the Elves of Lórien and Mirkwood.  


== The Battle and Aftermath ==

[[Celeborn]] led the assault on [[28 March|March 28]], and it was within a few days captured.  After the battle, [[Galadriel]] came and threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, cleansing the forest.

On [[6 April|April 6]] Celeborn and King [[Thranduil]] met in the midst of the forest and renamed it [[Eryn Lasgalen]] "wood of green leaves".  Celeborn took the land south of [[East Bight|The Narrows]] for himself and named it [[East Lórien]], while Thranduil took all wood north of the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]], and they gave the middle of the wood to the [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]].
