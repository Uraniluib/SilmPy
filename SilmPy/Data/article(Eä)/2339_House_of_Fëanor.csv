The '''House of Fëanor''' were the cursed descendants and followers of [[Fëanor]], the eldest son of [[Finwë]], and his spouse [[Nerdanel]]. Fëanor was one of the greatest, and certainly the most skilled, of the [[Noldor]], but his burning anger at the loss of his [[Silmarils]] led him to commit acts that would greatly diminish the influence of his house among his people. As the heir of Finwë, Fëanor and his descendants should have inherited the [[High King of the Noldor|High Kingship of the Noldor]], but because of Fëanor's rash acts, the lordship of the Noldor passed to his brothers: [[Finarfin]] in [[Aman]], and [[Fingolfin]] in [[Middle-earth]]. For this reason, the members of the House of Fëanor are referred to as the [[Dispossessed]].

The history of the House was a woeful one, and most of its members met an early end. Fëanor and six of his seven sons perished before the end of the First Age. His second son [[Maglor]] survived beyond the [[War of Wrath]], wandering the shores of Middle-earth, but his fate is unknown. The last of the House was Fëanor's grandson [[Celebrimbor]], the son of [[Curufin]], who had a great part in the making of the [[Rings of Power]], and was tortured to death by [[Sauron]] during the [[Second Age]].
