'''Half-elven''' ([[Sindarin]] singular '''Peredhel''', plural '''Peredhil'''), are the children of the union of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. Half-elven are not a distinct race ''per se''; rather, they were fertile offspring as the result of a union between Elves and Men. There are four recorded unions of the Eldar with the Edain. 

In the [[First Age]], Lúthien married Beren and Idril married Tuor.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref><ref name="Gondolin">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> These two lines of Peredhil were then joined by the marriage of Eärendil and Elwing. Eärendil and Elwing were the first to receive the choice of fates which passed to their line. Their sons, Elros and Elrond, chose different fates and the line was sundered until the end of the [[Third Age]].

In the end of the [[Third Age]], when Arwen Undómiel wed [[Aragorn|Aragorn II Elessar]],<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> a distant descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur, it united the long-sundered lines of those descended from both Elves and Men. There is also mention of an Elven bloodline in Prince [[Imrahil]]<ref name="Debate">{{RK|Debate}}</ref> via the old tale of [[Mithrellas]] and [[Imrazor|Imrâzor]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>{{rp|220-2}} 

==History==
[[Image:Jenny Dolfen - Descendants of Thingol.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''Descendants of Thingol'']]
The first bond between Elves and Men was the marriage of [[Beren Erchamion]] and [[Lúthien Tinúviel]], from which a single son, [[Dior Eluchíl]], was born. Dior Eluchíl wed [[Nimloth of Doriath]], and the two of them had three children: twin sons [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], and daughter [[Elwing|Elwing the White]]. Dior wore the Silmaril which passed to him from his mother, Lúthien, and this awakened the oath of the [[Fëanorians]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> Eluréd and Elurín were abandoned in the woods outside Doriath by the vengeful servants of Celegorm in retribution for their father's killing of their master; they were never found, even when [[Maedhros|Maedhros Fëanorion]] searched for them. 

The next bond came about through the union of [[Tuor]] son of [[Huor]] and [[Idril Celebrindal]], from which another son, [[Eärendil]], was born. Eärendil and Elwing begat another pair of twin sons: [[Elrond|Elrond Peredhel]] and [[Elros Tar-Minyatur]]. Elros chose the fate of Men, and  thus bore no more descendants bearing the title of "Half-Elven," but his brother Elrond chose the fate of Elven-kind.  

Elrond wed [[Celebrían]], daughter of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]], and bore three children: twin sons [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], and daughter [[Arwen Undómiel]]. Aragorn and Arwen were parents to a son, [[Eldarion]], as well as at least two daughters, thus leaving a remnant of the proud Elven lineage even after the Firstborn had long passed over the sea and out of time and memory. Though these children were long-lived, like Númenóreans had been and Eldarion ruled for at least 100 years,<ref>{{L|338}}</ref> they were mortal.   

Of the half-elves, Eärendil and Elwing were specifically given a choice in their fates when they journeyed to Valinor with a Silmaril to beg pardon for the [[Noldor]] and plead the plight of Elves and Men to the Valar. Only after that event was the choice passed to their children.<ref name="Voyage">{{S|Voyage}}</ref> The half-elven of this line were given a choice to be counted as one of the [[Eldar]] (Elves), thus being immortal, or one of the [[Edain]] (Men), thus being mortal. There is no evidence that any other mixed bloodline shared in that choice of fate. There is evidence that other, later half-elves did not as the children of Mithrellas, [[Galador]] and [[Gilmith]], were enobled but mortal like their father, as were their descendants.<ref name="Debate"/>

While Eärendil was truly half-elven, his Adan father, Tuor, had been granted the fate of the elder race.<ref name="Gondolin"/> Elwing and her father, Dior, were not truly half-elven as they were descendants of the divine bloodline of [[Melian]]. However, all three of them, Dior, Eärendil, and Elwing, bore a Silmaril, before the choice of fates, which was a hallowed jewel that would not have suffered the touch of mortals.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref> While the following specifically states: "in the dawn of years Elves and Men were allies and held themselves akin . . . and in the glory and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the offspring of elf and mortal, Eärendil, and Elwing, and Elrond their child," it does not necessarily exclude Elwing's father and brothers or Elrond's brother, Elros, prior to his choice.<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref>

It may have been Tolkien's intent that once the choice was decreed for the specific line of Eärendil and Elwing, any born after that time with mortal blood in their veins, would be mortal. In an older version of ''The Silmarillion'', when Manwë spoke his judgment to Eärendil, this line appeared: "now all those who have the blood of mortal Men, in whatever part, great or small, are mortal, unless other doom be granted to them."<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref> That part of the judgment did not appear in the 1977 edition. 

===The half-elven lines===
Those who through indirect textual evidence (sharing a divine heritage and/or handling the Silmaril unscathed) are counted among the Eldar are bold faced; those who chose to be counted as an Elda rather than an Adan are italicized; those who were counted among the Edain (or who had not made the choice either way) are not. Their actual mathematical descent from elves is in a fraction in parentheses.

The important members of the half-elven lines were:
* '''[[Dior]]''', son of Man [[Beren]] and Elf [[Lúthien]], grandson of the [[Maia]] [[Melian]]. (1/4)

* ''[[Eärendil]]'', son of the Man [[Tuor]] and Elf [[Idril]] (1/2)

Eärendil would rather have chosen the kindred of Men, but he chose the Elves for his wife Elwing's sake, who chose the Elves.<ref name="Voyage"/> Eärendil's fate was special; however, he was not allowed to stay in [[Valinor]], but had to sail the heavens in his ship [[Vingilótë]]. The [[Silmaril]] of Beren and Lúthien on was bound on his brow, to shine brightly as a sign of hope for [[Middle-earth]]. Elwing resided in a white tower built northward on the borders of the Sundering Sea and met him upon his return.<ref name="Voyage"/> 

* ''[[Elwing]]'', daughter of Dior and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]. (5/8)

Elwing's father, Dior, was the son of Beren and Lúthien, and he and his children with the Elf Nimloth of [[Doriath]]: Eluréd, Elurín, and Elwing were of the three-fold races: Edain, Eldar, and Maiar. Dior and his wife were slain in the [[Second Kinslaying]], Elwing escaped, and the fate of Eluréd and Elurín is not known.<ref name="Doriath">{{S|Doriath}}</ref> Elwing was given her choice of kindred and chose the Eldar. 

* '''[[Eluréd]]''' and '''[[Elurín]]''', sons of Dior and Nimloth. (5/8)

* ''[[Elrond]]'', son of Eärendil and Elwing. (9/16)

The heirs of Elrond, including Arwen Undómiel, also had the free choice of kindred, therefore Arwen could choose to be counted amongst the Edain even though her father had chosen to be counted as Elven. The heirs of Elros were not given this choice, but their lifespan was enhanced many times that of normal Men. In later times, the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] Kings, descendants of Elros, regretted their forefather's choice, and this helped lead to the downfall of Númenor. 

* [[Elros]], also son of Eärendil and Elwing. (9/16)

* [[Arwen]], daughter of Elrond and [[Celebrían]]. (25/32)

Arwen, daughter of Elrond, married [[Aragorn]], distant heir of Elros, and thus the two Half-elven lines were merged in the [[Fourth Age]]. Their son [[Eldarion]] and their daughters were not counted as Half-elven, but rather as [[Dúnedain]] restored.

* [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], sons of Elrond and Celebrían.  (25/32)

They were bound to not make their choice until their father had set out to depart from Middle-earth; the texts do not reveal their final choices. However, like Arwen, until the choice was made at the time of Elrond's departure, his children "shall live with the youth of the Eldar."<ref>{{App|A1v}}</ref>
