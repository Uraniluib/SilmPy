'''Enel''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈenel]}}) was the third of the three [[Elf-fathers]] who awoke at [[Cuiviénen]]. His spouse was [[Enelyë]].

He walked along with the other Fathers, [[Imin]] and [[Tata]], and took the third group of 24 Elves. They found other groups but because Imin refused to choose again, Enel also took the fifth group of 48 Elves.

He was the head of the Clan named after him [[Nelyar]], the "Thirds" who became known as [[Teleri]].<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 380-1</ref>
