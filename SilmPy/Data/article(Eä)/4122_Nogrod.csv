'''Nogrod''' was one of two [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] cities in the [[Ered Luin]] that prospered during the [[First Age]]. It was home to the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]].

==Description==
Nogrod lay in the north-central part of the mountain range, near [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] where the Dwarf-road of [[Beleriand]] crossed into [[Eriador]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> It guarded one of the only passes through the mountain range.<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("But the Dwarves had built some great Mansions in those mountains [the Ered Luin] (commanding the only passes)")</ref> It was home to the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]].  Nogrod was also the home to the great Dwarven smiths [[Gamil Zirak]] and [[Telchar]].<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref>

==History==
The city was built sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]] when the western [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke from beneath Mount Dolmed.<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("...which had certainly been founded long ago ... before the coming of the exiled Noldor, probably before the Eldar of the Great Journey ever reached Beleriand")</ref>

Nogrod traded with throughout Beleriand and the Dwarves were employed for delvings and crafts, most famously the [[Nauglamir]] for King [[Thingol]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> [[Eöl]] the Dark Elf often went there, as did his son [[Maeglin]].<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> 

At the end of the First Age, Nogrod was ruined in the [[War of Wrath]],<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> and around the [[Second Age 40|fortieth year]] of the [[Second Age]] the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began to migrate to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], abandoning Nogrod and [[Belegost]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterward.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}} p. 235</ref>

==Etymology==
Nogrod is a [[Sindarin]] name; it was originally known as '''Novrod''' which means "hollow delving" aka '''Hollowbold''', like its original Khuzdul name, '''Tumunzahar'''. 

Novrod was altered to ''Naug''rod under the influence of the similar-sounding word ''[[Naug]]'' "dwarf".<ref name=el/> Therefore while the name '''Hollowbold''' is provided as the translation of Nogrod<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> it is not a literal translation; the new name means rather "Dwarf dwelling".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Nogrod"</ref>

The second element of Novrod/Nogrod is Sindarin ''groth/grod'' meaning "delving, underground dwelling".<ref name=el>{{S|Elements}}</ref> 

In ''[[The Etymologies]]'' the name is labelled as [[Noldorin]] and is said to contain the element ''[[Naug]]'' "dwarf". The second element ''-rod'' is not explained, but a note by [[Christopher Tolkien]] points to entry [[ROD]], an etymological [[root]] meaning "cave". Relevant Noldorin words include ''rhond'' "cave" and ''rhaud'' "hollow, cavernous".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries NAUK, ROD</ref>

Its name in [[Khuzdul]] was ''[[Tumunzahar]]'' (meaning "Hollowbold"),<ref name="Sindar"/> and its [[Quenya]] name was ''Návarot''.<ref>{{WJ|AB}}, p. 389</ref>
