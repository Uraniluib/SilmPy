'''Túna''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtuːna]}}) was the green hill in [[Aman]], raised by the [[Valar]] within the [[Calacirya]]. The [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] founded their fair city of [[Tirion]]. In the [[Years of the Trees]] the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] fell upon its western face and its shadow lay ever to the east, reaching [[Eldamar]] and [[the Sea]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

When [[Eärendil]] came to Aman the people of the city had gone to a festival in [[Valimar]] so the city was empty. Fearing some evil had befallen the Blessed Realm he turned away until [[Eönwë]], the herald of [[Manwë]], called to him and invited him to Valimar.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

A host of [[Númenóreans]] camped around Túna when [[Ar-Pharazôn]] invaded Aman.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
