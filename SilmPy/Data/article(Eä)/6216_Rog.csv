'''Rog''' was the name of an [[Elf]]-lord of [[Gondolin]].<ref name="LT2">{{LT2|III}}, pp. 174-80</ref>

==History==
Rog was a blacksmith, and chief of the [[Folk of the Hammer of Wrath]].  He was considered the strongest of the [[Noldoli]], and was like considered third greatest in valour.  He led his people against the [[Balrogs]] and the [[Orcs]] during the [[Fall of Gondolin]] after the Gate was broken. Later during the battle he stirred his kindred against the Balrogs with words of passion, and though many were slain, they slew a number of the fiery creatures "that... was a marvel and dread to the hosts of [[Morgoth|Melko]], for ere that day never had any Balrogs been slain by the hand of Elves or Men".  But the House of the Hammer of Wrath were hemmed in, and every one of them perished, including Rog.<ref name="LT2"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Rog'', in earlier writings ''Rôg'', seems curious as a name for an elf-lord of Gondolin: no other one-syllable names appear in other writings.

The meaning or etymology of the name is unclear, but in the context of the later works, it means "demon" as an element in ''[[Balrog]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, RUK</ref><ref>{{WJ|P4}}, p. 415</ref> The [[Qenya]] form of his name was ''Rōka''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>
