'''Bralda-hîm''' ('Heady Ale') was the long river that flowed southward from [[Nenuial]] was called Baranduin by the [[Elves]], a name that meant approximately 'golden brown river'. When the [[Hobbits]] settled in [[the Shire]] during the [[Third Age]], a part of this river formed their new eastern border, and they took a name modelled on the original Elvish: [[Branda-nîn]], meaning 'border-water'. 

In the playful, punning character of the Hobbits, though, the river's name evolved over time to become Bralda-hîm, relating to its golden brown colour and meaning 'heady ale'. This later name became the ultimate source of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s anglicised version of the Hobbit-name, which is [[Brandywine]].
