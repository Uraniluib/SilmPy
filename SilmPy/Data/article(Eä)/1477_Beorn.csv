'''Beorn''' was a [[Skin-changers|Skin-changer]], a man who could assume the form of a [[bears|bear]]. 

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - At the Carrock.jpg|[[Jef Murray]] - ''At the Carrock''|thumb|left]]
His origins lay in the distant past, and [[Gandalf]] suspected he and his people had originally come from the mountains, until the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] drove them away. He lived with his tame [[horses]] in a wooden house ([[Beorn's Hall]]) between the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Mirkwood]], to the east of the [[Anduin|Great River]] of  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. 

Beorn named the [[Carrock]] and created the steps that led from its base to the flat top. Once Gandalf saw him as a bear sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and heard him growl in the tongue of bears "''The day will come when [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|they]] will perish and I shall go back!''". While Gandalf knew him, Beorn did not know Gandalf; but he knew his fellow wizard, [[Radagast]].<ref name=Queer/> 

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], Beorn received Gandalf, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the thirteen [[Dwarves]] and gave the Dwarves and Bilbo help in their quest.<ref name=Queer>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Beorn appeared transformed into a giant bear, rescued [[Thorin]] from the [[Orcs|Goblins]] and killed their leader, [[Bolg]].<ref name=H18>{{H|18}}</ref>

After Thorin's burial, Beorn followed Bilbo, Gandalf and [[Thranduil]] on their way back to the west. Beorn once more hosted Bilbo and Gandalf and other [[Woodmen]] who came to celebrate [[Yule]].<ref name=H18/>

Eventually, he became a "''great chief''" in the [[Vales of Anduin]], and it is said that his descendants also were skin-changers, able to take the shape of a bear.<ref name=H18/> His people became known as the [[Beornings]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref> and they helped defend [[Thranduil]]'s kingdom of northern Mirkwood.<ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>{{fact}} 

Beorn presumably died some time before the [[War of the Ring]] began<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> and was succeeded by his son [[Grimbeorn|Grimbeorn the Old]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Character==
Beorn was generally benevolent and hated goblins and wargs; but he was also a loner and distrustful of travelers and beggars. He was never polite, and became easily angry and appalling. He never invited people into his house and his very few friends, who lived a good way away, came no more than a couple to his house at a time. Added to this, Beorn was not fond of [[Dwarves]].

Although fierce to his enemies, once convinced of the others' goodwill, he was welcoming, generous and helpful.

He did not eat any meat, as he could talk with his animals, who helped him. His grove was occupied by huge [[bees]]. Beorn's diet was mainly honey and cream.

==Etymology==
''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beorn Beorn]'' is an [[Old English]] word meaning "a warrior, a hero, a man of valour" (also, poetic "man"), cognate to [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]] ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bj%C7%ABrn björn]'' ("bear").<ref name=AH164>{{HM|AH}}, pp. 164-5</ref><ref name=RW>{{HM|RW}}, pp. 95-6</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref> In the Scandinavian-speaking countries ''Björn''/''Bjørn'' is a personal name, attested since the 11th century.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name of the character that would become Beorn is ''Medwed''. Medwed's ability to change shape to a bear was due to an enchantment, perhaps of his own.<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}</ref> The similarity between ''Medwed'' and ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/medved Medved]'', the Russian word for "bear", is striking, but it is ultimately unknown if Tolkien had this in mind.

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Ilkorin]] ''[[ber]]'' ("valiant man, warrior") and [[Danian]] ''[[Beorn (Nandorin)|beorn]]'' ("man") derive from the [[Elvish]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[BER]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 352 (root BER-; cf. root [[BES|BES-]])</ref>

==Inspiration==
It has been suggested that the character Beorn was influenced by the Norse ''[[wikipedia:Hrólfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrólfr Kraki]]''.<ref name=RME73>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (second edition), pp. 73-4</ref> In the saga appears a great bear defending [[wikipedia:Hrólfr Kraki|Hrólfr Kraki]], and also a man cursed to being transformed into a bear during nighttime. The work was well-known to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as one of his students and friend, Stella Miller, made [[The Saga of Hrolf Kraki|a translation of the saga]] dedicated to Tolkien, [[E.V. Gordon]] and C.T. Onions;<ref name=AH164/> but even more importantly as Tolkien himself wrote an unpublished short story of the tale, entitled ''[[Sellic Spell]]''.<ref>{{HM|MB}}, pp. 256-60</ref>

Another suggested inspiration is the character of [[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]], "''whose name is commonly explained as Beowulf = 'bees' wolf' = honey-eater = bear, and one who breaks swords, rips off arms and cracks ribs with ursine power and clumsiness.''"<ref name=RME73/>
