'''Evernight''' was a dark, raging part of the ocean, through which [[Eärendil]] passed on his epic journey to [[Valinor]]. The name only appears in [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s '[[Song of Eärendil]]', making it hard to identify with certainty. From its context in the poem, though, it seems to be a reference to the [[Shadowy Seas]] that formed part of the defences of [[Aman]].
