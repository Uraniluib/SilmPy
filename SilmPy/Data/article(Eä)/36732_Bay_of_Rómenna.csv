The '''Bay of Rómenna''' was an inlet of [[Belegaer]] on the eastern side of [[Númenor]] that separated [[Orrostar]] to the north from [[Hyarrostar]] to the south.  The bay had a narrow opening where it met the ocean, widened in the middle, and narrowed again at the mouth of the [[Firth of Rómenna]].<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref>  Within the bay was a small isle called [[Tol Uinen]].  Prince [[Aldarion]] frequently anchored the ''[[Eämbar]]'' off of this island and lived aboard this ship due to [[Tar-Meneldur]]'s coolness to his son's nautical outlook.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
