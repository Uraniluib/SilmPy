'''''Nelyafinwë''''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌnɛʎaˈfinwɛ]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌnɛʎaˈɸinwɛ]}}) was the [[father-name]] of [[Maedhros]], eldest son of [[Fëanor]]. Formed by adding up the [[Quenya]] adjective ''[[nelya]]'', which means "third" to the name of his [[Finwë|grandfather]], it can be translated as "Third Finwë".<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod''</ref>  The name was not used in Middle-earth since the [[Noldor]] exiles spoke [[Sindarin]] there after Thingol's decree.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>
