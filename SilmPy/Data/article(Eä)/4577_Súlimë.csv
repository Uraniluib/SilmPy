'''Súlimë''' ([[Gwaeron]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the third month of the year in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]], and followed the month [[Nénimë]].  In the King's Reckoning it preceded the month [[Víressë]] while in the Stewards' Reckoning it preceded the feast-day of [[Tuilérë]].  In both calendars, ''Súlimë'' was 30 days long, lasting from the 62nd through the 91st days of the year. In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the last month of the year, preceding its [[Mettarë]].

''Súlimë'' in the Kings' and Stewards' Reckoning corresponded to [[Rethe]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[21 February]] through [[22 March]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
