'''Lord of Andúnië''' was a title of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] lords of the shoreland region of [[Andustar]] in western [[Númenor]] and ruled the city [[Andúnië]].<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref>

As rulers of one of the divisions of Númenor the Lords of Andúnië were members of the [[Council of the Sceptre]], and also were the highest lords of the Island and chief councellors of the [[Kings of Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 23</ref><ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Their symbol of office was a [[Sceptre of Annúminas|silver sceptre]] which was afterwards held by the [[Kings of Arnor]]. The Lords also had inherited the [[Ring of Barahir]] from the royal house<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref>, the [[Elendilmir]] from [[Silmariën]], and were given the [[Palantiri]] by the [[Elves]].
==History==
The fourth King of [[Númenor]], [[Tar-Elendil]], was the first King whose eldest child was a daughter. Silmariën, as a woman, could not receive the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] and the King created the title of the Lords of Andúnië in favor of her son, [[Valandil (Lord of Andúnië)|Valandil]].

In later times some of the Kings of Númenor would marry women from the royal line of the Lords of Andúnië. From these marriages came the Kings [[Ar-Sakalthôr]] and the wise King [[Tar-Palantir]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}</ref>

When the [[Shadow]] fell on the Kingdom, the Lords remained [[Faithful]] and became the leaders of the [[Elf-friends]], but still retained their office during those dark times until [[Ar-Pharazôn]] stripped Amandil from his offices for supporting the Faithful.<ref name="Akallabeth"/> Amandil's descendants would go on to found the Kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]].

A family of [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the [[Second Age]]. This family of [[Númenóreans]] were akin to the Lords of Andúnië, and thus related to [[Elendil]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>  After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they had been given the title ''Prince of Belfalas'' by [[Elendil]]<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> and their land, now a fief of [[Gondor]], was called [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas which was succeeded by the [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Princes of Dol Amroth]].
