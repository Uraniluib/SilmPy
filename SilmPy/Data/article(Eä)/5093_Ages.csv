{{History of Arda}}'''Ages''' are large spans of time in which the [[Wise]] and the loremasters divided the history of [[Arda]]. The division was made according to large historical events such as the overthrowing of a [[Dark Lord]].
==The Ages==
===[[First Age]]===
The First Age saw the ascent of the [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Men]] and their [[Wars of Beleriand|wars]] against [[Morgoth]]. It ended with the [[War of Wrath]] and the drowning of [[Beleriand]]. [[Morgoth]] was captured by the [[Valar]], ending centuries of dominion in Beleriand.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref><ref name=AB/>

===[[Second Age]]===
In the Second Age the [[Edain]] prospered in [[Númenor]], but [[Sauron]], a servant of Morgoth also came to dominate the [[Westlands]]. The [[Rings of Power]] were created as one of such attempts. Sauron's influence also caused the [[Drowning of Númenor]] and the [[Changing of the World]]. The Age ended with the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the defeat of [[Sauron]].<ref name=AB>{{App|B}}</ref><ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

===[[Third Age]]===
The Third Age saw the gradual fading of the Elves and also the rise of Sauron against the [[Realms in Exile|Númenorian kingdoms]], until he was defeated during the [[War of the Ring]]. The Age ended some years later with the departure of the [[White Ship]] from [[Mithlond]].<ref name=rings/><ref name=AB/>
===[[Fourth Age]]===
The Fourth Age was a time when the Elves faded while Dwarves, Men and [[Hobbits]] prospered and recovered after the fall of Sauron, until the [[Dominion of Men]].<ref name=AB/>

Tolkien said in a letter written in [[1958]] that he believed the Ages had quickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age/beginning of the Seventh. However he did not explain the criteria of why the Ages should be shortened.<ref name="Letter211">{{L|211}}</ref>
