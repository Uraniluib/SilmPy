'''Smoking''' was an activity or custom begun by the [[Hobbits]] (who referred to it as an 'art').  It consisted of inhaling the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb called ''[[Pipe-weed]]''.  

The [[Bree-hobbits|Hobbits of]] [[Bree]] claimed to be the first to have smoked the Pipe-weed, but the first who cultivated it was [[Tobold Hornblower]] of [[Longbottom]] of [[the Shire]], around the year {{SR|1070}}. Smoking had spread from the Hobbits to [[Dwarves]], [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]], and [[Wizards]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was an avid pipe smoker. He attributed his addiction to his childhood, when he watched Father [[Francis Xavier Morgan]] smoking his pipe in a specific location each time.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}</ref> 

People who had met Tolkien noticed that a pipe was almost always in his hand or mouth, often making difficult to understand his speech.<ref>''J.R.R. Tolkien Talks about the Discovery of Middle-earth, the Origins of Elvish'' by [[Richard Plotz]], in [[Seventeen]]</ref> In a [[The Man Who Understands Hobbits|1966 interview]], Tolkien said: "Every morning I wake up thinking, 'Good, another 24 hours of smoking'".<ref>Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, "The Man Who Understands Hobbits", ''The Daily Telegraph Magazine'' (22 March 1968)</ref>
