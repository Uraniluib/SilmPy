The '''Elves of Mirkwood''' were [[Silvan Elves]] that lived in the [[Woodland Realm]] of northern [[Mirkwood]], under the rule of [[Thranduil]].

==History==
During the [[First Age]], the [[Valar]] summoned the first [[Elves]] to move with them to [[Valinor]]. There were three hosts that first set out to answer the call of the Valar. Of these, the largest host was that of the [[Teleri]]. They advanced very slowly, and would often lose sight of the other two, smaller hosts.<ref name="S3">{{S|3}}</ref> There was a time, when they reached the river [[Anduin]], one smaller leader of that host, [[Lenwë]], wished to go no further, and he and his people began to live in the forests surrounding the Anduin Vale as the remaining Teleri continued their journey to [[Valinor]]. Their descendants were the Silvan elves of [[Lothlórien]] and Greenwood the Great.<ref name="S3"/>

===Second Age===
During the [[Second Age]], many [[Sindar]] survivors, who did not sail to the [[Valinor|West]], did not wish to stay with the [[Noldor]] in [[Lindon]] and be dominated by them.<ref name="UT6b"/> They travelled eastward from Lindon and eventually ended up in Greenwood the Great, where the Silvan Elves of [[Nandorin]] descent lived. The Silvan Elves were ''[[morbin]]'',<ref>{{WJ|B}} (pp. 376-7, 380)</ref> but they shared the same Telerin ancestry. The Sindar longed to experience a more "rustic" and "natural" way of life and fully embraced and adopted their culture and language. [[Oropher]], a Sinda, was taken by them as lord and founded the [[Woodland Realm]] in {{SA|750}} with the capital at [[Amon Lanc]].<ref>{{PM|Second}}, p. 174</ref><ref name="UT6b">{{UT|6b}}</ref> 

The Silvan Elves originally lived in the south of Greenwood, but over the course of the Age, [[Sauron]] came to [[Mordor]] and started building [[Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|1000}}<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}, note 14</ref> while the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves of Moria]] increased their power, and later, [[Galadriel]], who forsook [[Eregion]] due to the revolt of [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]],<ref name="UT6">{{UT|6}}</ref> followed by [[Celeborn]], who defended that realm until its fall, retreated to [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] with the refugees of that land.<!--How is this stuff about Galadriel relevant?-Mith--> The Silvan Elves across the Anduin gradually moved north to live around the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]].<ref name="UT6b">{{UT|6b}}</ref>

Oropher joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] by summoning a great army which joined with [[Amdír]]'s smaller force of [[Galadhrim|Lórien Elves]] to create one large host of Silvan Elves; the Silvan Elves were strong and brave, but they had poor armour and weapons in comparison with the [[Noldor]]. [[Amdír]] and Oropher were unwilling to submit to the supreme command of [[Gil-galad]], as such they suffered heavier losses in the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref name="UT6b"/> In the first assault upon [[Mordor]], Oropher and other brave and hasty Silvan Elves rushed forward before Gil-galad gave the signal to charge. Oropher charged to the fore of his men and was slain. 

Over the course of the war, which ended with the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|3441}}, two-thirds of the Silvan army had been lost. The remnants of the army returned to Greenwood under the command of Oropher's son, [[Thranduil]], and he was crowned king.<ref name="UT6b"/> 

===Third Age===
With the return of [[Sauron]] around {{TA|1050}} southern Greenwood became dangerous and was renamed [[Mirkwood]]. Creatures like great spiders came to dwell in Mirkwood and Thranduil's folk retreated to the north-eastern corner of Mirkwood, where they fortified themselves near the [[Forest River]].

One day in {{TA|2941}} Thranduil and some of his folk were feasting in the woods when they were repeatedly disturbed by [[Thorin and Company|a party]] of [[Dwarves]]. After the third disturbance the Elves captured them. [[Thorin]] their leader, was brought before Thranduil but did not reveal the reason for their journey through Mirkwood. However the prisoners escaped with the help of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], [[Bilbo Baggins]], who escaped captivity by using his magic [[The One Ring|ring]].

After the Dwarves' escape Thranduil sent out messengers, who soon told him about the death of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]. He knew about the treasures, which Smaug had hoarded, and so he set out towards the [[Lonely Mountain]] with a company of Elves with spears and bows. On the way they met messengers from [[Bard]] in [[Lake-town]] who was seeking aid for his destroyed town. After the Elves had given food to the Lake-men and had helped them to build shelters against the oncoming winter, they were very surprised when they found out that Thorin and his company had survived Smaug's attacks, had taken possession of the Lonely Mountain and its treasures and that Thorin Oakenshield had claimed the title [[King under the Mountain]].  

Bard demanded a part of the treasure for [[Dale]] and Lake-town, which Smaug had destroyed, as well as for himself because he had shot the dragon. When Thorin refused to give away parts of the treasure, Thranduil and Bard besieged the mountain and Thorin sent for aid from his cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]]. After a few days Dáin's host approached and fight seemed unavoidable. But in the night Bilbo brought the [[Arkenstone]], a great jewel that Thorin valued above all to him open to negotiations. The next morning Bard and Thranduil entered into negotiations with an angered Thorin, who agreed to pay 1/14 share of the treasure in exchange for the stone. The next day Dáin arrived with his forces and although Thranduil was reluctant to start a war over gold, the dwarves proceeded to attack. 

At the last moment, when the battle was almost joined between the two sides Gandalf intervened and revealed that while they were bickering amongst themselves, the [[Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] under [[Bolg]] were using the opportunity to march against them. They had been incited by Gandalf's earlier slaying of the [[Great Goblin]], but had now mobilized for a full-scale attack after hearing news of the death of the Dragon and the now relatively unguarded treasure hoard. The three commanders agreed that the Orcs were the enemies of all and previous grievances between them were put on hold in face of the greater threat. So the [[Battle of Five Armies]] began.

Thranduil's host was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and they were the first to charge. Many Elves were slain and things looked grim when the [[Eagles]] arrived on the battlefield. They turned the tide and the battle was won. The victors divided the treasure.

On [[21 March|March 21]], {{TA|3018}} [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] delivered [[Gollum]] as a prisoner to Thranduil. He was guarded day and night, but the Elves pitied him and allowed him to climb a tree that stood alone. When one night in June of 3018, Gollum refused to come down, the Elves were attacked by Orcs and Gollum could escape in the confusion. Thranduil sent his son [[Legolas]] to Rivendell to inform [[Elrond]], and in the [[Council of Elrond]] Legolas was selected as one of the nine members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

On [[15 March|March 15]], {{TA|3019}}, an army of [[Sauron]] from [[Dol Guldur]], tasked with destroying the Woodland Realm, attacked Mirkwood. There was a long [[Battle Under Trees]] and the woods were set on fire. But in the end Thranduil defeated the invaders. 

Because the Shadow over Mirkwood was lifted, Thranduil and Celeborn renamed it [[Eryn Lasgalen]], the Wood of Greenleaves. They divided it up, so that Thranduil received the northern part as far as the Mountains, and Celeborn took the southern part below the [[Narrows of the Forest|Narrows]], naming it [[East Lórien]]. The wide forest in-between was given to the [[Beornings]] and the [[Woodmen]]<ref name="AppB">{{App|B}}</ref>.

After the destruction of [[Dol Guldur]] and the cleansing of Mirkwood, Thranduil and the Wood-Elves remained untroubled for many years.

After the fall of Sauron, around {{FoA|20}},<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> Legolas brought south Elves out of Greenwood, and they dwelt in Ithilien, and it became once again the fairest country in all the westlands.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> They stayed in Ithilien for "a hundred years of Men."<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> Legolas and the Wood-Elves later worked together with Gimli and the Dwarves to rebuild and improve [[Minas Tirith]], capital city of [[Gondor]], the realm of their mutual friend King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]]<ref name="AppB"/>. After King Aragorn died, Legolas sailed West, reportedly taking Gimli with him, and with them left numerous other [[Elves]].<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref><ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Language==
It is unclear precisely what form of [[Sindarin]] and/or [[Silvan Elvish]] the Elves of Mirkwood spoke.

In "The Silvan Elves and Their Speech" Tolkien writes that, "Thranduil father of Legolas of the Nine Walkers was Sindarin, and that tongue was used in his house, though not by all his folk."<ref name="UT6a"/> This implies that Sindarin was the language of court and Silvan Elvish or the woodland tongue was the language of the people. It was later written that, "by the end of the Third Age the Silvan tongues had probably ceased to be spoken in the two regions that had importance at the time of the War of the Ring: Lórien and the realm of Thranduil in northern Mirkwood."<ref name="UT6a">{{UT|6a}}</ref> However, when Legolas related the song of Nimrodel, a song about a [[Third Age]] event, he said, "it is a fair song in our woodland tongue."<ref>{{FR|II6}} p. 330</ref><ref group="note">"Silvan Elvish is also referred to as the 'woodland tongue'." (J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment - Languages Invented by Tolkien - edited by Michael D. C. Drout, p. 339)</ref> 

In "The Sindarin Princes of the Silvan Elves", Tolkien states that:
 
{{blockquote|Oropher had come among them with only a handful of Sindar, and they were soon merged with the Silvan Elves, adopting their language and taking names of Silvan form and style. This they did deliberately; for they . . . came from Doriath after its ruin, and had no desire to leave [[Middle-earth]], nor to be merged with the other Sindar of Beleriand, dominated by the Noldorin Exiles for whom the folk of Doriath had no great love. They wished indeed to become Silvan folk . . .|{{UT|6b}}}}

In [[Letter 347]], written in [[1972]], there is a note which states: "The Silvan Elves of Thranduil's realm did not speak [[Sindarin|S.]] but a related language or dialect."<ref>{{L|347}}</ref> This could be a mixture of [[Doriathrin]], or Old Sindarin, mixing with the Silvan Elvish of the Nandor and Avari.<ref group="note">See [[David Salo]]'s ''[[A Gateway to Sindarin]]'' p. 13</ref>     

==Portrayal in adaptations==
*'''[[2013]]: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:[[Beorn]] says about these Elves that they are dangerous and less wise than their kindred. There seems to be a gap between the Sindar and the Silvan, as Thranduil disaproves Legolas's affection for [[Tauriel]].
