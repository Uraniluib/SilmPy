The '''War of the Elves and Sauron''' was a great war fought in the [[Second Age]].

== The Making of the Rings of Power ==
During the Second Age, [[Sauron]] planned to take control of the Elves through the power of his [[One Ring]]. In his guise as [[Annatar]], he instructed the [[Elves of Eregion]] in the making of [[Rings of Power]], and then secretly constructed a Ruling Ring of his own to enslave the bearers of the Rings. Unknown to him, the Elves had made [[Three Rings]] of their own, so that when Sauron took up his own Ring, they understood his intentions and his centuries of planning came to nothing.

== The War Begins ==
What he could not control by subtlety, Sauron resolved to destroy by force, and so began the War of the Elves and Sauron. At first, Sauron's victories came quickly: vast armies emerged from [[Mordor]] and, over the next six years, overran [[Eriador]]. Eregion was destroyed, and Sauron claimed the remaining Rings of Power (except for the Three Rings, which had been sent far from Eregion at the beginning of the war).

The Elves of Eregion did not stand alone against Sauron. From [[Lindon]], [[Gil-galad]] sent a force commanded by [[Elrond]] to lend them aid. Before Elrond could come to Eregion, the Dark Lord demanded that the Rings of Power be turned over to him, and when he was refused he brought his full force against Eregion. In {{SA|1697}}, [[Ost-in-Edhil]] fell, with [[Celebrimbor]] himself leading a last desperate defence on the steps of the Jewel-smiths' guild house. He was taken captive by the [[Orcs]], then shot through with Orc-arrows, and by some accounts, Sauron used Celebrimbor's body as a banner as he turned to face Elrond's army approaching from the north.

Sauron gathered up the Rings of Power that remained, and laid waste the land of Eregion, bringing an end to its people. The surviving Elves of Eregion seem to have scattered, as there are various accounts of their fates. Some fled northward to join Elrond's host, and that host was itself forced into retreat; some of these Elves of Eregion settled at [[Rivendell]] when Elrond founded it shortly afterwards. They were joined there by others of their kind who had escaped into the [[Rhovanion|Wild]], and only later found their way to safety. Many of these people seem to have later abandoned [[Middle-earth]] and sailed into the [[West]].

Still, other survivors escaped into [[Khazad-dûm]] and were granted passage by their friends the [[Dwarves]], coming eventually through the [[Misty Mountains|Mountains]] to the woodlands that would long afterwards be called [[Lórien]]. The [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] indeed did more than simply allow the Elves to pass through their mansions; they went out against Sauron's armies. It was through their aid that the beleaguered Elrond was able to escape into the north and thus save many of the Elves of Eregion. Once the Dwarves returned to Khazad-dûm, the [[Doors of Durin]] were shut and remained so until the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] came there thousands of years later.

Just as Sauron's victory looked secure, a great navy appeared in the north, carrying the forces of [[Númenor]] sent by [[Tar-Minastir|King Tar-Minastir]]. The [[Númenóreans]] put Sauron's armies to rout, and forced them back out of the [[Westlands]]. So Eriador was saved, but Celebrimbor's kingdom of Eregion had been wiped out, and a great many of the Rings of Power had fallen into the hands of Sauron.
