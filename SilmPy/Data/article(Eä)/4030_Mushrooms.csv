'''Mushrooms''' were an edible fungus. It is said that Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of [[Men|Big People]].<ref name="Cut"/>

==History==
Mushrooms were a particular delight of young [[Frodo Baggins]], who would often steal them from [[Farmer Maggot]]'s fields. Old Maggot still remembered it when Frodo came to his [[Bamfurlong|farm]] years later, and as a parting gift, [[Mrs. Maggot]] gave Frodo a basket of the prized mushrooms.<ref name="Cut">{{HM|FR}}, "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]"</ref> 

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] described himself as a Hobbit in all but size, noting that he was very fond of mushrooms.<ref name="L213">{{L|213}}</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a note discussing the [[Drúedain]], Tolkien made mention about the fungi in the [[First Age]]: they were generally considered ugly and dangerous by the [[Elves]] and most of the [[Edain]], and the less wise called them "ork-plants", believing them cursed and  blighted by [[Morgoth]]. The Eldar did not eat them and only a few Edain knew how to distinguish the edible ones and could eat them because of great hunger when lost in the wild. The Drúedain had a lore of plants and ate fungi with pleasure (to the astonishment of the other peoples), and they cultured their favorite ones. They passed this knowledge to the [[Haladin]] who ate them when guests out of courtesy, and resolved to them at need. Tolkien later discarded the note believing that this trait made the Drúedain "too like Hobbits".<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, n. 52</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

:Mushrooms can be grown by players who are famers by profession. Players who are cooks can make these into mushroom pie, fried mushroom and fried dace with mushrooms. These are foods for low leveled characters that can increase different traits.
