'''Cirth''' referred to the runic writing systems in [[Middle-earth]].  ''Cirth'' (singular [[certh]]) means "''runes''" in [[Sindarin]].  ''[[Certhas]]'' refers to a runic alphabet. The system was an ancient writing of the [[Elves]], and although they were later largely replaced by the [[Tengwar]] (which were enhanced and brought by [[Fëanor]]), they were adopted by [[Dwarves]] because its straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar.

==Structure==
The above table gives the most ancient known cirth<ref>{{HM|AE}}</ref> that would later give the [[Certhas Daeron]]. They had possibly different values at that time than the ones given here. 

The known ancient cirth don&rsquo;t cover all the sounds of Sindarin, since we are missing ''rh'', ''lh'', ''mh'', ''v'', ''y'', ''œ''. Perhaps they were used for the [[Old Sindarin]] tongue, and many of the above mentioned sounds indeed didn&rsquo;t exist in that language. However still frequent sounds ''w'' and ''a'' are missing. This indicates that some ancient, unknown cirth could have existed, but didn&rsquo;t make it to the later systems; a fuller table therefore can't be reconstructed.

As for the vowel usage, perhaps the certh for ''u'' possibly was used for ''w'' (like in early latin orthography). The certh for ''a'' can&rsquo;t be guessed, so maybe this sound was &ldquo;meant&rdquo; (like in some Quenya Tengwar Modes). More possibly it was one of the two cirth whose value can&rsquo;t be determined, or it was one of some other cirth that did not survive till the later Angerthas.

Long vowels were evidently indicated by doubling (cf. the known certh for long ''o'', <em style="font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;">n</em>, is a simplified form of <em style="font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;">bb</em>).

==History==
During the [[Chaining of Melkor]], the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] began developing an alphabet for their language. Its letters were entirely made for carving on wood, stone or metal, hence their angular forms and straight lines. These letters were named ''cirth'' (sing. ''certh'').

The assignment of values was unsystematic. The form of a certh was consisted of a stem and a branch. The branch was found usually on the right side of the stem, and sometimes on the left, but with no phonetic significance. Therefore <em style="font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;">3</em> would just be an alternative form of <em style="font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;">1</em>.

Certhas Daeron was created by [[Daeron]], the minstrel of king [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] and was later expanded into what was known as the [[Angerthas Daeron]]. 

By the [[Second Age]] the cirth were seldomly used. The [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]] used cirth as a "matter of lore" mainly for formal writing. It was how the [[Dwarves of Moria]] got to know them and preferred them from the tengwar, being intended for carved inscriptions.<ref group=note>The text connects the lore usage of the cirth by the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] with the notion that [[Celebrimbor]] was a descendant of Daeron, before it was decided to make him the son of [[Curufin]].</ref> They modifed the system accordngly for their Khuzdul language (cf. ''[[Angerthas Moria]]'' and ''[[Angerthas Erebor]]'').

By the [[Third Age]] only some Elves of [[Sindar]]in descent wrote in cirth in inscriptions, even though with spelling influence from the [[tengwar]]. The [[Longbeards]] were of the very few peoples who still knew and used cirth, leading to the misconception that they invented them, and were known as "dwarf-letters" by outsiders.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>


==Inspiration==
Many letters have shapes also found in the historical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark Futhark], but their sound values are only similar in a few of the vowels. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes (e.g. ''p'' &#5832;  and ''w'' &#5817; as variants of ''b'' &#5842;), but is in any case much more obscure.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tolkien had noted an apparent discrepancy between [[Elrond]]'s reference to the Runes (actually the [[Moon-letters]]) as invented by the Dwarves; and [[Appendix E]], stating that they were invented by the [[Sindar]] in [[Beleriand]]. He attempted to resolve the discrepancy by making the Dwarves inventing them, and Daeron organizing them, or makng [[Angerthas Moria]] a purely Dwarvish invention. With a relief he decided that Elrond referred only to the Moon-letters and not the alphabetic system itself. [[Christopher Tolkien]] cites this incident as an example of how he strived for consistency for his [[Secondary world]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #8</ref>

==Encoding==
The Cirth are not part of the Unicode Standard. However the ConScript Unicode Registry has defined the U+E080&ndash;E0FF range of the Unicode "Private Use Area" for Cirth.
