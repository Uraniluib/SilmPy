The '''Battle of Greenfields''' or '''Battle of the Green Fields'''<ref name="Party">{{H|1}}</ref> was the first battle fought in [[the Shire]], and the only one until the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> 

==History==
===Prelude===
The Shire was generally untroubled by any harm for the first 1140 years of its history. [[Eriador]] was quiet until {{TA|2740}}, when [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] invaded several parts of Eriador.<ref name="AppB">{{App|TA}}</ref>

The [[Rangers of the North]] fought many battles trying to hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire.

===The Battle===
Seven years after the start of the unrest, a band of Orcs of [[Mount Gram]], led by their king [[Golfimbul]], entered the [[Northfarthing]].<ref name="Scouring"/> [[Bandobras Took]], who was living in [[Long Cleeve]], crossed the river [[Norbourn]] to engage them in the region known as Greenfields, between the Norbourn and the [[Brandywine]].<ref name="Index">{{HM|UI}}, p. 24</ref> Large enough to ride a horse, Bandobras charged the helm of the Orc-band and knocked Golfimbul's head off with his club. The head landed in a [[Rabbits|rabbit]]-hole a hundred yards away.<ref name="Party"/> Dismayed by his death, the orcs fled.<ref name="Concerning">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
With the rout of the orcs and the death of their king, their short uprisings within Eriador ceased, and eventually their attacks on the region stopped altogether.<ref name="Index"/> The Shire, and Eriador as a whole, would not suffer from any more invasions until the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Scouring"/>

Bandobras became a hero of Hobbit legend for his feat of arms, and was regarded in [[the Shire]] as one of the greatest Hobbits in history. According to Hobbit folklore, when Golfimbul's head landed in the rabbit-hole, Bandobras invented the game of [[golf]].<ref name="Party"/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first phase of ''The Hobbit'', the battle was called the '''Battle of the Green Fields of Fellin''', and the goblin king was called "[[Fingolfin]]". In addition to golf, chess was also invented, because the battle was won by "checkmate".<ref name="Pryftan">{{HH|Pryftan}}</ref> The reference to chess was likely removed because it was a philologist's joke that would have gone over too many heads: "checkmate" comes from Persian ''shah mat'', "the King is Dead".<ref>"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=checkmate Checkmate]", [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php Etymonline.com]</ref> 

The name "Battle of the Green Fields" first arose in the second phase. The reference to chess was removed at this stage.<ref name="Bladorthin">{{HH|Bladorthin}}</ref>
