}}'''Rúmil''' was a [[Lambengolmor|Lambengolmo]] ("Loremaster") of the [[Noldor]], living in the city of [[Tirion]]. 

==History==
Rúmil was notable for inventing writing. His alphabet was called ''[[Sarati]]'', as each letter was called a ''sarat''. This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by [[Fëanor]] as the [[Tengwar]]. He was also a skilled linguist, and when the [[Teleri]] finally arrived in [[Valinor]] he was first to discover just how the [[Telerin]] language differed from [[Common Eldarin]] compared to [[Quenya]].

It is assumed that Rúmil was one of the Noldor who refused the summons of [[Fëanor]], because he stopped writing his part of [[Annals of Valinor]] with the return to Valinor of those Noldor, led by [[Finarfin]].<ref>{{LR|AV}}</ref>.

==Works==
Rúmil was said to be the author of various works, some of which would find [[The Silmarillion|great acknowledgment]] after they were translated into [[Westron]] by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. These include:
* ''[[Ainulindalë]]''
* ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]''
* ''[[Lhammas]]''
* ''[[Lhammasethen]]''
* ''[[Ambarkanta]]''
* ''[[i Equessi Rumilo]]''

[[Pengolodh]] of [[Gondolin]], when arrived to Valinor, later continued and completed much of his work.

==Etymology==
The only thing known about the name ''Rúmil'' is that it is [[Quenya]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 51, 54</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', an Elf of [[Tol Eressea]] named Rúmil narrates to [[Eriol]] the creation of [[Arda]] by [[Ilúvatar]] and the [[Ainur]]; this mirrors Rúmil's connection to the ''Ainulindale'' tale.
