The '''Moors of the Nibin-noeg''' were high uplands that rose between the [[Vales of Sirion]] and the [[Narog]], northeast of [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, note 16</ref>  On the eastern side rose prominence of [[Amon Rûdh]].  The moor was covered in thickets of ''[[aeglos (plant)|aeglos]]''.<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 128</ref>

The moorlands were associated with the [[Nibin-noeg]] because in ancient times they had been part of their lands. Nargothrond to the west had originally been delved by the Nibin-noeg,<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 121</ref> as had the chambers at the top of Amon Rûdh, known by the Petty-dwarves as ''[[Sharbhund]]'' before the coming of the Elves.<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 128</ref>

In the [[The Second 'Silmarillion' Map|Second 'Silmarillion' Map]] the Moors were named '''Moors of the Neweglu'''.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 182 [F 6-7], 187 (note 26).</ref> The name ''[[Neweglu]]'' does not appear elsewhere, but it is close to the name ''Neweg, [[Neweglîn]]'', one of the names of the Petty-dwarves found in the ''Narn'' papers.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 187 (note 26).</ref>
