{{quote|...Morwen sent Túrin forth with two aged servants, bidding them find entry, if they could, into the kingdom of Doriath.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', "Of Túrin Turambar"}}

'''Gethron''', like [[Grithnir]], had been young at the time of [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]], when they had roamed far and wide throughout [[Beleriand]]. 

In their old age, they remained in the service of the [[House of Hador]], whose lord at that time was Hador's grandson [[Húrin]]. After Húrin failed to return from the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], his wife [[Morwen]] chose Gethron and Grithnir as guides for the young [[Túrin]], to lead him out of the now dangerous land of [[Dor-lómin]]. It was Gethron who stood before Thingol in the halls of [[Menegroth]] and asked that Túrin be fostered by the King, so playing a small part in Turin's deadly fate.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
These two "aged servants" are never named in [[The Silmarillion]], but their names are given in ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]''.
