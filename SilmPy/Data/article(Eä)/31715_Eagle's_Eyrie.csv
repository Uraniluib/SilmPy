The '''Eagle's Eyrie''' was a home of the [[Eagles]] located on the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Pan"/> Its exact location is unknown, however it is presumably close to the [[High Pass]] and [[Goblin-town]]. It was from this location that the Eagles helped the [[Elves]] of [[Rivendell]] keep watch over the lands east of the Misty Mountains, gathering information about the [[Orcs]] in the region.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the eagles of the eyrie rescued [[Thorin and Company]] from the tops of the trees at the Warg's clearing and took them to the Eagle's Eyrie. Here they met the [[Great Eagle]], ate their first food since escaping the Goblins, and spent the night.<ref name="Pan"/> The next morning the eagles took the company from the Eyrie to the [[Carrock]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>
