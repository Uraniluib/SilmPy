'''Ringarë''' was the last month of the year according to the [[Kings' Reckoning|Kings']] and [[Stewards' Reckoning]] of [[Gondor]], and the ninth month according to the [[New Reckoning]]. Ringarë in the Kings' and Stewards' Reckoning corresponded to [[Foreyule]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[21 November]] through [[20 December]]). The [[Sindarin]] name was [[Girithron]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word obviously contains the word ''ringa'' "cold". [[David Salo]] notes that the ending might be also seen in the abstract nouns ''almare'' "blessedness" and ''fanyare'' "the skies". Therefore the meaning of ''Ringare'' is equivalent to "*coldness".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36340;_ylc=X3oDMTM2Y2xrNnQwBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzExMDg5ODcEZ3Jwc3BJZAMxNzA1MDE5ODQ0BG1zZ0lkAzM2MzQwBHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTM0NTY4NjQ5MgR0cGNJZAMzNjM0MA--|website=[[Elfling]]|articlename=queren, ringare}}</ref>
