'''Othrondir''' was a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] man, who lived at the end of the first / beginning of the second century of the Fourth Age, probably in [[Emyn Arnen]]. He was an acquaintace of [[Borlas]] of [[Pen-arduin]], whom he had mentioned about rumours concerning some restlesness in Gondor. He also told about "canker", evidently referring to secret followers of the "old Evil" that was rising again in the Fourth Age.<ref>{{PM|XVI}}, p. 417.</ref> under the leadership of some [[Herumor (The New Shadow)|Herumor]].<ref>{{PM|XVI}}, p. 414.</ref>

The name was ''Othrondor'' in the first manuscript (ms. A) of the story, changed to ''Othrondir'' in the following manuscripts (mss. B and C).<ref>{{PM|XVI}}, p. 421, fn. 16.</ref>
