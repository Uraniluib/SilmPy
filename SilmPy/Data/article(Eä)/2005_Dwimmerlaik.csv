'''Dwimmerlaik''' was a name given to [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] by [[Éowyn]] (as [[Dernhelm]]) when she confronted him during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> 

By extension, it is possible that ''Dwimmerlaik'' is how the [[Rohirrim]] called the [[Wraiths]] or rumors of the [[Nazgûl]] in general.<ref>[[David Day]], ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]''</ref>
==Etymology==

The word ''dwimmerlaik'' is said to mean "work of necromancy, [[spectres|spectre]]" in the [[Rohirric|language of Rohan]].<ref>{{HM|LRI}}</ref>

[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have suggested that ''dwimmerlaik'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''dweomer'', [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:gedwimor|(gwe)dwimor]]'', ''-er''  ("illusion, phantom") + Middle English ''-layk'', ''-laik'' ("play").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 562</ref> See also ''[[Dwimordene]]'', ''[[Dwimorberg]]''.

It is not clear if the word refers to a generic creature of the Rohanese folklore (like the [[holbytla|holbytlan]]), specifically a [[phantoms|phantom]]; therefore when Éowyn confronted the Witch-King she likely rather identified him with one, than coining the word on that moment.

[[David Day]] in ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' considered that a Dwimmerlaik is any creature of Rohanese superstitious folklore that includes [[Elves]] and [[Ents]]. However, other than the appearance of the root ''dwimor-'' to describe [[Lothlórien]], there is no indication in Tolkien's writings that the word pre-existed or that it was used for other races.<ref>http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/DayBooks.html</ref>
