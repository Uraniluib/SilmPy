'''Gelmir''', son of [[Guilin]] and brother of [[Gwindor]], was a [[Elves of Nargothrond|noble Elf]] of [[Nargothrond]]. He was captured by [[Morgoth]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and as a captive was tortured and blinded. 

Years later, he was taken at the fortress of [[Barad Eithel]], where he was maimed and executed before the [[Elves|elven]] host. It was this sight that made Gwindor charge, beginning the great battle of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
