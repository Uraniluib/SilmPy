'''Folca''' ({{TA|2804}} – {{TA|2864}}, aged 60 years) was the thirteenth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Folca was the son of King [[Walda]], born in a time when his country was still plagued by the [[Orcs]] who invaded Rohan after the [[War of Dwarves and Orcs]] and his father died at their hands.

A great hunter, he famously cleared Rohan of the scourge of the Orcs to avenge his father.

He rode to hunt the monstrous [[Boar of Everholt]], but suffered a mortal wound from the beast's tusks. He was succeeded by his son [[Folcwine]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Folca is a name that means "of the folk" in [[Old English]].
