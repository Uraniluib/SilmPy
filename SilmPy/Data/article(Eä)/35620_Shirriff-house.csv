When [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] took control of [[the Shire]] and expanded the [[Watch]], the [[Shirriffs]] used crude buildings as '''Shirriff-houses'''. 

At the west end of [[Frogmorton]] was a poorly constructed one-story brick building with narrow windows, which served as the barracks of the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref> 

All the Shirriff-houses were torn down before the end of {{TA|3019}} ({{SR|1419}}).<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
