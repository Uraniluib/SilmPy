'''Shadowy Spring''' was located in [[Ered Gorgoroth]], between the [[Pass of Aglon]] and [[Dorthonion]]. It was the shared source of the rivers [[Esgalduin]] and [[Aros]] which marked the realm of [[Doriath]]. 

On the [[Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North|map accompanying]] ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] portrayed the spring of the two rivers as being separate, despite the rivers sharing a common spring on that map which he based his version on,<ref>{{LR|A3}} p. 409</ref> and on a commentary to the [[The First 'Silmarillion' Map (map)|first Silmarillion map]] by his father he admits his portrayal on the published Silmarillion map to be in error.<ref>{{SM|North}} p. 222</ref>
