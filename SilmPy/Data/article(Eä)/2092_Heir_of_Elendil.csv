'''Heir of Elendil''' was a title granted to those descended from [[Elendil]], the founder of the [[Two Kingdoms]] in the late years of the [[Second Age]]. In the North-kingdom of [[Arnor]], whose rulers were descended through Elendil's elder son [[Isildur]], its definition was simple: their rulers came from Elendil's direct male line, unbroken down to [[Aragorn]] himself. 

The political situation in the South-kingdom of Gondor was more complicated, because its first independent King, [[Meneldil]], was not a direct heir of Elendil in the strictest sense, being the son of Isildur's younger brother [[Anárion son of Elendil|Anárion]]. In [[Gondor]], therefore, the title was taken to refer to any descendants of Elendil who ruled in their own stead, a convenience that allowed Gondor's Kings to represent themselves as true Heirs of Elendil. This situation was complicated still further with the loss of Gondor's last King, [[Eärnur]]. After this point, the [[:Category:Stewards|Stewards]] who took up the rule of Gondor acted in place of the heirs of Elendil, and took on the powers associated with the title. 

These complexities were resolved at the end of the [[Third Age]] with the enthronement of [[Aragorn Elessar]], a true heir, as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of Arnor and Gondor.
