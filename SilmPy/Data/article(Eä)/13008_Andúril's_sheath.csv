Before the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] left [[Lothlórien]], [[Galadriel]] presented each of them with gifts. The first gift was given to [[Aragorn]]. It was a sheath made for his sword [[Andúril]]. The sheath was "overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven-runes formed of many gems the name Andúril and the lineage of the sword." Galadriel told that "the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat."<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>
