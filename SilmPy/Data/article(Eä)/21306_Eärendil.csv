'''Eärendil the Mariner''' ([[Quenya|Q]] "sea-friend", pron. {{IPA|[ˌe.aˈrendil]}}) was one of the [[Peredhil]] ([[Sindarin|S]] "Half-elven"), and an important figure in the legends of the [[Elder Days]]. Descended from all the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]], he was the first known person to reach [[Aman]] in the [[First Age]]. He was crucial in the [[War of Wrath]] and the patriarch of the line of the [[Kings of Númenor]] through his son [[Elros]]. 

== History ==
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Travelling South.jpg|thumb|left|Šárka Škorpíková - ''Travelling South'']]The son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], daughter of King [[Turgon]], Eärendil was raised as a child in [[Gondolin]]. Eärendil was seven years old when [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin fell]], and narrowly escaped death at the hands of his kinsman [[Maeglin]] during the battle. He was borne out on the shoulders of Idril's house-carle [[Hendor]]. As they rested in [[Tasarinan]], the waters of [[Ulmo]] awoke the [[sea-longing]] in both father and son.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>

He lived afterwards in [[Arvernien]] by the [[Havens of Sirion]]. Eärendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married [[Elwing]], daughter of [[Dior]] the son of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]. They had two sons, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]].

With the aid of [[Círdan]] the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, ''[[Vingilótë]]'' (or ''Vingilot''), and sailed around the seas west of Middle-earth, leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the [[Silmaril]] that Beren had wrested from [[Morgoth]]. News of this came to the sons of [[Fëanor]] that were still living, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, and slew most of them. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the Silmaril into the sea. The Silmaril was not lost, however:
[[File:Steamey - Eärendil and Elwing.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''Eärendil and Elwing'']]
{{quote|For [[Ulmo]] bore up Elwing out of the waves, and he gave her the likeness of a great white bird, and upon her breast there shone as a star the Silmaril, as she flew over the water to seek Eärendil her beloved. On a time of night Eärendil at the helm of his ship saw her come towards him, as a white cloud exceeding swift beneath the moon, as a star over the sea moving in strange courses, a pale flame on wings of storm. And it is sung that she fell from the air upon the timbers of Vingilot, in a swoon, nigh unto death for the urgency of her speed, and Eärendil took her to his bosom; but in the morning with marveling eyes he beheld his wife in her own form beside him with her hair upon his face, and she slept.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath"|}}

Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after [[Valinor]], and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the [[Valar]], and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in Middle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.

Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, [[Manwë]] forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due; and because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the [[Half-elven]]). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.

{{quote|But when all was spoken, Manwë gave judgement, and he said: 'In this matter the power of doom is given to me. The peril that he ventured for love of the Two Kindreds shall not fall upon Eärendil, nor shall it fall upon Elwing his wife, who entered into peril for love of him; but they shall not walk again ever among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands. And this is my decree concerning them: to Eärendil and to Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which kindred they shall be judged.'.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath"|}}

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons'']]
The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth, and overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. Eärendil took part in the battle, his ship Vingilótë was blessed by the Valar, and filled with a shining white flame and sent to the skies. He sailed at its helm with the Silmaril bound upon his brow. Alongside [[Thorondor]] and the [[Eagles]], Eärendil the Mariner slew the great dragon [[Ancalagon]] and cast it down onto [[Thangorodrim]], the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the [[War of Wrath]], led to the Ruin of [[Beleriand]].

Eärendil lived on in Valinor and the gleaming of the Silmaril upon his brow could still be seen in the skies of the distant West as the bright Evening Star.<ref name="S24">{{S|24}}</ref> Those who remained in Middle-earth called it '''Gil-Estel''' ([[Sindarin|S]] "Star of High Hope").

In the [[Second Age]], the descendants of the [[Edain]] followed the [[Star of Eärendil]] to reach [[Elenna]]. When [[Númenor]] fell under the [[Shadow]], [[Tar-Atanamir]] mentioned Eärendil's fate to argue about [[immortality]] to the [[Messengers]] of the [[Valar]]; the Messengers responded that his was a fate apart as a Half-elven, and he was bound to the sky, unable to return, whereas the [[Númenóreans]] demanded the liberties of both Elves and Men.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

[[Bilbo Baggins]] wrote the ''[[Song of Eärendil]]''<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> and the legend of Eärendil also inspired the poem ''[[Errantry]]''.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

== Names and Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Earendil.mp3|Ardamir}}
Eärendil was known by many epithets: Eärendil Halfelven<ref>{{S|23}}</ref>, Eärendil [[the Blessed]]<ref>{{S|17}}</ref><ref>{{S|IV}}</ref>, Bright Eärendil<ref name="S24"/><ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>, and Eärendil the Mariner<ref name="S24"/><ref>{{S|V}}</ref>. 

''Eärendil'' was his given [[father-name]]. His [[mother-name]] was ''[[Ardamir Eärendil|Ardamírë]]''. ''Eärendil'' is a [[Quenya]] name, meaning "Devoted to the Sea", literaly "Sea lover" (''[[eär]]'' + ''[[-ndil]]'').<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref><ref>{{PM|XI}}: ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>

Although these Quenya names were not given [[Sindarin]] forms in the [[legendarium]], experimental [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] forms, such as ''Aerendil'' and ''Aerennel'', were used by Tolkien in certain manuscripts.<ref>{{PM|XI}}: Note 52</ref>

Eärendil was translated as [[Azrubêl]] in [[Adûnaic]].

== Inspiration ==
[[Image:J.R.R._Tolkien_-_Earendil's_Heraldic_Device.JPG|right|thumb|100px|One of the two Heraldic Devices [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] designed for the House of Eärendil]]
While ''Eärendil'' is a [[Quenya]] name inside the [[legendarium]], Tolkien created the name based on [[Old English]] literature. Tolkien himself stated that the name was derived from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''éarendel''.<ref>{{L|297}}</ref> He says that he was struck by the "great beauty" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as "entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language."

There is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled ''The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star''.<ref>{{LT2|V}}, pp. 267–9</ref> Tolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse ''Aurvandill'', Lombardic ''Auriwandalo''), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]''.<ref>{{SD|Notion}}</ref> The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in ''Crist'' christianized to refer to John the Baptist).

Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in ''[[Wikipedia:Christ I|Christ]]'':

<blockquote>''éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended''<br>
"Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / sent over Middle-earth to men."</blockquote>

which can be taken as the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien's work, but also for the term [[Middle-earth]] (translating ''Middangeard'') for the inhabitable lands.

The first line is paralleled by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s exclamation in [[Shelob's Lair]], ''"[[Aiya]] Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!"''<ref>{{TT|IV9}}</ref> which is in [[Quenya]] and translates as "Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!". Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the "[[Phial of Galadriel|Star-glass]]" he carried, which contained the light of Eärendil's star, the [[Silmaril]].
