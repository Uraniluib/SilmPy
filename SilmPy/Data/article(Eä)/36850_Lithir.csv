The '''Lithir''' River<ref>{{WJ|11}}, p. 182</ref> was a tributary of the [[Sirion]] in [[Beleriand]] in the [[First Age]].  Its source was in the [[Ered Wethrin]] south of [[Mithrim]].  It flowed southeast until it raced over falls and joined the [[Sirion]] about halfway between [[Tol Sirion]] and the [[Dry River]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

When [[HÃºrin]] left [[Hithlum]], [[Asgon]] guided him over the mountains and down the course of the Lithir to reach the vale of Sirion.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 261</ref>
