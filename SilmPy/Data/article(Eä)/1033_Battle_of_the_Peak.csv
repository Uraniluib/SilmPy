The '''Battle of the Peak''' was [[Gandalf|Gandalf's]] name for his climactic battle with the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] known as [[Durin's Bane]], on the peak of the mountain called [[Celebdil|Silvertine]].

Gandalf pursued the Balrog from the depths of [[Moria]].<ref name="White">{{TT|III5}}</ref> On the peak they fought for two days and nights from [[23 January|23]] to [[25 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> During the battle, [[Durin's Tower]] was destroyed and the entrance to the [[Endless Stair]] was blocked. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and it broke the mountain-side as it fell. Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to [[Middle-earth]] with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.<ref name="White"/>
