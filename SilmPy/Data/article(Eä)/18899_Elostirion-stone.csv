The '''Palantír of Elostirion''', also known as the '''Elendil Stone''' was one of the [[Palantíri]] brought by the [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]]. 

It was stored in the tower [[Elostirion]] on the [[Emyn Beraid]] by [[Elendil]], and in later years was guarded by [[Círdan]] and the [[Elves]] of [[Lindon]].{{fact}}

The stone was aligned westwards towards the [[Master-stone]] in the [[Tower of Avallonë]], along the length of the [[Straight Road]]; because of this, it could not communicate with the other six of [[Middle-earth]]. Only Elendil was able to use it to look west across the [[Belegaer|Sea]] and see the [[Undying Lands]];<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>  Elendil also tried to see the fallen Númenor with the stone but failed.

Even after the fall of [[Arnor]], [[Wandering Companies]] of Elves made pilgrimages to visit the Towers and see the Stone, in order to catch a glimpse of [[Varda]]. One such company, led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] just returning from Elostirion, was encountered by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] on [[24 September|September 24]], {{TA|3018}}.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

It remained in its tower until the end of the [[Third Age]]; it was then taken back into the West aboard the [[White Ship]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>
