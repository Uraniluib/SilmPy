The '''White Horse''', on a field of green, was the emblem of the land of [[Rohan]] and its Kings. It was emblazoned on many of the arms of the [[Rohirrim]], as shown, for example, by the shield given to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] by [[Éowyn]], which bore the mark of the horse. As the royal banner of Rohan, it was borne to many battles. [[Théoden]] rode under it to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], and it was flown by [[Éomer]] before the [[Gate of Mordor]] itself. It was carried into battle by [[Éomer]] in the southern lands long after the [[War of the Ring]] ended.
==Inspiration==
According to [[Tom Shippey]]'s ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', the emblem may have been inspired from the [[Wikipedia:Uffington White Horse|Uffington White Horse]].

The White Horse is a recurring motif in mythology and prehistoric English culture. See [[Wikipedia:Leucippotomy|leucippotomy]].
