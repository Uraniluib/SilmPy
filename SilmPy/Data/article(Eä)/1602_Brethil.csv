'''Brethil''', later called '''''Sarch nia Chîn Húrin''''', was a forest between the [[Taeglin]] and the [[Sirion]], originally part of [[Doriath]] but outside the [[Girdle of Melian]]. The main feature of the forest was the hill of [[Amon Obel]].
==History==
After dwelling east of the river [[Gelion]], the [[Men]] of the [[House of Haleth]] were granted Brethil by King [[Thingol]], on the condition that they guard the [[Crossings of the Taeglin]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> Some [[Drúedain]] also dwelt there.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> The main settlement of the Haladin was [[Ephel Brandir]] on Amon Obel. 

The [[Men of Brethil]] for a century protected [[Nargothrond]] and also took part in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where they were all slain. Their [[Chieftain of the Haladin|Chieftain]] [[Handir]] was slain by Orcs north of Brethil on {{FA|495}}.<ref name=T>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

Túrin came here after the destruction of [[Nargothrond]] and the journey to [[Dor-Lómin]], and rested here for a while, until rumours came again about [[Glaurung]], the father of all dragons. At the borders of this forest Glaurung was slain by Túrin.<ref name=T/>

After the death of the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] his slayer Túrin wrenched his sword [[Gurthang]] from the belly of the beast. This action caused a spurt of black venomous blood to drench Túrin's hand.  The pain of his burned hand and a baleful glare by the dragon caused Túrin to swoon and appear as if dead. Soon after [[Nienor]], still under the dragon's curse and unaware of her true name, came to the scene and bound her husband Túrin's hand. She cried for him to awake but this only aroused Glaurung one last time. He hailed her by her true name and as he died she recalled all of her past. Niënor was horrified for she carried within her womb her brother's child. Brandir witnessed the scene and cried out to Niënor, but she fled and jumped to her death at the [[Cabed-en-Aras]]. When Brandir walked back to [[Nen Girith]] where the people of Brethil cowered he spoke of the deaths of the children of Húrin and renamed the land, stating that it would never be free of grief.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''[[brethil (Sindarin word)|brethil]]'' is [[Sindarin]] for  "silver birch".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>

''Sarch nia Chîn Húrin'' was the name that [[Brandir]] gave to Brethil, meaning "Grave of the Children of [[Húrin]]".
