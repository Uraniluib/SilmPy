The '''House of Eorl''' was the house of the descendants of [[Eorl the Young]], including all of the recorded [[Kings of Rohan]].
==The Family Trees of the House of Eorl==
Showing the ancestors of Eorl the Young and the three lines of the Kings of Rohan thereafter.  All information in the trees is from Appendix A, either "The House of Eorl"<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> or "The Kings of the Mark"<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref> unless otherwise specified.  The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded.  If a figure stands alone it is a date of birth unless preceded by 'd. ' (in which case it is the date of death).  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name proceeded by '*' indicates a king of the First Line, by '**' indicates a king of the Second Line, and by '***' indicates a king of the Third Line.  A dashed line indicates marriage or a line of descent with some members missing.
===The Ancestors of Eorl the Young===
Eorl was the last [[Lord of the Éothéod]], descended from the first Lord, [[Marhwini]], who had settled his people in the Vales of Anduin after his father [[Marhari]] had died.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>  Marhari was in turn a descendant of [[Vidugavia]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 5</ref>  Thus the forefathers of Eorl claimed descent from the kings of Rhovanion and kinship with the kings of [[Gondor]] descended from [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]].

===The First Line of the Kings of Rohan===
After the victory of Gondor and the [[Éothéod]] at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], the Steward [[Cirion]] gave the land of [[Calenardhon]] to Eorl and his people.  Eorl swore the [[Oath of Eorl]] and brought the Éothéod to their new home, which they named [[Rohan]].  Eorl thus became the first King of Rohan and began the First Line.

===The Second Line of the Kings of Rohan===
After the deaths of Helm Hammerhand and his two sons, Fréalaf, the son of Helm’s sister Hild, became king.  Not only was he closely related to the previous king, but Fréalaf also recaptures Meduseld and killed the usurper, Wulf.  Thus began the Second Line of the Kings of Rohan. 

Through [[Morwen of Lossarnach]], both Thengel's heir [[Théoden]] and his grandson [[Éomer]] carried the blood of the ancient [[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes of Belfalas]].<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> Since the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]] were akin to the [[Lords of Andúnië]], [[Théoden]] and [[Éomer]] are related to [[Elendil]] and descended from the [[House of Elros]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

===The Third Line of the Kings of Rohan===
After the deaths of Théoden and his only son, his nephew Éomer became king, who fought with great distinction at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] where Théoden  was killed. Just like Fréalaf, Éomer was closely related to the previous king.  Thus began the Third Line of the Kings of Rohan, concurrent with the [[Reunited Kingdom]].
