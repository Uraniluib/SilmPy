}}'''Amarië''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[aˈmari.e]}}) was a [[Vanyar]]in [[Elves|Elf]] who was loved by [[Finrod]].

Finrod, son of [[Finarfin]], was a [[Noldor]]in prince who met Amarië in [[Valinor]]. Although in love with one another, they did not marry and Amarië did not follow Finrod into exile to [[Beleriand]];<ref name="S-Noldor">{{S|Noldor}}</ref> according to ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' this was because she was not permitted.<ref name="GA-1">{{GA|109}}</ref> Following Finrod's death, at the hands of [[Sauron]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], he was brought back to life and lives with Amarië in Valinor.<ref name="GA-2">{{GA|180}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. [[Helge Fauskanger]] suggests that this [[Quenya]] name is perhaps derived from ''[[mára]]'' "good".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda}}</ref> 

Another possibility is that the name includes the element ''[[mar]]'', "home"<ref name="EOA">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/amarie.html|articlename=Amarië|website=EoA}}</ref> [[Ruth S. Noel]] makes a similar interpretation and defines ''Amarië'' as "Of the Home".<ref name="LOTME">[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'' (revised edition), p. 108</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Originally [[Finrod]] had a wife named ''Meril'' who went into exile and bore the child [[Gil-galad]] who were both sent to dwell in the [[Havens of the Falas]] for their safety.<ref name="WJ">{{WJ|Ruin}}, p. 242</ref> This was later to changed so Finrod had no child - with Gil-galad becoming the son of [[Orodreth]], Finrod's nephew - and Amarië's beloved remaining in Aman.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 349</ref>
