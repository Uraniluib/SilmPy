'''''There and Back Again''''' was a book written by [[Bilbo Baggins]] recounting his adventures with [[Thorin and Company]] and the quest to reclaim the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]-realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Conceived as his memoirs, the book was begun by Bilbo upon his return to [[Bag End]] but not completed until his retirement in [[Rivendell]]. A version of ''There and Back Again'' translated from its native language of [[Westron]] is said to be the basis for the modern novel known as ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

Bilbo later supplemented the manuscript with translated legends from the [[Elder Days]], which he called ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]''. He passed the book to [[Frodo Baggins]] who added his own memoirs, ''[[The Lord of the Rings|The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings and the Return of the King]]''. Together, these works and other historical and cultural writings of the [[Third Age]] became known as the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], the primary source for the [[legendarium]] of [[Middle-earth]].
