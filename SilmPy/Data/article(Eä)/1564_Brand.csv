'''Brand''' was the son of [[Bain]] and grandson of [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]]<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref> who killed the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref> He was the king of [[Dale]] during the [[War of the Ring]], by which time he had extended the realm of Dale far south and east of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref name="Meetings"/>

==History==
At the [[Council of Elrond]] the dwarf [[Glóin]] reported that a year earlier (in {{TA|3017}}) a messenger from [[Mordor]] had come to speak to [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]].  He also said that messengers had spoken to King Brand and that he was afraid, for war appeared to be gathering on his eastern borders.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

King Brand remained steadfast though.  In {{TA|3019|}} when a host of [[Sauron|Sauron's]] allies crossed the River [[Carnen]] he retreated into [[Dale]].  There the [[Men of Dale]] and the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] fought for three days.  Brand was slain at the side of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] during the [[Battle of Dale]], at the end of which the victorious [[Easterlings]] drove the allies into the Mountain where they were besieged.  However, when news of Sauron's defeat came his northern army was dismayed and the siege was lifted.  King Brand was succeeded by his son, [[Bard II]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Etymology==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] possibly derived the name ''Brand'' from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:brand#Old_English|brand]]'' ("fire-brand, torch; sword").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413 (discussion on name ''[[Erkenbrand]]'')</ref>
