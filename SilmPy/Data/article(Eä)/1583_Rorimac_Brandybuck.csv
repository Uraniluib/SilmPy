'''Rorimac Brandybuck''', also known as '''Old Rory''' and '''Goldfather''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] and [[Master of Buckland]].

==History==
Rorimac was the oldest son of [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]]. He married [[Menegilda Goold]] and had two sons, [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Merimac Brandybuck|Merimac]]. He became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father's death in {{SR|1363}}.<ref name="Brandybuck">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

After the deaths of his sister, [[Primula Brandybuck]] and her husband [[Drogo Baggins]] in {{SR|1380}}, Rorimac took their son, [[Frodo Baggins]] under his guardianship in [[Brandy Hall]], until [[Bilbo Baggins]] took him to [[Bag End]].

Rorimac was present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo's disappearance, Rory was one of the first, if not the only, to suspect "Mad Baggins" was off on an adventure again. As part of his departure, Bilbo left him a dozen of bottles of [[Old Winyards]], and Rory voted Bilbo a capital fellow after the first bottle.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Rory died six years later, passing on the title of Master of Buckland to his eldest son [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]].<ref name="Brandybuck"/>

==Etymology==
''Rory'' is an Anglicization of the Celtic name ''Ruaidhr√≠'', meaning "Red King", whilst ''mac'' means "son of". Whether "son of the red king" is the actual Westron meaning of the name, or an approximation in sound of the original, is unknown.{{fact}}
