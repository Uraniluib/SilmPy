'''''Khuzd''''' pl. '''''Khazâd''''' was the [[Khuzdul]] word for the "[[Dwarves]]". 
==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Sundocarmë|Root]] Kh-Z-D; it is also visible in the words ''[[Khuzdul]]'' and perhaps ''[[Nulukkizdîn|Nulukkhizdîn]]''.

==Derivatives==
The plural form ''Khazâd'' is the basis of [[Quenya]] ''[[casar]]'' and [[Sindarin]] ''[[hadhod]]''. 

The [[Adûnaic]] word ''[[hazad]]'', meaning "seven", is presumably also related.
==Examples==
* [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]
* [[Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!]]
==Other versions==
In earlier versions, the plural was ''Khuzûd'' <ref>{{HM|LR}} pp.274, 278</ref>
