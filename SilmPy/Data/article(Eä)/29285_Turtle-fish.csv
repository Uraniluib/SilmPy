'''Turtle-fish''' was a legendary race of giant sea monsters, mentioned only in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse. The last of the Turtle-fish was named ''[[Fastitocalon]]''.<ref name=Poem>{{AB|Fastitocalon}}</ref>

Turtle-fish appeared as treacherous islands, really being monsters capable of drowning seafarers.<ref name=L255>{{L|255}}; see also "[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]]" (letter)</ref><ref name=Poem/>

==Inspiration==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by an [[Old English]] bestiary, appearing in the [[Wikipedia:Exeter Book|Exeter Book]]. The idea of giant marine turtles ultimately derives from Eastern myths, and in the European versions the monster is often confused with whales.<ref name=L255/>

==Other version of the legendarium==

It is never explained whether the turtle-fish was an actual race or just a fictional character for the poem "[[Fastitocalon (poem)|Fastitocalon]]". In an earlier version of the [[legendarium]], [[Ulmo]], Lord of the Waters, uses his giant whale, [[Uin]], to drag [[Tol EressÃ«a]] towards [[Aman]].<ref>{{HM|LT1}}</ref> This whale reappears in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s story ''[[Roverandom]]''. It is thinkable that Tolkien, in an early phase of the mythology, imagined the fastitocalon to be another one of Ulmo's creatures.
