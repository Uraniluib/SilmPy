The '''Cotton''' family was a working class family of [[Hobbits]].

==Origin==
[[Cottar]], the founder of the Cotton clan, was born some two hundred years before the [[War of the Ring]]. It was his grandson, [[Holman Cotton|Holman]], who was the first to take the surname Cotton. "Long Hom", as Holman was known, is also the first of the Cottons to be explicitly connected with the village of [[Bywater]], which remained the seat of the family from that time on.<ref name="Gamgee">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

Holman's son [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Tolman]] farmed the lands to the south of Bywater, and it was he who made the family one of the most important in [[the Shire]]. He played a significant part in the decisive [[Battle of Bywater]], the most important step in the recovery of the Shire from [[Sharkey's Men]],<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref> and his daughter [[Rose Cotton|Rose]] married [[Samwise Gamgee]] in the following spring.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Cotton'' is a real-life English surname and means "cottage town".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), "Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), entry ''Cotton''</ref>

Thus the name could represent a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Cottun'' "town with cottages".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

It is also a translation of the [[Westron]] '''''Hlothran''''', associated with the name ''[[Cotman#Etymology|Hlothram]]''. Hlothran was "a fairly common village-name in the Shire",<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> though none is mentioned (or noteworthy enough) on any map.

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose to couple the Cottons with the [[Gamgee Family|Gamgees]] because of ''Gamgee cotton'' (also known as ''Gamgee tissue''), a surgical tissue he heard of as a child. It was invented by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampson_Gamgee J. Sampson Gamgee].<ref>{{L|184}}</ref>
