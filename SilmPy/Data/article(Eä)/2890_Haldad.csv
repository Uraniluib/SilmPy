}}'''Haldad''' was a man, the first leader of the [[Haladin]] since their settlement in southern [[Thargelion]].  He was said to be a brave and strong man, and was most famous as the father of [[Haleth]].

==History==

During the early years after they crossed the [[Blue Mountains]], the [[Haladin]] dwelt happily in [[Caranthir]]'s lands in [[Thargelion]]. They lived a scattered, pastoral existence until one day a swarm of [[Orcs]] descended on them, without warning, out of the Blue Mountains to the east.

Until that time, the Haladin had no single leader, but upon the coming of the orc-assault Haldad, a man of renown among his kin, took on the role.  He gathered what remnant he could of his people, and built a [[Gelion-Ascar Stockade|defensive stockade]] between the rivers [[Gelion]] and [[Ascar]], south of [[Sarn Athrad]]. There the Orcs [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade|besieged them]] until their food was exhausted. Haldad led a sortie against the attacking Orcs, and was slain; his son [[Haldar]] rushed to recover his father's body, and was slain in turn.

Haldad's death was not in vain; Haldad's daughter [[Haleth]] led the Haladin through another week of starvation and siege until Caranthir's army appeared out of the north, and drove the attacking Orcs to their deaths.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>
