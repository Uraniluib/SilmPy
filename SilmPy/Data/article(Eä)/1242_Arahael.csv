'''Arahael''' ({{TA|2012}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2177|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 165) was the second [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], succeeding his father, [[Aranarth]], when he died in 2106.

==History==
Arahael was raised by [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]] (as were all his descendants) while his father protected [[Eriador]] from the evils of the wild with the help of other [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]].

Arahael's reign was uneventful (as far as we know), due to the secretive (and therefore now little-known) nature of the [[Dúnedain]], and the [[Watchful Peace]] which there was at that time. It is likely that the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against [[orcs]] in order to keep the region safe.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Arahael died in 2177, having been Chieftain for 65 years, and was followed by his son, [[Aranuir]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Arahael's name is [[Sindarin]] and probably means "Wise King", coming from the prefix ''[[ar|ara-]]'' meaning "king", and ''sael'' (becoming mutated to ''hael'') meaning "wise".
