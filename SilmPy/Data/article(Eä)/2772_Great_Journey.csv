The '''Great Journey''', or the '''Great March''' was the journey that the [[Elves]] known as the [[Eldar]] took from [[Cuiviénen]], the place of their [[Awakening of the Elves|awakening]], to [[Valinor]].

After the [[War for Sake of the Elves|War]] of the [[Valar]] against [[Morgoth|Melkor]] much of northern Middle-earth was broken, and then [[Oromë]] returned to take the Elves with him into the West. In {{YT|1105}} the majority of the Elves began to depart and were called Eldar, but a part remained behind, becoming known as the [[Avari]] (The "Refusers"), in the [[Sundering of the Elves]]. Even the Eldar however were reluctant, being used to the beauties of Middle-earth, and were urged by Oromë and their respective chieftains; the most eager were the [[Minyar]], followed by the [[Tatyar]], and the most reluctant were the [[Nelyar]].

Oromë guided the Eldar north of the [[Sea of Helcar]], passing under the smoke of the ruined [[Iron Mountains|Ered Engrin]]. Some Eldar fled in fear, and disappeared from history, perhaps merging back with the Avari. Later the host passed through a great forest (the [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]]), on the path where later was the [[Dwarf Road]], and then long waited at the shores of a Great River [[Anduin]] while Oromë sought a way to get them over the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]] mountains, which were much higher in those days.

By {{YT|1115}} Oromë returned, having found (or forged) the [[High Pass]] (where later was built [[Rivendell]]), most Eldar went on, but a group of the [[Teleri]] remained behind and went down the Anduin under their leader Dan (or [[Lenwë]]), becoming known as the [[Nandor]].

The remaining Eldar passed north of the immense forests that covered all of [[Eriador]], along a route that would become later the [[Great West Road]] (that ran through [[Arnor]]). Finally in {{YT|1125}} the [[Minyar]] and [[Tatyar]] crossed the [[Ered Luin]] and reached [[Beleriand]], while the [[Lindar]] still lagged behind in Eriador. For this reason they became known as the [[Teleri]] (the "Last").<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

The Teleri finally entered [[Beleriand]] in {{YT|1128}} but remained east of [[Gelion]]; in {{YT|1132}} the first two clans were ferried across [[Belegaer]] on [[Tol Eressëa]] by [[Ulmo]]. When Ulmo returned for them in {{YT|1150}}, the greater part of the Teleri finally crossed Belegaer under [[Olwe]]. But a part of the Teleri remained behind again, either because they were enamored by the shores, or because the [[Eglath]] were looking for their leader [[Elwe]], becoming the [[Sindar]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>
