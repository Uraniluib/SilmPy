'''''Bark''''' pl. '''''baruk''''' is a [[Khuzdul]] word which means "axe". 

It is another example of "broken plurals" in Khuzdul, similar to "khuzd" and "khazâd".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 85</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Root]] *B-R-K

It is possible that "baruk" is also a genitive case, meaning "axes of <something>" rather than just "axes". The phrase "baruk Khazâd" can be compared to a "construct pair" in Semitic languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic.<ref>Magnus Åberg, ''[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html Mellonath Daeron: An analysis of Dwarvish]'', as of 6 September 2010</ref>

==Example==
* ''Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!'' - "Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!"<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 296</ref>
