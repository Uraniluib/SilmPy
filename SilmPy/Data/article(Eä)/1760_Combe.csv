'''Combe''' was a village that lay in a deep valley east of [[Staddle]] (which was on the eastern side of [[Bree-hill]] opposite of [[Bree]]).<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>  

==Etymology==
The village took its name from its location. [[Old English]] ''cumb'' means "hollow, valley", cognate to [[Welsh]] ''cwm''. Although the name is Old English, [[David Salo]] has suggested that it is intended to be a [[Celtic]]ism, like [[Bree]], [[Archet]] and [[Chetwood]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

The same element appears in "[[Deeping-coomb]]", a valley in the [[White Mountains]].

:Combe is a busy village that is visted by the player during ''[[Stirrings in the Darkness]]''. Weary travellers can relax and drink in the [[Comb and Wattle Inn]]. The village is commanded by Constable Underhill.
