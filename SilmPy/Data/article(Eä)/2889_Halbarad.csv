'''Halbarad''' was a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] of [[Eriador]]. 

==Life==
Halbarad spent his early life watching the borders of [[the Shire]]. 

During the [[War of the Ring]], Halbarad was sent to the aid of his [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] [[Aragorn]]. From [[Eriador]], he led a thirty-man strong group of Rangers, calling themselves the [[Grey Company]]. With them rode [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], the sons of [[Elrond]]. In the night between the [[5 March|5th]] and the [[6 March|6th of March]], the Company met Aragorn at [[Dol Baran]]. Halbarad gave his kinsman a standard, which was a gift from [[Arwen]], and a message, summoning him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref name="Company"/>

The Grey Company, now with [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] part of [[Aragorn]]'s comitatus, passed through the Paths of the Dead, to the [[Stone of Erech]], over [[Tarlang's Neck]], and on to [[Pelargir]]. He captained a [[Corsair]] ship and they sailed toward [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]].<ref name="Debate">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

On [[15 March|March 15]] they arrived on the [[Pelennor Fields]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|battle]]. Halbarad unfurled the standard, and it showed the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] of [[Gondor]] and the signs of [[Elendil]]. He was killed in this battle, and would never return to the North.<ref name="Battle">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Though it is nowhere translated, ''Halbarad'' most likely means "Tall Tower", from [[Sindarin]] ''[[hall]]'', "tall", and ''[[barad]]'', "tower".

After suffering short delays in Enedwaith, Halbarad managed to form an alliance of sorts with the Falcon Clan in Dunland. However, Halbarad and his company were soon betrayed and imprisoned by the Falcon Clan. Some of the Rangers with Halbarad managed to escape and soon the Grey Company was free, at the cost of many lives. By the time they reached the borders of Rohan, only 30 of their number remained. At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Halbarad sacrifices himself to protect Aragorn from being killed by [[Gothmog]].
