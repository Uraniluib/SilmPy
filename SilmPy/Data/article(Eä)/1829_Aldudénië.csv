'''Aldudénië''' ([[Quenya|Q]], possibly pron. {{IPA|[ˌalduˈdeːni.ɛ]}}) is a poem lamenting the death of the [[Two Trees]], composed by [[Elemmírë (Elf)|Elemmírë]] of the [[Vanyar]], soon after the [[Darkening of Valinor|event]]. It was famous to all the [[Eldar]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>
==Etymology==
''Aldudénie'' is said to mean "lament of the Two Trees" and contains ''[[alda|aldu]]'', the dual of ''[[alda]]'' "tree".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

The other element *''dénie'' which obviously means "lament", is of problematic etymology since the intermedial "d" does not exist in [[Quenya]] (only the "ld" "nd" and "rd" are present).

Another similar Quenya word for lament is ''[[nainië]]'' from [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[NAY]].
