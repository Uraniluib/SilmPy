'''Mablung''' was [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger of Ithilien]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Mablung's family had lived in [[Ithilien]] before it was overrun by the forces of [[Sauron]]. As such, he was given a place among the Rangers of Ithilien, [[Denethor]]'s most trusted forayers.<ref name="Herbs">{{HM|TT}}, "[[Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit]]"</ref>
 
Together with [[Damrod]], [[Anborn]] and several others, Mablung served under the [[Steward]]'s second son, [[Faramir]]. They were sent to intercept a troop of [[Southrons]] in March {{TA|3019}}, and there, they came across [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]]. While standing guard over Faramir's guest with Damrod, he briefly conversed with them. Faramir, in the meantime, went on to ambush the Haradrim.<ref name="Herbs"/>

Mablung and Damrod remained the guards of the Ring-bearer during their short stay at [[Henneth Ann√ªn]].<ref name="Window">{{TT|Window}}</ref>

With his Lord injured, Mablung was given command of the Rangers after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. When the [[Army of the West]] marched on the [[Morannon]], Mablung and his troops scouted the road and discovered an ambush by [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]] that lay hid in [[Ithilien]]. The ambush was quickly turned.<ref name="Gate">{{RK|V10}}</ref>
