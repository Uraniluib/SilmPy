'''Min-Rimmon''' was one of the seven [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon-hills]] of [[Gondor]], on the northern flanks of the [[White Mountains]].  It was the fifth beacon west of [[Minas Tirith]]<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> and was the highest peak in a group of crags known as the ''Rimmon''. With [[Eilenach]] and [[Amon DÃ®n]], Min-Rimmon was one of the oldest beacons, set in place even before the foundation of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref name=RC/>

On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''[[mindon|Min]]'' means "peak" in [[Sindarin]]<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 511</ref>, thus ''Min-Rimmon'' refers to the "Peak of the Rimmon".  "Rimmon" is a name of forgotten origin, coming from the [[Second Age]] before Gondor was established.<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>
