'''Azanulbizar''' was the [[Khuzdul]] name for "[[Dimrill Dale]]".<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> The name was lent to the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|battle]] fought there.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explored various possibilities regarding the exact interpretation of the elements occurring in the name: it is either ''[[Azanul]]'' + ''[[bizar]]'' or ''[[Uzn|Azan]]+[[Ã»l]]+[[bizar]]'', though the whole was to somehow express "Dimrill Dale".

Tolkien stated that "the Common Speech form is an accurate translation: the valley of the dim (overshadowed) rills that ran down the mountainside".<ref>[[Jared Lobdell]] (ed.), ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', p. 182</ref> In another point it is given as "Vale of Dim Streams" with three elements.<ref name="RS">{{HM|RS}}, p. 466</ref>

The first interpretation says that ''azan'' "shadows, dimnesses", ''[[-ul]]'' genitive marker and ''bizar'' "streams, rills"; in this interpretation it means "rills of shadows", and the word "dale" is understood (the full name being ''[[duban]] Azanulbizar'').<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 269</ref> 

According to the second interpretation, ''bizar'' means "dale" and ''ul'' "rill(s), streams".<ref name="RS"/>
