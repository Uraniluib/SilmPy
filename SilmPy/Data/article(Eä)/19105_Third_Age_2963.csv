==Note==
In the second edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s year of birth was added to ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' as 2963.  This contradicted both the ''Longfather Tree of Master Samwise''<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> and a later entry in ''The Tale of Years''.<ref>{{App|Later}}, S.R. 1469</ref> The incorrect date has been corrected (to {{TA|2980}}) in the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th anniversary edition]]. See also ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 716.
