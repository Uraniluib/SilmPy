'''Elms''' were tall trees that grew throughout the northern regions of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Treebeard]] especially noted the elm-woods of [[Ossiriand]], to the east of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>  When [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]'s cousin [[Halfast Gamgee|Hal]] said he saw a Tree-man or giant in the [[Northfarthing]] he said it was "as big as an elm tree".<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>
