The '''Free Peoples of the World'''<ref name="South">{{FR|South}}</ref> were those people who were not under [[Sauron]]'s domination. 

By the later [[Third Age]] Sauron had [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]] and other creatures under his control, and other peoples like the [[Men of Darkness]] enslaved or allied with him. As such, the Free Peoples were the [[Elves]], [[DÃºnedain|High]] and [[Middle Men]], [[Hobbits]], [[Dwarves]], and any folk who opposed him.

In the [[Council of Elrond]], [[Boromir]] made a mention of the "Free Lords of the Free", possibly referring to the rulers of the Free Peoples, such as [[Elrond]] or [[Denethor|Denethor II]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 152, entry "Free Lords of the Free"</ref> while suggesting that they should use [[the One Ring]] against Sauron.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

The members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] were specifically chosen so that at least one representative of all the free peoples would be there: one for the [[Elves]], one for the [[Dwarves]] and two for [[Men]].<ref name="South"/> As they had appeared relatively late in the knowledge of most, [[Hobbits]] were generally not reckoned among them until the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>
