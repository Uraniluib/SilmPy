'''Armenelos the Golden''', referred to as [[City of the Kings|The City of Kings]], was the capital and (in later years) the largest city of [[Númenor]].

It was situated on a hill in eastern central [[Númenor]], in the district called [[Arandor]], the Kingsland, close to [[Meneltarma]] and the haven of [[Rómenna]]. Armenelos contained the royal palace, the [[King's House]], reportedly built with the help of the [[Maiar]], with [[Nimloth]]. 

==History==
It was founded as far back as the end of the [[First Age]], when the [[Edain]] first migrated to the island. Conceivably [[Arandor]] was the first district they settled after landing in a firth that later led to the haven of [[Rómenna]].

Its finishing, together with the coronation of [[Elros]] in {{SA|32}}, marked the beginning of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] realm.

In the later years Armelenos became the largest city of the island as [[Andúnië]] declined. The [[Temple]] was built there by [[Sauron]].
==Etymology==
The name is obviously [[Quenya]] and possibly means "royal-heaven-fortress"<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Armenelos"</ref> analyzed as ''[[ar-]]'' + ''[[menel]]'' + ''[[ost]]''.

The [[Adûnaic]] name is '''Ar-Minalêth'''<ref>{{PM|V}}, p. 145</ref> which appears to be a direct translation of the Quenya name, analyzed as ''ar-'' + ''minul'' (Adûnaic name of menel).<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articlename=Adûnaic|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/adunaic.htm}}</ref>

At early stages of writing, this city was called by other names: ''Númenos'',<ref name=Fall>{{LR|Fall}}, pp. 11, 14, 19, 30</ref> ''Númar''<ref name=Fall/> or ''Nûmar''<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 26</ref> (at first used of what became ''Númenor'')
