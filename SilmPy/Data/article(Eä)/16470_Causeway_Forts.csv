The '''Causeway Forts''' were fortified twin towers, which made up the gate guarding the [[Causeway (Gondor)|Causeway]] road from [[Osgiliath]] to [[Minas Tirith]]. The road ran through the [[Rammas Echor]] into the [[Pelennor Fields]].

== History ==
During the [[War of the Ring]], they were guarded by [[Faramir]] against the [[Witch-king]] but were easily overrun.
