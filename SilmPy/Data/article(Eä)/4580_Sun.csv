The '''Sun''', the source of daylight, rose in the [[East]] of [[Middle-earth]] and sank in the [[West (disambiguation)|West]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}: "''...the Sun rode up from the East.''"</ref><ref>{{FR|II6}}: "''...the sun sank behind the westward heights''"</ref>

==History==

During the [[Years of the Trees]], [[Valinor]] was lit for many thousands of years by the light of the [[Two Trees]], [[Telperion]] the Silver and [[Laurelin]] the Gold. When these were destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]], [[Arda]] was plunged into darkness. Through the power of [[Nienna]] and [[Yavanna]], though, [[Laurelin]] produced a single fiery fruit before it died. This golden fire was set in a vessel made by [[Aulë]] and his people, and steered into the sky by the [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Arien]].<ref name=OfSun>{{S|11}}</ref>

[[Valinor]] was in the West of the World, and so the first sunrise was in the west, not the east. Originally, [[Arien]] was to have steered Anar ceaselessly from west to east and back again, always remaining in the sky, but the [[Valar]] changed this counsel, so that each evening Anar would descend into the distant western seas, and re-emerge each morning in the east.<ref name=OfSun/>

The Sun was seen by the Elves as a sign for the awakening of [[Men]], and they valued the [[Moon]] higher.<ref name=OfSun/> [[Morgoth]]'s creatures, the [[Orcs]], feared the Sun, and with the exception of the [[Uruk-hai]], they did not travel while it was in the sky.

The [[Trolls]] of [[Middle-earth]] feared the Sun even more, and with great reason: they turned to stone under its light. Only the later [[Olog-hai]] were able to move under the Sun.
==Names of the Sun==

Names of the Sun amongst the [[Elves]] included 
*'''''Anar''''' (derived from the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[ANÁR]]<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 348</ref>) or '''The Fire-golden'''<ref name=SSun>{{S|Sun}}</ref>, a name given to it by the [[Vanyar]].
*'''''Anor''''' (derived from the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[ANÁR]]<ref name=LR/>), the common name for the Sun in [[Sindarin]], as seen in ''[[Minas Anor]]'', the [[Gondor|Gondorian]] province of [[Anórien]], and ''[[elanor]]'' ("Sun-star").
*'''''Vása''''' ("the Consumer"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>), or '''Heart of Fire''', a name given to the Sun by the [[Noldor]] as it marked the waning of the Elves.<ref name=SSun/>

'''''Aþâraigas''''', meaning "appointed heat", was the name of the Sun in [[Valarin]].{{fact}}

A poetic name for the Sun was ''The Daystar'', and [[Gollum]] referred to it as ''The Yellow Face''.

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In the early versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as described in [[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]], a part of [[the History of Middle-earth]] series, the Sun was described in great detail as an immense island of fire. It was also said there that the youth [[Tilion]], who guided the Moon, was said to secretly be in love with Arien, and that because he steered the Moon too close to the Sun the Moon was burned.

In writings not included in the Silmarillion tradition, Morgoth at one point was infatuated with Arien, and wanted to claim her as his wife: he is at one point even described as ravishing her, so she abandoned her body and 'died': the Sun after this for a while left its course, burning a large part of [[Arda]] the world (apparently creating the deserts of Far [[Harad]]). It is not clear if this would have been included in the Silmarillion had Tolkien lived to publish it himself.

In the [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|Round World]] version of the legendarium, the Sun and the Moon were not the fruit of the Two Trees, but actually preceded the creation of the Trees. Instead, the Trees preserved the light of the Sun before it was tainted by Melkor when he ravished Arien.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, "Text V: Sun  The Trees  Silmarils", pp. 389-90</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] stated that "''[[Elves]] (and [[Hobbits]]) always refer to the Sun as She''",<ref>{{FR|I9}}, footnote</ref><ref group=note>Also, [[Arien]] was a female [[Maiar|Maia]]. For an example of the feminine form of the Sun, cf. {{FR|II3}}: ''"'I have not brought the Sun. '''She''' is walking in the blue fields of the South...'"'' ([[Legolas]]).</ref> and Yvette L. Kisor has remarked that the reference to the Sun as a female entity in the [[legendarium]] derived from [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]] mythology and language.<ref>Yvette L.
