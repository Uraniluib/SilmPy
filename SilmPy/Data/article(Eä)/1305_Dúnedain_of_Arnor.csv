The '''Dúnedain of Arnor''' were one of the two great divisions of the descendants of the [[Númenóreans]] in [[Middle-earth]] (the other being the [[Gondorians]] of the South-kingdom). 

==History==
The North-kingdom of [[Arnor]] had originally held the capital of High King [[Elendil]] at [[Annúminas]], and the [[Dúnedain]] of that land were ruled for centuries by the descendants of Elendil's eldest son [[Isildur]]. 

The population of Arnor suffered a lot during the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]; after Isildur's death in {{TA|2}}, not many Dúnedain or [[Middle Men]] of [[Eriador]] remained to populate the places built by Elendil.<ref name=rings>{{s|Rings}}</ref>

Arnor was ruled by his direct descendants, beginning with [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], his youngest son. Before the end of the first millennium of the [[Third Age]], the land of Arnor fell into dispute between the sons of King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], and the Dúnedain who lived there became divided into three realms: [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. One by one, these kingdoms fell to war, plague, and assaults by the witch-realm of [[Angmar]], until at last the Dúnedain of Arnor had become a dwindled and wandering people known as the [[Rangers of the North]]. Their ancestry was forgotten and unknown, except in [[Rivendell]].<ref name=rings/> 

Nonetheless, the line of Isildur was maintained through the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftains]] of this people. [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] was Isildur's Heir through thirty-nine generations, and it was he who reunited the [[Realms in Exile|Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] after three thousand years of separation.<ref name=rings/><ref>{{App|A}}</ref>
