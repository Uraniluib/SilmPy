'''Ambarussa''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌambaˈrusːa]}}) was [[Nerdanel|Nerdanel's]] [[Amilessë|mother-name]] for her twin sons [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]]. It translates as "top-russet", referring to the color of their hair.  After [[Fëanor]] their father insisted on giving them each separate names Nerdanel named Amras ''[[Umbarto]]'', the fated, and Fëanor changed it to ''[[Ambarto]]''.  But the twins each still called the other ''Ambarussa''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod'', p. 353</ref>
