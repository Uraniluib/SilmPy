'''Cuiviénen''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌkuɪviˈeːnen]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌkuɪβiˈeːnen]}}) was a bay on the shore of the inland [[Sea of Helcar]] in the far east of [[Middle-earth]] and by extension, the land near the [[Wild Wood]] at the foot of [[Orocarni]] where the [[Quendi]] or [[Elves]] awoke.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

==History==
[[Ilúvatar|Eru]] first [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]] the Elves there in approximately 1050 of the [[Years of the Trees]].  From the first they were divided into three groups: the [[Minyar]], [[Tatyar]], and [[Nelyar]]. They dwelt in Cuiviénen for more than five hundred [[Valian Years]] before the first [[Sundering of the Elves|sundering]].  Many of the Elves, particularly of the Minyar and Tatyar, journeyed west to [[Valinor]] and, if they did not tarry in Middle-earth, saw its light and became known as the [[Eldar]].  Those who remained were called the [[Avari]], the unwilling, for they did not desire to see the beauty of that land, but preferred the starlight of Cuiviénen.

==Etymology==
The [[Quenya]] name ''Cuiviénen'' (''[[cuivië]]'' "awakening" + ''[[nen]]'' "water") means "water of awakening".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>
