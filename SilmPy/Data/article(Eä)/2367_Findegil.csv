}}'''Findegil''' was the [[King's Writer]] of [[Gondor]] in the [[Fourth Age]].

==History==
Findegil presumably served under the Kingship of [[Eldarion]]<ref>The year of Eldarion's death is not recorded, but he would have been at most 171 years old and reigned 52 years when Findegil appears in the records.</ref> in the [[Fourth Age]].

In {{FoA|172}}, Findegil wrote a copy of the  [[Thain's Book]] for the [[Thain]] of the [[Shire]], probably at the request of [[Peregrin Took]]'s great-grandson.  This copy was the only one to include [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s complete [[Translations from the Elvish]], which Bilbo had composed while at [[Rivendell]] during his 'retirement' there.
