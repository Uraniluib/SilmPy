'''Merimac Brandybuck''' was a Hobbit of [[Buckland]].

==History==
Merimac was the youngest son of [[Rorimac Brandybuck]] and [[Menegilda Goold]]. He had one son, [[Berilac Brandybuck|Berilac]], and they were both present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Merimac'' is, like most male Brandybuck names, Celtic in sound, but apparently meaningless. The first element, ''Meri'', is similar to ''[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]'', and could, like in that name, have been based on Buckland Westron ''kali'', "jolly, gay".<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref> ''Mac'' is a Celtic word meaning "son", though it is unknown whether Tolkien used it with that meaning in mind. The entire name also resembles ''[[wikipedia:Merrimac|Merrimac]]'', a name of a river and several towns in the United States. That word is of Native American origin.
