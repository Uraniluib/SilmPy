The river '''Ringwil''' was a short and foaming river of [[West Beleriand]] that flowed east through the hilly [[Taur-en-Faroth|High Faroth]] north of [[Nargothrond]] until it joined the [[Narog]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  Where it met the Narog a secret door was built, which was used by [[LÃºthien]] to escape from Nargothrond when Celegorm and [[Curufin]] held her prisoner.
