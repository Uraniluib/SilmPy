'''Obel Halad''' was the "capital" of [[Brethil]], the homeland of the People of [[Haleth]].  Within this settlement was the hall of the ''[[Halad]]'' or Warden of Brethil, who was the leader of the land.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 263</ref>  ''Obel Halad'' meant the Fortified Settlement of the Halad.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the development of the story, "[[The Wanderings of HÃºrin]]" (a tale that [[Christopher Tolkien]] regretfully excluded from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''), Obel Halad replaced [[Ephel Brandir]] as the chief settlement of the [[Haladin]].<ref>{{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 17, p. 301</ref>  Since Ephel Brandir was built upon [[Amon Obel]]<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref> it is likely that its replacement was also intended to be in the same location.
