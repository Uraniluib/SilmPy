'''Tomatoes''' were supposedly a plant known to the [[Hobbits]]. 

They were referenced in the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 34</ref> but [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] changed this to "pickles" in the third edition (1966).<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, note 11, p. 43</ref>  The most usual explanation for the change is that the American plant-life would not fit in his setting of ancient [[Middle-earth]].  However, as pointed out by [[John D. Rateliff]], it may have been simply that Tolkien felt that it was too early in the year for tomatoes and substituted a preserved food instead.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, note 18, p. 18</ref>
