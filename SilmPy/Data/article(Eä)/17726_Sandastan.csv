'''''Sandastan''''' was the [[Quenya]] word for a defensive formation used by the soldiers of the [[Númenórean Realms]], better known by the [[Sindarin]] '''''[[thangail]]'''''.<ref>{{UT|7}}.</ref>

==Etymology==
The final element in ''sandastan'' is derived from the stem ''stama-'' meaning bar or exclude, so the literal translation is probably 'shield-barrier'.<ref>[[Ardalambion]]: [http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist]. Retrieved 2010-09-01.</ref>
