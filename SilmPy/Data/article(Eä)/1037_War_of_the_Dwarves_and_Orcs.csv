The '''War of the Dwarves and Orcs''' was a great war fought between the two races.

==History==
=== Prelude ===
In {{TA|2770}} [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] was [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>. Many of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]] were rendered homeless and wandered through western [[Middle-earth]], trying to make as best a living they could. After some years of wandering they settled down in [[Dunland]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Among these Dwarves were [[Thrór]], formerly the [[King under the Mountain]] now King of Durin's folk in exile, his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and grandson [[Thorin II]] who became later known as Thorin Oakenshield.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

Thrór fell into despair after living many years in poverty, or perhaps the [[Rings of Power|Ring]] he wore was ultimately working evil upon its bearer.<ref name="Durin"/> Whatever the case, he decided to leave his people in {{TA|2790|n}}<ref name="TA"/> to seek out and look upon the ancestral halls of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. Accompanied by his friend [[Nár]], they crossed the [[Redhorn Pass]] and came down to the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria]] where Thrór took it upon himself to enter alone, despite the warnings of Nár who stayed behind in the dale. 

Thrór was caught and slain by [[Azog]] the [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain who had ruled in Moria, and after a few days Thrór's head was branded with Azog's name and the corpse was thrown out of the gate where it was found by Nár. He was left alive to serve as a messenger to the Dwarves that Azog now claimed to be the King of Moria, and to stay away.

When Nár returned to the king's son Thráin, he told him of his father's murder and the Orc's warning. For seven days without eating or sleeping the new king sat, until he stood and cried "This cannot be borne!"<ref name="Durin"/>

From 2790 to {{TA|2793|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the [[Longbeards]] responded to this tragedy by gathering an army, and calling on all the other six Houses of the Dwarves for war.

=== Early Stages===
In 2793 the Dwarven host was ready, and departed for war; assailing and sacking all the Orc-holds they could find from [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] in the north, to the [[Gladden River|Gladden]] in the south one by one. 

Little is actually known about the six year-long war, however it is known that most of it was fought underground, in the great mines and tunnels of the Misty Mountains, where Dwarves excelled in combat.<ref name="Durin"/>

=== The Final Battle ===
The war came to a climax in {{TA|2799|n}}<ref name="TA"/> when the final battle was fought in the Dimrill Dale below the East-gate of [[Moria]], the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|Battle of Azanûlbizar]]. The Dwarves gained victory in this notoriously bloody encounter when reinforcements arrived late on the scene from the [[Iron Hills]]. Azog was slain by [[Dáin Ironfoot]].  

In its aftermath, King Thráin wanted to enter reclaim the city, but the Dwarves not of Durin's folk refused, saying that the city was not their Fathers' House; they had honored Thrór's memory by fighting and that was enough. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] also warned the king that [[Durin's Bane]] still dwelt within Khazad-dûm.<ref name="Durin"/>

===Aftermath===
The war was very costly for the Dwarves: Nearly half of those involved in the final battle were killed and with a possibility of a couple thousand more being killed throughout the rest of the war. [[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]], [[Frerin]], and [[Fundin]] were among the more notable casualties. Thráin II himself lost an eye and gained a limp, and Thorin was wounded when his shield broke and he had to use an oak branch to defend himself-hence the epithet "[[Oakenshield]]".<ref name="Durin"/>

The Orcs suffered irreparable damage to their numbers by war's end. Ten thousand alone were killed in the Dimrill Dale, and it seem highly likely that at least that many were killed throughout the previous six years of the war.
Those that survived the final battle (as many as 10,000 or so) fled south through [[Rohan]], seeking refuge in the [[White Mountains]] beyond, where they troubled the [[Rohirrim]] for two generations.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> In {{TA|2851}}<ref name="TA"/> King [[Walda]] was slain with all his companions by Orcs near [[Dunharrow]].  His son [[Folca]] hunted down and eliminated the last Orc-hold in the White Mountains.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line''</ref>

As a result of such losses, the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] virtually disappeared as a threat to [[Eriador]] and  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. One and a half centuries later the Orcs of the North were recovering, but their numbers were permanently depleted to severely low levels in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Five Armies]] in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name="TA"/> It was here that [[Bolg]] son of Azog tried to avenge his father and the [[Great Goblin]], but in his failure three fourths of his people were killed.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

The repercussions of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs likely even had an impact on the very outcome of the [[War of the Ring]].
