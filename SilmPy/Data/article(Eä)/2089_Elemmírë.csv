{{disambig-two|the planet|[[Vanyar|Vanyarin]] elf|[[Elemmírë (Elf)]]}} 

'''Elemmírë''' was one of the lights kindled by [[Varda]] far in the past, to welcome the [[Elves]] to [[Arda]] on their awakening. It is described in [[Quenta Silmarillion]] as a star, but in fact it was most likely identified with one of the planets.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Elemmírë means "star-jewel". It's a compound from ''[[elen]]'' and ''[[mírë]]''. The letters ''n+m'' from both words are assimilated to long ''mm''

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s notes on the subject are open to interpretation, but they appear to identify Elemmírë as the planet we know today as Mercury.<ref>{{MR|Star}}, p. 435</ref>
