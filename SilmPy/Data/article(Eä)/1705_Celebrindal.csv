'''Celebrindal''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[keleˈbrindal]}}) was the surname, meaning 'silver-foot' ([[Sindarin]] ''[[celeb]]'' "silver" + ''[[tâl]]'' "foot") , of [[Turgon]]'s daughter [[Idril]], who became the mother of [[Eärendil]] the Mariner. She gained the name, apparently, because she walked barefoot wherever she went.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>
