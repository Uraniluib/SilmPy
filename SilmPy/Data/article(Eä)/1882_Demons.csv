'''Demons''' were evil [[spirits (creatures)|spirits]] that ranked among the most powerful of [[Morgoth]]'s servants. Among the mightiest demons were the [[Balrogs]], who were fiery [[Maiar]] seduced to [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s service in the beginning of the world. The Dark Lord also commanded lesser demons.<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref><ref>{{S|9}} ("''...countless became the hosts of [Morgoth's] beasts and his demons''")</ref>

==Names==

The [[Quenya]] word for "demon" is ''rauka'', and the [[Sindarin]] cognate was ''raug''. Both derive from the [[root]] [[RUKU|RUK]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 48</ref>

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "demon" is ''graug''. A cognate of the same meaning in [[Qenya]] is given as ''arauke''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 42</ref>
