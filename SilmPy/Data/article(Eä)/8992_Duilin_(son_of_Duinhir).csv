'''Duilin''' was one of the two sons of [[Duinhir]], the lord of [[Blackroot Vale]].

==History==
With his brother [[Derufin]], Duilin followed his father to [[Minas Tirith]] in the [[War of the Ring]],<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> and there they fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. The Men of the distant valley of [[Morthond]] had great skill as bowmen, and so Duilin and Derufin led their archers against the [[mûmakil]], attempting to shoot out the beasts' eyes. Brave as they were, both the brothers were lost in that battle, trampled by their gigantic foes.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Duilin'' is a Sindarin word for "nightingale".

:A Decipher card identifies one of the [[Rangers of Ithilien|Rangers]] of [[Ithilien]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' as Duilin.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Duilin and [[Derufin|his brother]] were hunting enthusiasts. Bored waiting for battle, they sneaked across the river to [[Ithilien]] to hunt. They could be found in Bar Húrin. In [[The Strength of Sauron|Epic Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron]] the player accompanied them as they attempted to hunt [[Oliphaunts|mûmakil]]. They encountered more than one mûmak and, finding them larger than expected, were quickly forced to flee. However the brothers noted the beasts' eyes as vulnerable targets, and despite the failure they agreed to help the player search [[Osgiliath]] for [[Faramir]] in exchange for the assistance. The brothers accompanied the player into the city, and the group succeeded in damaging [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] before encountering [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] and being forced to retreat.
