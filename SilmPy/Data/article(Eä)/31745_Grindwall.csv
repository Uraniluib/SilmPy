[[File:Mark Fisher - Withywindle.png|thumb|Map of the Withywindle]]'''Grindwall''' was a small hythe (landing) on the north bank of the [[Withywindle]].  It was outside of the [[High Hay]] and so was well watched and protected by a ''grind'' or fence extending into the water.  On rising ground behind the hythe was the village of [[Breredon]].<ref>{{ATB|Preface}}</ref>
