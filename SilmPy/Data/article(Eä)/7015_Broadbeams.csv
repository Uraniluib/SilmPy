The '''Broadbeams''' were one of the seven houses of the [[Dwarves]]. They were originally paired with the [[Firebeards]]. The ancestor of the Broadbeams was among the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves (together with the ancestors of the [[Firebeards]] and [[Longbeards]]).<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref>

The Broadbeams (with the Firebeards) awoke in [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] in the [[Blue Mountains]], and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the Blue Mountains, and dwelt in them before their ruining in the [[War of Wrath]]. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  In an [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|earlier version of the legendarium]] the two cities are clearly inhabited by separate houses; however, Belegost is said to be the home of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]].<ref name="#">{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

In the [[Second Age]], around the year {{SA|40|n}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> the Firebeards and Broadbeams who lived in Nogrod and Belegost left the destruction behind and came to [[Khazad-dûm]], increasing its wealth and power.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>
