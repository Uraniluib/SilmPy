'''Tharbad''' was a city and a ford on the southern edge of [[Eriador]], high up along the once densely forested banks of the [[Gwathló]].

==Geography==
Above Tharbad the rivers [[Mitheithel]] and [[Glanduin]] met to form the big river [[Gwathló]]; their sluggish water spread to a network of swamps, pools and eyots, fens populated by [[swans]], and many other waterbirds.<ref name="GC">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> This huge fenland the elves named '[[Swanfleet|Nîn-in-Eilph]]'.

The city was built across Greyflood below that point; the [[Greenway]] crossed the river at a ford there and became the "[[Old South Road]]".
==History==
===Second Age===
In the early [[Second Age]] the '[[Swanfleet]]' river, entered the southern part of the [[Noldor|Noldor]]in realm [[Eregion]]. In the sixth century of that Age [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] went much on land as well as sea, and went up the River Gwathló as far as Tharbad, and there met [[Galadriel]].<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>

Such early river voyages were also made by hardy explorers of [[Númenor]], in ships of smaller draught,<ref name=UT>{{HM|UT}}</ref> but such journeys up the Gwathló increased rapidly after the Númenóreans constructed a small harbour at the river's estuary to exploit the local timber: '[[Vinyalondë]]', 'the New Haven'.

By {{SA|1695}}, the Númenóreans were devastating the forests below Tharbad, and had been obliged to build forts both at the Haven and along the river, to protect their ship-building yards and wood-stores from the local population, who were understandably hostile, treated as enemies.<ref name="GC"/>

Despite overrunning all of Eriador in the war which began in that year, Sauron's armies had eventually been forced back to the fortified River Gwathló, where they were held. Beforehand, Sauron had not enough force to spare for any assault upon the forts, but late in the war he had summoned more forces, which were approaching from the south-east, and were indeed in [[Enedwaith]] at the Crossing of Tharbad, which was only lightly held.<ref name="GC"/>

Whether Tharbad's defences - which presumably consisted of the most northerly of the Gwathló's river forts - were overcome is uncertain, but Tharbad did become the site of [[The Battle of the Gwathló]], where after having his army caught in the rear by [[Ciryatur]], who had hurried up the Gwathló from [[Lond Daer]], "Sauron was routed utterly.."<ref name=UT/>

Tharbad is not mentioned in surviving records for more than 1500 years after the war: the whole region was largely ignored by the elves and the Númenóreans following the destruction of Eregion and the forests "and the continued hostility of the surviving natives."<ref>{{HM|PM}}</ref>

The site of the ford became very important after the founding of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in {{SA|3320}}, however, and saw extensive development:

''In the early days of the kingdoms the most expeditious route from one to the other (except for great armaments) was found to be by sea to the ancient port at the head of the estuary of the Gwathlo and so to the river-port of Tharbad, and thence by the road.''<ref name="GC"/>

A need had arisen "..to undertake the great works of drainage and dyke-building that (would make) a great port on the site where Tharbad stood.."<ref name=UT/>

The ford was deepened to receive sea-going vessels, and the massive fenlands above it were extensively drained, until a much smaller Swanfleet was all that remained. Tharbad's new river-port was spanned by a bridge, the immense labour of which "was shared by the North and South Kingdoms", and included "a fortified town and haven about the [[Bridge of Tharbad|great bridge]] over the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]]."<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

These fortifications around the town were "raised there on great earthworks on both sides of the river..", and '[[Greenway|The Great South Road]]', which was built at the same time to connect the two nations, passed across the bridge via "long causeways that carried the road to it on either side across the fens.."<ref name=UT/>

===Third Age===
Some things did not change, however: Tharbad was the only settlement of Númenóreans in [[Enedwaith]], because the area beyond the fortified town "was of little concern to them, except for the patrolling and upkeep of the Great Royal Road". To this end, "A considerable garrison of soldiers, mariners and engineers [were] kept there until the seventeenth century of the Third Age.."<ref name=UT/>

From about {{TA|1150}}, it is recorded that a tribe of hobbits migrated to the fens above Tharbad, and spread onto the land along the Causeway south-east of the town over several centuries, but they left around {{TA|1630|n}};

''..because the land and clime of Eriador, especially in the east, worsened and became unfriendly.''<ref>{{HM|AA}}</ref>

Their departure and the deterioration in the weather occurred around the time of the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636|n}}, which almost completely depopulated [[Cardolan]], one of Arnor's 'successor states' with whom Gondor shared Tharbad. Cardolan's few surviving [[Dúnedain]] - including those in Tharbad - fled west to [[Arthedain]]. Gondor too was devastated, and in the years following the Plague, traffic along the road through Tharbad would have declined considerably, as "many parts of Eriador (had become) desolate.":<ref name=LR>{{HM|LR}}</ref> little wonder that "from then onwards, the region fell quickly into decay.."<ref name=UT/>

Survivors of the Plague did remain in Tharbad, and the Great (now Old) South Road continued to be an important trade route for another 350 years until the fall of Arthedain in {{TA|1974|n}}, and the end of the 'days of the Kings' in Gondor 76 years later. From {{TA|2050|n}}, the nearby native [[Dunlendings]], as well as the people left in Tharbad no doubt;

''..ceased in fact to be subjects of Gondor; the Royal Road was unkempt in Enedwaith, and the Bridge of Tharbad became ruinous, and was replaced only by a dangerous ford.''<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Tharbad was still inhabited for another 862 years, despite the absence of any sort of central government, presumably by a people akin to the [[Bree|Bree-men]] and [[Dunlendings]]. During this period, the decrepit remains of the Great South Road above Tharbad became known as 'The Greenway', even after Tharbad itself was finally "ruined and deserted"<ref name=LR/> in {{TA|2912|n}}, when great floods devastated Enedwaith following the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]].

By the time of [[The War of the Ring]] a century later;

''When [[Boromir]] made his great journey from Gondor to Rivendell - the courage and hardihood required is not fully recognized in the narrative - the North-South Road no longer existed except for the crumbling remains of the causeways, by which a hazardous approach to Tharbad might be achieved, only to find ruins on dwindling mounds, and a dangerous ford formed by the ruins of the bridge, impassable if the river had not there been slow and shallow - but wide.''<ref name="GC"/>

Others occasionally crossed the ruined bridge - at their peril - including the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], servants and spies of [[Saruman]], as well as the [[Rangers of the North]] who sought [[Aragorn]] in Rohan in {{TA|3019|n}}.

In the early [[Fourth Age]], the "ruined town"<ref name=LR/> was probably rebuilt and resettled at last, both by the Rohirrim - who colonized Enedwaith and "multiplied exceedingly"<ref name=LR/> - and the [[Reunited Kingdom]], which began to repopulate Eriador.

==Etymology==
''Tharbad'' is a [[Sindarin]] name glossed as "road-crossing",<ref>{{HM|UI}}. p. 15</ref> composed of the elements ''thar'' ("across, over") + ''pad'' ("walk, step" or "track, road"). Its original meaning is said to have been "the Stepping Stones".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 34</ref>
