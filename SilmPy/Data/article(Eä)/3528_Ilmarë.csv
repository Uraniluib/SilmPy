'''Ilmarë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈilmare]}}) was one of the chiefs of the [[Maiar]], and the handmaiden to Queen [[Varda]]. 

She is only mentioned briefly in the ''[[Valaquenta]]'', where Ilmarë is described along with the Maia [[Eönwë]] who was the banner-bearer and herald of King [[Manwë]].<ref>{{S|II}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the early stages of the [[legendarium]], Ilmarë (then called '''Erinti''') was the daughter of [[Manwë]] and Varda, but the concept of the Valar having [[Valarindi|children]] was abandoned and Ilmarë became Varda's handmaiden. <ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 58</ref> 

==Etymology==
Her name may be related to one of the [[Quenya]] words for "Starlight".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[GIL]]</ref> Christopher Tolkien has noted that ''Ilmarë'' is related to such words as ''[[Ilmen]]'' and ''[[Ilmarin]]''.<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''ilm-''</ref>
