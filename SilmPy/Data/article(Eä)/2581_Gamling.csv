'''Gamling''' (late [[Third Age]]) was a man of [[Rohan]], probably [[Erkenbrand]]'s lieutenant,<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 157, entry "Gamling"</ref> and the leader of the watchers of [[Helm's Dike]].<ref name="Helm">{{TT|III7}}</ref>

==History==
An old man during the [[War of the Ring]], Gamling was still a commanding presence at the time of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. During the battle Gamling was the first to realize that [[Orcs]] had penetrated [[Helm's Deep|the Deep]] through its culvert, and he led the counterattack himself.

Gamling seems to have been brought up in the western valleys of Rohan; he understood the tongue of [[Dunland]] that was still spoken in those regions.<ref name="Helm"/>

When the [[Deeping Wall]] was taken, Gamling was one of those swept back into the narrows.  When the battle was over Gamling, [[Éomer]], [[Gimli]] and others came forth from the caves.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Gamling translates to "old man" from the [[Old English]] term, "gamol", meaning "old, aged, ancient", but only found in Old English in verse-language<ref name="N">{{HM|N}}, p. 758</ref>

Gamling is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be ''Gameling''. It would be one of the words and names that hobbits recognized as similar to [[Hobbitish]] (like ''[[Shadowfax]]'' or ''[[Gríma|Wormtongue]]'').<ref name="N"/>

==Inspiration==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Gamling.jpg|thumb|right|Gamling in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]
Tolkien noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem ''The Tale of Gamelin'' (inspiration of Shakespeare's ''[[Wikipedia:As You Like It|As You Like It]]'')<ref name="N"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Patrick Barr]] provided the voice of Gamling.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Gamling was played by New Zealand actor [[Bruce Hopkins]]. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to [[Théoden]].

'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''
:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Gamling's speech at the departure from Edoras is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by [[Tom Kane]].
