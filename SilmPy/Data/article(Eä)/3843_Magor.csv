'''Magor''' (born {{FA|341}}) was [[Malach]]'s youngest child and only son, and Magor in turn was the father of [[Hathol]].  He served no Elf-lord. Furthermore, Magor had only one sister'' [[Adanel]]'' who was elder to him.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) House of Hador''</ref>

He led a part of his [[House of Marach|father's people]] away from [[Hithlum]] and southward down the [[Sirion|River Sirion]]. They settled among the southern foothills of the [[Ered Wethrin]], that formed the southern wall of Hithlum.

Magor's grandson [[Hador]] and his people returned over the mountains and entered the service of the Elven [[Noldorin]] High-king [[Fingolfin]], and Magor's grandson was soon made [[Lord of Dor-l√≥min]]. From Magor's famous grandson his people took Hador's name and re-named the House of Marach to the [[House of Hador]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>
