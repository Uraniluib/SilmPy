'''Rohan''' was a [[Men|Mannish]] kingdom on the northern borders of [[Gondor]]. It was the territory of the [[Rohirrim]], a people of herdsmen and farmers. Well-known for their [[horses]] and cavalry, they were Gondor's most important ally. 

== Background==
In the 1200s of the [[Third Age]], the Kings of Gondor made close alliances with the [[Northmen]] of  [[Rhovanion]], a people akin to the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]] (later the [[Dúnedain]]) from the [[First Age]]. In the 2000s, a remnant tribe of such Northmen that called itself the [[Éothéod]] moved from the valleys of [[Anduin]] to the north west of [[Mirkwood]], clearing out what remained of the recently defeated witch kingdom of [[Angmar]], east of the [[Misty Mountains]].  

In the meantime, the Gondorian province of Calenardhon was deserted by the [[Great Plague]] and during the [[Watchful Peace]] and local chieftains, such as [[Dunlendings]] gained control.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> During the time of [[Cirion]] the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]], Calenardhon was overrun by the [[Balchoth]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl]]
In {{TA|2509|n}}, Cirion sent summons to the Éothéod for aid in stopping a combined invasion of Men from the north east of Middle-earth, and [[Orcs]] from the [[Misty Mountains]]. [[Borondir]] reached [[Eorl the Young]], king of the Éothéod, who answered the summons, and arrived unexpectedly at a decisive [[battle of the Field of Celebrant]].

As a reward, Cirion invited Eorl on [[Amon Anwar]], over the [[tomb of Elendil]] and he swore mutual alliance and cooperation between the two peoples. The Steward also gave Eorl the deserted but fertile area of Calenardhon to take as their own and repopulate.

==History==
Eorl moved his people there driving out the Dunlendings who attempted to repopulate it without Gondor's consent. Eorl also built the first city of Rohan, [[Aldburg]]. Eorl lost his life fighting the [[Easterlings]] in [[the Wold]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref> Migration was continued to the days of second king [[Brego]] who defended the borders against the Dunlendings and Easterlings, and drove the remaining [[Orcs]] and [[Balchoth]] off the Wold. Brego also built the Golden Hall of [[Meduseld]], and made [[Edoras]] the capital of Rohan.

King [[Aldor]] was the founder of a golden age in Rohan's history, during which he completed Rohan's conquest east of the [[Isen]] and the [[Rohirrim]] increased greatly in numbers, who even settled valleys of [[Ered Nimrais]] including [[Harrowdale]]. It was he who succeeded in driving all the remaining Dunlendings from his realm. Rohan continued to prosper during [[Goldwine]]'s rule; but as the guard of the borders lessened, the Dunlendings slowly began to return to northern [[Westfold]], settling the area around the (friendly to them) [[Ring of Isengard]] and the southern eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]]<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>. A powerful Dunlendish force had been established, and King [[Déor]] was forced to ride northward from Edoras, ultimately to defeat his enemies but he was unable to recapture the Ring of Isengard. The following years the Dunlendings harassed and mingled with the Rohirrim.

The first line of kings lasted for 249 years, until the ninth king [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. In {{TA|2758}}, Rohan was invaded by Dunlendings under [[Wulf]], son of [[Freca]], of mixed Dunland and Rohan blood. The King, Helm Hammerhand, took refuge in the [[Hornburg]] until reinforcements from Gondor and [[Dunharrow]] (a refuge of the Rohirrim) arrived a year later and defeated the invaders. In a daring raid [[Fréaláf]] recaptured Edoras, and managed to reclaim it. He eventually drove the Dunlendings back across the rivers Isen and Adorn, freeing all of Rohan. 

The Rohirrim now kept a strong force in north [[Westfold]], however at some time King [[Folcwine]] would need the help of Gondor to drive some of them from the area.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref> He was successful but the people who remained were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

It was soon after this that [[Saruman]] arrived and took over [[Isengard]], and was welcomed as a strong ally, since it would take Rohan close to 200 years to recover its strength after the invasion. 

As Rohan was still recovering from the war with the Dunlendings, hostilities remained at the western borders. For two generations, during the coincidental [[War of Dwarves and Orcs|conflict]] many thousands of [[Orcs]] tried to claim a refuge in the [[White Mountains]] and troubled the Rohirrim; [[Brytta]] fought them off, and when he died it was believed Rohan was free of Orcs; they were not entirely driven from the White Mountains until {{TA|2864}} by [[Folca]].

During [[Thengel]]'s reign, a mysterious Northerner calling himself [[Thorongil]] entered his service, and rode with him for some time. 

Around {{TA|2960|n}} Saruman started to harass Rohan and in {{TA|3014|n}}, he began using his influence to weaken the King, [[Théoden]], as part of a campaign to invade or take over the kingdom. In {{TA|3019|n}}, he launched a full-scale invasion of Rohan, with victories; (Théoden's son, [[Théodred]] was killed during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]) and defeat at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], where the [[Huorns]] came to the aid of the Rohirrim. 

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Pursuit in Rohan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Pursuit in Rohan'']]
On the heels of this victory, [[Théoden]] rode with an army to [[Minas Tirith]] and helped break its siege in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was slain. [[Éomer]], the nephew of King [[Théoden]], then succeeded to the throne, beginning the third line.  [[Éomer]] rode with the armies of [[Gondor]] to the gates of Mordor and took part in the final battle with the forces of [[Sauron]], who was defeated when the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] was destroyed.

The rule of the Stewards of Gondor was now over. King Éomer and the new king of Gondor, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] (Aragorn), renewed their oath of alliance, and reaffirmed Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. But though Sauron had perished Éomer often fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and went with [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] far into the East and South. He was known as Éomer Éadig, or "the Blessed", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.

After the downfall of [[Sauron]], [[Gimli]] led a party of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to Aglarond, the [[Glittering Caves]] of the [[White Mountains]] within the realm of Rohan, of which there was an entrance in [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

== Description ==

The borders of Rohan were the river [[Isen]] in the west, bordering [[Saruman]]'s [[Isengard]]; the river [[Adorn]], a tributary of Isen, also in the west, forming the border with the unfriendly [[Dunlendings]]); the [[White Mountains]] in the south; the [[Mering Stream]] in the southeast, at the border between Rohan and Gondor; the Mouths of [[Entwash]] in the east; and the [[Limlight]], a tributary of the [[Anduin]] as the northern border.

The most significant feature of Rohan's geography was the river [[Entwash]], which divided the country between [[Eastemnet]] and [[Westemnet]], itself divided as [[Eastfold]] and [[Westfold]]. Other lands were [[the Wold]], the [[Folde]], the [[Downs]] and the [[Undeeps]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Riders of Rohan.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Riders of Rohan'']]
The Rohirrim found abandoned Gondorian fortresses and refuges in the White Mountains, such as the [[Dunharrow]], the [[Orthanc]] and the [[Hornburg]] which they restored and used themselves. 

The capital of Rohan was the hill fort of [[Edoras]] which lay on the slopes of the [[White Mountains]]. Another large city was '''[[Aldburg]]''', the capital city of the Eastfold and original city of Eorl the Young. Other cities must have existed but are not named.

At the time of the War of the Ring, Rohan was roughly a third the size of Gondor, whose borders had slowly been shrinking for decades.{{fact}}

===Climate and countryside===
The countryside of Rohan was described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland. The lands of Rohan are frequently described as appearing like "seas of grass". Most of the Rohirrim dwelt in small villages or farms.

== Politics == 
===Military===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|''"Forth Eorlingas!"'']]
The military of the Rohirrim was commanded by Marshals. The [[First Marshal of the Riddermark]] was the highest military rank and commanded  the [[Muster of Edoras]]: Riders of the capital Edoras and the surrounding lands, including the King's Lands and [[Harrowdale]]. In his youth, King Théoden had led the Riders of the Muster of Edoras himself, so that no First Marshal was needed and at the time of the War of the Ring, there was no First Marshal. 

The Second and Third Marshals had no fixed duties, and their roles changed according to the needs of the time. The [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]] and was based in the [[Helm's Deep]] and around the War of the Ring it was filled by Théoden's son, Prince [[Théodred]]. The [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] was based at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]] and around the War of the Ring it was filled by [[Éomer]].

After the War of the Rings, the new rank of [[Marshal of the East-mark]] was created for the eastern Rohan by King Éomer. The first Rider to hold it was his lieutenant, [[Elfhelm]].

===Alliance with Gondor===
The alliance between Rohan and Gondor came into existence in the year {{TA|2510|n}} of the [[Third Age]]. In that year the [[Easterlings]] launched a massive invasion of Gondor. The army of Gondor was defeated and trapped between the Limlight and the [[Celebrant]]. Gondor, which had always been on friendly terms with the different tribes of the [[Northmen]], sent messengers to the closest tribe, the [[Éothéod]]. Although it was unlikely that the message calling for aid would come through, it did. Then [[Eorl the Young]] and his fierce Éothéod Riders unexpectedly took the field during the Battle of Celebrant and turned the tide in the favour of Gondor. As a reward [[Cirion]], the [[Steward of Gondor]], gave Eorl the depopulated province of Calenardhon for his people to settle, while fulfilling Gondor's need for a strong ally. The [[Oath of Eorl]] was sworn by both Cirion and Eorl. Neither nation has ever broken the alliance ever since. Rohan has gone through great lengths to fulfill their part of the treaty including sacrificing two of its heirs when Gondor was under threat from the [[Haradrim]] in 2885, when [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]], the twin sons of King [[Folcwine]], were killed during the Battle of Crossings of [[Poros]]. King [[Théoden]] once again honoured the alliance in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

===War with the Dunlendings===
To the west of Rohan lived the [[Dunlendings]], a native people who had been hostile against the Free Peoples for a long time. The Dunlending [[Wulf]] briefly usurped of the throne of Rohan during the long winter. Wulf, whose father was Freca, was proclaimed an enemy of Rohan, after [[Helm Hammerhand]], the current King of Rohan, struck him down with his fist. Soon Wulf defeated Rohan and the Rohirrim took refuge in [[Helm's Deep]]. While they fought, a great winter came upon them, which caused many losses from both sides. In the war both his sons were slain; [[Hama]], who went to search for food and was lost in a blizzard, and [[Haleth]], who was slain on the doors of the [[Golden Hall]]. Helm had also died from the freezing tempartures in T.A. 2795. Wulf was soon defeated by [[Frealaf]], who was [[Helm Hammerhand]]'s nephew. Frealaf became the tenth King of Rohan. 


During the [[War of the Ring]], Saruman incited them against the Rohirrim and they fought alongside the [[Uruk-hai]] in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].

===Wormtongue===

When king Théoden began to grow old, he took as an adviser [[Gríma]], later called ''Wormtongue''. Gríma quickly became Théoden's chief adviser, but unknown to all he was secretly working for Saruman. Gríma played on Théoden's fears to further weaken the strength of the king and all of Rohan, always advising retreat where an attack was needed. He may have also begun poisoning the king at this time. This nearly proved disastrous for Rohan, and also for Gondor, by robbing them of their strongest ally in the north. Gríma Wormtongue's plans were not revealed until [[Gandalf]] arrived in Edoras during the War of the Ring.

==Etymology==

The name ''Rohan'' (coined by [[Hallas]]) is [[Gondor Sindarin]], meaning "Horse-country". ''Rohan'' is a debased form of the proper [[Sindarin]] name ''Rochand'' (or ''Rochan''), containing the elements ''[[Horses#Etymology|roch]]'' ("[[Horses|horse]]") and the toponymical ending ''[[-nd|-and]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], ""[[Index questions]]"</ref><ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}, "iii. Cirion and Eorl"</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 247-8</ref>

The native name of the country was '''[[Riddermark]]''', or simply '''the Mark'''.

In a draft of ''The Appendices'', Tolkien noted that ''Rohan'' "is of [[Noldorin]] origin, a translation of the native ''[[Lōgrad]]''", having the "strictly correct form [...] ''Rochann''."<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 53</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Conceptualised as the "Horse kings of Rohan" allied with [[Mordor]] in early drafts of [[1939]], the Rohirrim took their final form in 1942 when the text of the Lord of the Rings was completed to about one third.

==Inspiration==
Several aspects of Rohan's culture and history seem to be inspired by both Goths, Scandinavians and the medieval Anglo-Saxons.

Just like the Germanic Ostrogoths, Rohirric culture was a mounted culture. It had separated from the [[Northmen]], moved south, and had settled in close proximity with a civilization. In the Goths' case it was the Byzantine Empire and in the case of the Rohirrim, it was Gondor.

Especially Hervarar saga, with its [[Mirkwood]], Gothic horsemen and shieldmaidens, appears to have inspired Tolkien when creating the Rohirrim, although he exchanged the Gothic tongue with the Anglo-Saxon.

The antipathy between the Rohirrim and the [[Dunlendings]] resembles the historical tension between the Anglo-Saxon settlers of Britain and the native Celts.
