The '''Southern Army''' was the smaller of the two armies formed by King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]], to protect his kingdom against the double threat of the [[Wainriders]] to the northeast, and the [[Haradrim]] to the south. The command of the Southern Army was given to [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], a descendant of the royal line of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
