[[File:Sara M. Morello - Caragdur - The same fate.jpg|right|thumb|"Caragdur - The same fate" by [[:Category:Images by Sara M. Morello|Sara M. Morello]]]]The '''Caragdûr''' was a black precipice of rock on the north side of the city of [[Gondolin]]. [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] was executed by being flung down the Caragdûr.  Just before his fall Eöl cried out to [[Maeglin]] and part of what he said was "here may you yet die the same death as I."<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>  Many years later, during the fall of Gondolin, Maeglin had laid hands upon [[Idril]] but was forestalled by [[Tuor]].  Tuor fought with Maeglin and cast him far out so that Maeglin's body struck thrice upon the slopes of [[Amon Gwareth]].  Although Maeglin was not said to have died falling from the Caragdûr, he did share the fate of Eöl in a nearby location.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>
