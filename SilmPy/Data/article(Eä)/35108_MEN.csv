'''MEN''' is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "go",<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42e}}, p. 32 (root appearing as "√men")</ref> or "move, proceed (in a direction intended by a person)",<ref name=VT41>{{VT|41a}}, p. 6 (root appearing as "√men")</ref> or "have as object, (in)tend, proceed, make for, go towards, go".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 165 (root appearing as "√MEN" and "√MEN-"</ref>

In his notes on a poem in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] gave the form ''men'' ("direction, region"). It was from this ''men'' + ''[[el]]'' which was invented the [[Quenya]] word ''[[Menel]]''.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 72</ref> It is not known with certainty if ''men'' here refers to a [[Primitive Quendian]] word (cf. ''[[Men (Elvish)#Elvish]]'') or to a root.
