'''Mount Rerir''' was a mountain on the western side of the [[Ered Luin]], in [[Thargelion]] (a region of [[Beleriand]]) to the north of [[Helevorn|Lake Helevorn]], and it was one of the sources of [[Gelion]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The land around the mountain belonged to [[Caranthir]], who built a fortress on its western slopes.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> The fortress was lost during [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Elven forces probably withdrew from the area after the battle, and most definitely after [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

After the [[War of Wrath]], Rerir was apparently heavily damaged, and from the [[Second Age]] onward it was but only a shadow of its former size.

==Etymology==
''Rerir'' is a name in an unknown language, and of an unknown meaning.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/1004|articlename=Re: Rerir, Asfaloth and articles|dated=June 23, 1999|website=Elfling|accessed=}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] proposes the name is [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Rerir"</ref>

==Inspiration==
Perhaps [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] re-used a name appearing in Norse mythology: in ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', ''[[Wikipedia:Rerir|Rerir]]'' is the name of the grandson of [[Wikipedia:Odin|Ódin]].<ref>{{HM|SG}}, p. 72</ref>
