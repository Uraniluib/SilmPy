The [[Livery of Elendil]] were a number of symbols used by the [[Realms in Exile]] and their decendant kingdoms, [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. It consisted of the [[Seven Stars]], the [[Crown of Gondor]] and the [[Nimloth (tree)|White Tree]]. Upon Arnor's fall and the failing of the line of the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings of Gondor]] the crown was largely dropped from usage and not until the coming of [[Aragorn]], and the raising of his banner at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], was the crown used again.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
