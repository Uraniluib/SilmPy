The '''Flame of Anor''' is some element or power obscurely referred to by [[Gandalf]] who claimed to wield it, in the face of [[Durin's Bane]]. Only speculation can be done about its meaning and nature. 

[[Sun|Anor]] is the [[Sindarin|Elvish]] name for the Sun, and so literally the "flame of Anor" would be the light of the Sun, which originated in the fiery fruit of [[Laurelin]], one of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref> Alternatively, the "flame of Anor" may refer to Gandalf's possession of [[Narya]], known as the "Ring of Fire".<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

The expression might metaphorically refer to some power wielded by the [[Wizards|Wizard]], as a [[Maiar|Maia]] and servant of the [[Flame Imperishable]]; with the pure light of the Sun as an antithesis of the "dark fire" of the [[Ãºmaiar|fallen]] [[Balrogs|Balrog]].<ref>See external links.</ref>
