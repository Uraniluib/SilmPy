'''''-në''''' is a [[Quenya]] suffix that has two meanings.
==-në<sup>1</sup>==
Used for denoting a set of something.
===Examples===
* '''carcanë''' = "row of teeth" ('''carca''' = "tooth"|[[KARAK]])
==-në<sup>2</sup>==
Evidently a nominal counterpart of the adjectival ending '''-na'''.
===Examples===
* '''carnë''' = "(round) loaf" ('''carna''' = "round"| [[KOR]])<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p.257</ref><!--This reference doesn't say anything about -në and also says that loaf is "cornë".-->
* '''sarnë''' = "strong place" ('''sarna''' = "of stone"| [[SAR]]?)
