'''Entwives''' were the mates of the [[Ents]]. The Entwives were dedicated to [[Yavanna]].<ref>{{L|247}}</ref> They had gardens in the regions later known as the [[Brown Lands]], and their agricultural knowledge was passed on to [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]].<ref name=L144>{{L|144}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[First Age|First]] or the [[Second Age]] they started to move farther away from the male Ents because they liked to plant and control small things like vegetables, grass and flowers, while the male Ents tended the larger trees of the great forest. The Entwives passed eastward over the [[Anduin]] and went to the region that would later become the [[Brown Lands]]. After [[Morgoth]] was overthrown, their gardens blossomed and they taught agriculture to the primitive [[Men]] and they honored them.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</reF>

When [[Sauron]] burned that region to stop the advance of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] down the [[Anduin]], the Entwives were likely wiped out, although some might have been captured and enslaved as agricultural workers or have escaped into the east of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=L144 /> The Ents held that the Entwives were lost.

[[Treebeard]] would tell [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that the Entwives would love their country. Indeed sometime before the [[War of the Ring]], [[Halfast Gamgee]] claimed that he saw an [[Elms|elm]]-like "Tree-Man" walking in the [[North Moors]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> However, it was never learned whether the "Tree-Man" was an Ent, an Entwife, or just a story.

==Background==
One of the primary daggers on the survival of the Entwives is found in [[Letter 144]] of ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:
{{quote|I think that in fact the Entwives had disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance ([[Second Age]] {{SA|3429|n}} – {{SA|3441|n}}) when Sauron pursued a scorched earth policy and burned their land against the advance of the Allies down the Anduin...|[[Letter 144]]}}<ref name=L144 />

In [[2017]], a [[Wikipedia:Quora|Quora]] user named Pip Willis published a partial image of a map he claimed his father drew and shared with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in [[1971]]. Willis alleges that Tolkien wrote on the map "Here may be Entwives", in an area on the east bank a southern bow of the river [[Carnen]], flowing into the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Pip Willis|articleurl=http://www.quora.com/After-Lord-of-the-Rings-was-there-any-mention-of-the-entwives/answer/Pip-Willis|articlename=After Lord of the Rings was there any mention of the entwives?|dated=22 May 2017|website=[http://www.quora.com/ quora.com]|accessed=7 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/blog/2017/05/yes-but-is-it-canon/|articlename=Yes, but is it canon?|dated=24 May 2017|website=TS|accessed=7 June 2017}}</ref>
