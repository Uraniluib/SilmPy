The '''Ered Gorgoroth''' or '''Mountains of Terror'''<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> were a mountain chain in the north of [[Beleriand]].

The Ered Gorgoroth was the southern edge of the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], and separated Dorthonion from Beleriand proper. South of the Gorgoroth lay the unpopulated land of [[Nan Dungortheb]] (the Valley of Dreadful Death).<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref> The southern wall of the Ered Gorgoroth fell in sheer precipices.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

They were named such by the [[Sindar]] of [[Doriath]] after the [[Spiders|spider]]-creature [[Ungoliant]] made it her temporary home, and spawned many evil spiders there, which wove webs that took away all light, and all the springs were poisoned.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

The Gorgoroth had no known passes, and even the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]] passed it by. In all of the [[First Age]] only [[Beren]] son of [[Barahir]] is said to have passed the mountain range, and he never spoke of this terrible journey.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Like the rest of Beleriand, the Gorgoroth were drowned during the [[War of Wrath]], although the highland of Dorthonion survived as the isle of [[Tol Fuin]].

==Etymology==
*[[Sindarin]]: ''[[ered]]'' + ''[[gorgor]]'' + ''oth''

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
The Ered Gorgoroth are in one place in ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]'' referred to as "Gorgorath" apparently in order to rhyme with "path".<ref>{{BL|Beren}}</ref> The variation is also included in the ''Beren and Lúthien'' glossary,<ref>{{BL|Glossary}}</ref> but the reason for the different spelling is not made clear.
