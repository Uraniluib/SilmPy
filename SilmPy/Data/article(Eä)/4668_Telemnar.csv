}}'''Telemnar''', {{TA|1516}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|1636}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> was the twenty-sixth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Telemnar came to the throne unexpectedly when his father [[Minardil]] was killed in a surprise raid by [[Corsairs of Umbar]].  In response, he began outfitting a fleet to reduce the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]], but this work was halted when the [[Great Plague]] struck his realm.<ref name="Elendil"/>  The King and all his children died in {{TA|1636}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> as did a large number of the people of [[Gondor]].  The [[White Tree of Gondor#Second White Tree|White Tree]] withered and died, [[Osgiliath]] was partially deserted and began to fall into ruin, and the watch on [[Mordor]] ceased.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

With Telemnar and all his heirs deceased, the Kingship passed on to his nephew [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]], the son of Telemnar's younger brother [[Minastan]].<ref name="South"/>

==Etymology==
''Telemnar'' is [[Quenya]] for "Silver Flame", from ''[[telep]]'' "silver" and ''[[nár (Quenya)|nár]]'' "flame".
