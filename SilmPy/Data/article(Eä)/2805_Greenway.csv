The '''North Road''' also '''Greenway''' was the part of the '''[[North-South Road]]''' in [[Eriador]], which connected [[Arnor]] with [[Gondor]] far in the south.
==Route==
The portion of the road which the [[Bree-folk]] called Greenway<ref name=utindex/> began at [[Fornost Erain]] in northern [[Eriador]], it met with the [[East Road]] near [[Bree]], and then continued south through [[Andrath]] between the [[Barrow-downs]] and the [[South Downs]]. After traversing [[Minhiriath]], It reached [[Tharbad]] on the [[Gwathló]], where it crossed the river.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Then it was known as the '''[[Old South Road]]'''.<ref>[[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref>

==History==
In the later [[Third Age]] after the division of [[Arnor]] [[Arthedain|in]] [[Cardolan|three]] [[Rhudaur|realms]] it became lesser used. Use of the road virtually ended after the [[Great Plague]] and [[Long Winter]] when Tharbad was abandoned and its bridge ruined, and the Old South Road to [[Dunland]] was mostly lost. The patch of the road around the [[Bree-land]] became grass-grown because of disuse and so was called Greenway.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref><ref>{{FR|South}}</ref><ref name=utindex>{{UT|Index}}</ref>

[[Boromir]] took this road, crossing Tharbad but losing his horse, on his way to [[Rivendell]]. In the Reunited Kingdom of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] the road was restored and became important again.
