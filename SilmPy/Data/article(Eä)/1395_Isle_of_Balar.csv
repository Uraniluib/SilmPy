The '''Isle of Balar''' was a refugee camp of the [[Eldar]] and [[Edain]] of [[Beleriand]].

The Isle of Balar was located in the great [[Bay of Balar]] to the south of [[Beleriand]],<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> and according to legend it was the eastern tip of [[Tol Eressëa]] which had broken off when [[Ulmo]] ferried the [[Eldar]] to [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>  In the shallow waters about the island could be found great numbers of pearls.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

Before the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Elves of Nargothrond]], with ships built by the [[Falathrim]], explored the Isle of Balar considering it as a safe haven in time of need.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref> Some companies of [[Gondolindrim]] had been also sent there by [[Turgon]] to build ships and send some messengers to [[Aman]]; but none of those ships ever arrived and few returned.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> 

During the [[Fall of the Falas]] some Falathrim survivors escaped the [[Havens of the Falas|Havens]] on ships, with [[Cirdan]] and [[Gil-galad]]; they reached Balar where they established a safe refuge, keeping also a foothold of ships at the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Hearing this, Turgon once more sent messengers there asking for Cirdan's help. Cirdan built seven ships to send to the West, but of them no news came to Balar; only one Elf, [[Voronwë]], survived and ever returned to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

The two refugee camps held close contact, and [[Círdan]] assisted [[Eärendil]] of [[Arvernien]] in building the ship [[Vingilot]] ([[Vingilótë]]), with which he sought for [[Valinor]], to ask for the pardon of the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

From there many went to [[Lindon]] until the [[Elves]] were summoned to [[Valinor]], and the [[Edain]] to the new isle of [[Númenor]].
The Isle of Balar had vanished by the Third Age, but it is not clear when this occurred.{{fact}}
