'''Calben''' (pl. ''Celbin'') was a term used amongst [[Sindar]] that lived in [[Beleriand]]. It was used of all [[Elves]] other than [[Avari]], and it included the [[Sindar]]. The term was thus equivalent to the [[Quenya]] word "''[[Eldar]]''". After the [[Laegrim]] were recognized to be from [[Lindar]]in origin, they were included in ''Celbin''. 

Since ''Calben'' was a term used only of Elves, the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of Men]] were given their own name, [[Edain]] (as they could not be called [[Morben|Morbin]], cf. this).

== Etymology ==
''Calben'', 'a light person' derives from [[Old Sindarin]] *''kalapende''. 

It is composed from [[Sindarin]] words ''[[calad|cal]]'' "light" and ''[[pen]]'' "someone, somebody".

==Cognates==
*[[Telerin]] ''[[Calapendi]]''
*[[Quenya]] ''[[Calaquendi]]'' but used in a different context.
