'''Dunlendings''', also known as the '''Gwathuirim''', were the ferocious, stunted and vicious [[men]] that lived in [[Dunland]], close to [[Rohan]]. Also called the ''Wild Men of Dunland'', they had long been enemies of the [[Rohirrim]], because they were jealous that the rich lands of the old [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] province of Calenardhon were granted by the Gondorians to the Rohirrim instead of them.
== History ==
=== Origins ===
The ancestors of the Dunlendings were also the ancestors of the [[House of Haleth|Haladin]], the second of the Three Houses of the [[Edain]] who led her people from East Beleriand to Brethil. They were a reclusive folk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the [[House of Bëor|Bëorians]] or the [[House of Hador|Hadorians]]. They kept separate from the other Men. Their language was different from the ones that used by the other Edain.

After the fall of [[Beleriand]], the survivors went to [[Númenor]] but those who didn't cross the [[Ered Luin]] settled upon either side of the [[Gwathló]] or in the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]]. In the First Age, the [[Drúedain]] lived among them and shared close relationship, more than with any other race of men.

=== Númenórean contact ===
In ancient times the peoples who were the ancestors of the Dunlendings ranged over much future [[Gondor]] and [[Eriador]], and  dwelt in the forests of the shorelands; especially those in Minhiriath, were (as later [[Gondorian]] historians recognized) akin to the Folk of Haleth. The Númenóreans treated them ruthlessly and devastated their forests. They became bitter enemies of the [[West]] ever since.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> 

During the advance of the Númenóreans, many people overcame their fear of the Elves and fled from [[Minhiriath]] into the dark woods of the great Cape of [[Eryn Vorn]]. Those from [[Enedhwaith]] took refuge in the eastern mountains that would become [[Dunland]].<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> Offshoots of these peoples survived in isolated places like the White Mountains (the [[Oathbreakers]] are akin to the ancient Dunlendings). The [[Men of Bree]] are another offshoot of the Dunlendings, who moved even further north until they reached what became the [[Bree-land]], and were absorbed into [[Arnor]].

Even so, the hostility of the Dunlendings prevented the [[Realms in Exile]] to populate permanent settlements in Enedhwaith.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #76</ref>

Some of the [[Pre-Númenóreans]] were absorbed into the population of Gondor, and some stayed in the White Mountains. There are few records of the [[Dunlendish|Dunlending language]], due to their lack of a written history and poor oral tradition.

They remained unaffected, independent and even unfriendly to the Dúnedain, holding their own manners and [[Dunlendish]] language<ref name="lang">{{App|Languages}}</ref>. However the Dunlendings also remained hostile to those with [[Orc]]-blood<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>. The Dunlendings also dwelled alongside the [[Stoors|Stoor]] Hobbits during their [[Wandering Days]] and the latter even formed a related language to theirs.<ref name="lang"/>

The Dunlendings suffered from the [[Great Plague]] less than other peoples owing to their isolation<ref name="lang"/> and were still found in the foothills of the Misty Mountains. By the time of the [[Ruling Stewards]] they ceased to be subjects of Gondor and, being surrounded by barbarous folk<ref name="GC">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>, they moved to settle the region of [[Calenardhon]] as Gondor ceased to man the garrisons during the [[Watchful Peace]].<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

=== Arrival of the Rohirrim ===

In {{TA|2510}}, Calenardhon passed to the Northern [[Eotheod]] who came from [[Rhovanion]] and the wild hillmen and herd-folk who the Dunlendings viewed as competitors and usurpers. [[Kings of Rohan|Kings]] [[Brego]] and [[Aldor]] drove the Dunlendings out of [[Rohan]] beyond the Isen until Enedhwaith. As the ensuing enmity did not concern the [[Stewards of Gondor]], the Dunlendings kept hostilities to the [[Rohirrim]] and attacked whenever the latter were weak or in trouble<ref name="Isen"/>.

After the death of King Aldor, and as [[Isengard]] became more friendly to them, the Dunlendings passed and settled northern [[Westfold]], the mountain glens around the Ring, and southern eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]], becoming openly hostile.<ref name="Isen"/> This allowed the two peoples to mingle in some peaceful circumstances; and the dark-haired Landlord [[Freca]] was said to have Dunlendish blood<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref> But the Dunlendings began raiding over the Isen during the reign of King [[Déor]], and when it became clear that the raiders were coming from near Isengard, in {{TA|2710}} Déor led an expedition to the north. He found and defeated a host of Dunlendings, but discovered that Isengard was held by hostile forces. He was unable to drive them out as [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Egalmoth]] could not send help.<ref name="Isen"/>

The worst of these incidents was when Freca's son, [[Wulf]], allied with the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] who were in turn stirred by Sauron, keeping safe his properties at [[Adorn]]. Joining his kin from outside of Rohan with enemies of Gondor that had landed in the mouths of [[Lefnui]] and Isen, Rohan was invaded from the East, the Isen and Isengard, and finally Wulf took [[Edoras]] in {{TA|2758}}. Gondor, fighting Corsair fleets, could not help<ref name="Mark"/> as the people of Rohan survived the crisis due to the leadership of King [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]], the usurping Dunlendings were reduced after the [[Long Winter]] and finished off by [[Fréaláf]]. The Rohirrim now kept a strong force in north Westfold.<ref name="Isen"/>

Eventually many Dunlendings were found later in the Westfold of Rohan, until [[Folcwine]], aided by Gondor, reconquered it.<ref name="Mark"/> But the people remaining between [[Isen]] and [[Adorn]] were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref name="Isen"/>

The Dunlendings were employed by the [[wizard]] [[Saruman]] to attack and raid the cities and settlements of Rohan. Since [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had corrupted the mind of King [[Théoden]], the fighting men of the Rohirrim were absent for the most part. As a result, the Dunlendings easily overpowered the old men and young boys who remained.

Wild Men were also present at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] (Battle of Helm's Deep), as well as [[Half-orcs]], derived from [[Orcs]] and the [[Men]] of Dunland. The fighting was vicious, but the Dunlendings surrendered after [[Gandalf]] appeared. In contrast, the Orcs fled into the forest of [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] and were destroyed by [[Huorns]].

[[Saruman]]'s defeat at Isengard put a stop to Dunlending aggression in Rohan. However, [[The Scouring of the Shire]] by Saruman, under the alias of [[Sharkey]], was carried out with the backing of a considerable number of Dunlendings.

== Names ==

A [[Sindarin]] name for the Dunlendings was ''Gwathuirim'' (''[[gwathui]]'' "shadowy" + ''[[rim]]'' "people").<ref name=n76>{{PM|XNotes}}, #76)</ref><ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en-strict.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] (accessed 31 December 2010)</ref>

==Inspiration==
It is possible that the rivalry between the primitive Dunlendings and the blond-haired, pseudo-Anglo-Saxon Rohirrim who migrated into the lands neighboring them was meant by Tolkien to be analagous to the real life conflicts that arose between the Anglo-Saxons in England and neighboring [[Celtic]] peoples.

This is supported by the fact that placenames of [[Bree-land]] like [[Bree]], [[Archet]] and [[Combe]] are Celtic. The [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[Hobbits]] (who had stayed long in [[Dunland]]), have Celtic elements in their names. Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the Bree-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.
