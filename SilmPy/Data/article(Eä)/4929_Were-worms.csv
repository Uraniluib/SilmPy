{{quote|Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the [[East]] of East and fight the wild '''Were-worms''' in the [[Last Desert]].|[[Bilbo Baggins]], from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[An Unexpected Party]]"}}

'''Were-worms''' were creatures of an unknown kind, possibly mythical and presumably related to [[Dragons]], that were said to dwell in the [[Last Desert]].<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

== History ==
The Were-worms were only mentioned once so almost nothing is known about them. It is not even certain that they actually existed — the [[Hobbits]] had a rich folklore full of fantastic creatures, and Were-worms quite possibly fall into that category.

==Etymology==
The element "were-" is a Germanic term that refers to male humans. It suggests a shapeshifting creature like the werewolf of modern-day folktales. In [[Middle-earth]], "[[Werewolves]]", such as [[Draugluin]], did not shapechange and the name perhaps refers to the size and intelligence.{{fact}}

Thus Were-worms, if they did exist, could be a [[Men|man]]-like type of Dragon, though this must remain in the realm of speculation.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest fragment of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bilbo offered to walk to the "Great Desert of Gobi and fight the Wild Wire worms of the Chinese".<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 9</ref>  In a slightly later version [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made this "the last desert in the East and fight the Wild Wireworms of the Chinese".<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 40</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Azog's forces use giant worms to tunnel underground towards the city of [[Dale]], which Azog calls "earth eaters". When the creatures appear during the [[Battle of Five Armies]], [[Gandalf]] identifies them as "were-worms".  Apparently they are only used for tunneling, not fighting, because they do not take part in the ensuing battle.
