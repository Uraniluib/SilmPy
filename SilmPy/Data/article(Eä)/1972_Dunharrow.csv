'''Dunharrow''' was a refuge of the [[Rohirrim]] hidden in the [[White Mountains]] south of [[Edoras]]<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> and fortified against attack. Dunharrow was a clifftop overlooking [[Harrowdale]], the valley of the river [[Snowbourn]]. 

In order to reach the refuge, a winding path had to be used, known as the [[Stair of the Hold]] leading to the "[[Firienfeld]]", a large grassy area for the encampment of soldiers and refuge-seekers.

Large carved stones marked the entrance to the [[Dimholt]], a natural amphitheatre, which led into the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref name="Muster">{{RK|V3}}</ref>

==History==
Dunharrow had been used as a refuge sacred place by the [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean]] [[Middle Men]] [[Oathbreakers|of the White Mountains]] during the [[Second Age]] &mdash; nearly three millennia before the establishment of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]].

Those Men of the White Mountains had lined the winding path with statues known as the [[Púkel-men]] &mdash; statues originally carved in the likeness of the [[Drúedain]].<ref name="Muster"/>

When the [[Rohirrim]] came to the region, they recognised the "heathen fane" and they used it as a refuge.

When Rohan was invaded by the [[Dunlendings]] in {{TA|2758}} some Rohirrim, including [[Fréaláf]], took refuge in Dunharrow during the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2759|n}}; Fréaláf led a daring surprise raid from Dunharrow against the Dunlendings in spring, that recaptured [[Edoras]]. 

Some [[Orcs]] who fled the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] tried to traverse Rohan and reach the [[White Mountains]]. Those invaders were hunted down by [[Brytta Léofa]]. However some were seen still lingering in Dunharrow, where King [[Walda]] was killed by an Orc in {{TA|2851}}.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

[[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and the [[Grey Company]] arrived at Dunharrow on [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} and then left at dawn the next day to take the Paths of the Dead.  [[Théoden]] and his riders (with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]) came to Dunharrow on [[9 March]] and rode out for [[Gondor]] on [[10 March|the 10th]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Tolkien made ''Dunharrow'' the Modern English form of [[Rohirric]] ([[Old English]]) ''Dúnharg'' (or ''Dūnhaerg''), meaning "the heathen fane on the hillside".<ref>{{App|E1}}, Note</ref><ref name="Nomen"/>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that he modernised the element ''haerg'' since ''harrow'' exists as an element in English place-names.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 769</ref>
