'''Star of Elendil''' or '''Elendilmir''' was the name given to two noble star-shaped white gems.  Both of these gems were set on ''[[mithril]]'' fillets.<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> Because of its association with [[Elendil]] and the royalty of [[Arnor]], it was also referred to as '''Star of the North Kingdom''' and '''Star of the North'''. 

==History==
===The first Elendilmir===
The first jewel dated back to the early centuries of [[Númenor]], and belonged to [[Silmariën]], the daughter of King [[Tar-Elendil]].  From her, it passed to her descendants the [[Lords of Andúnië]].<ref name="Gladden"/>  The last Lord was [[Amandil]], whose son [[Elendil]] escaped the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and became High King of the [[Dúnedain]] in [[Middle-earth]].  He wore the Star of Elendil on his brow in place of a crown, as did his son [[Isildur]] after him.<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Isildur had only been King for two years when he was waylaid by [[Orcs]] and lost in the [[Anduin|Great River]] in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].  When he put on [[the One Ring]] to escape from the battle he became invisible but the Elendilmir did not, blazing instead like a red and wrathful star.  Much later the Elendilmir was found by [[Saruman]]'s trackers who had been sent to find [[the One Ring]]. They did not discover the Ring but they brought to him the Star of Elendil and other things.<ref name="Gladden"/>

===The second Elendilmir===
The original Elendilmir was lost with Isildur, and so a copy was made by the elven smiths of [[Rivendell]] for his son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]]. This second Star of Elendil became the royal symbol of the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] along with the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]]. After that kingdom's fall it remained an heirloom of the [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] and kept in [[Rivendell]].<ref name=eriador/> It remained in Isildur's line down to the time of [[Aragorn]],<ref name="Gladden"/> who wore it during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]], King Elessar ordered the restoration of Orthanc and then the original Elendilmir was found. As Elessar took up the kingship of [[Arnor]] he wore the original Elendilmir upon his brow. He would only wear it again on high days, whilst on other occasions he would wear the second Elendilmir that had descended to him.<ref name="UTIsen">{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref><ref name="Gladden"/>
