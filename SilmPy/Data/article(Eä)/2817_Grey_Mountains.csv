The '''Grey Mountains''' (or '''Ered Mithrin''' in [[Sindarin]]) was a large mountain range to the north of [[Rhovanion]]. Their western end connected to the [[Misty Mountains]] at the site of [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]].

==Geography==
North of the Grey Mountains lay the [[Northern Waste]].<ref name="UTmap">{{UT|Map}}</ref> In the west, where the Grey Mountains met with the [[Misty Mountains]] rose [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]], an ancient [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] holy site and later the capital for the [[Orcs]] of the north. The eastern end of the Grey Mountains was split into two chains, and in between lay the [[Withered Heath]], where [[Dragons]] bred. After that was a wide hilly plain, beyond which lay the [[Iron Hills]]. [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain, lay south of the Grey Mountains.<ref name="UTmap"/>

From east to west the mountains stretched some 350 Númenórean Miles, and the sources of the Great River [[Anduin]], the river [[Greylin]], and the [[Forest River]] of [[Mirkwood]] arose in this range.<ref name="UTmap"/>

==History==
===Early history===
In the [[First Age]], the Longbeards established mansions in [[Moria]] and the [[Iron Hills]], and they considered the Grey Mountains, which lay between these mansions, to be within their territory. Some [[Men]]—mostly related to the [[House of Hador]] of [[Beleriand]]—settled between the Grey Mountains and [[Greenwood]], and they allied with the Longbeards against Morgoth's [[Orcs]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>{{rp|302-303}}  This alliance ended in the Second Age after [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]], which prompted the Longbeards to seal Moria. During this time, Orcs took control of the Grey Mountains.<ref name=relations/>{{rp|305}}

===Third Age===
Durin's folk started to gather in the Grey Mountains in {{TA|1981}} after a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] was awakened in their ancestral home of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which its people fled in fear. Another portion of Durin's folk lead by King [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|1999}}<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. 

Around {{TA|2000}}<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Scatha"</ref>, many centuries before Durin's Folk established a kingdom in the Ered Mithrin, [[Scatha]], a mighty [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] of the Grey Mountains and one of the greatest [[Dragons]] to infest that range of the north,  had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. He was slain by [[Fram]] son of [[Frumgar]] in the early days of the [[Éothéod]]. His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the [[Éothéod|Men of the Éothéod]] and the [[Dwarves]] of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." It was rumoured that for this insult the Dwarves killed him.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

[[Thráin I]] re-established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] but [[Thorin I]] went to the Grey Mountains where most of the Dwarves gathered.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Nearly six hundred years later, [[Dragons]] began afflicting the Dwarves.  In {{TA|2589|n}} [[Dáin I]] was slain by a Dragon and the Grey Mountain strongholds were abandoned after the [[Wars of the Dwarves and Dragons]].  About {{TA|2480|n}} [[Orcs]] had begun to infest the [[Misty Mountains]]<ref name="TA"/> and spread to the Grey Mountains, such that by {{TA|2941|n}} [[Gandalf]] the Wizard could say that the range was "simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description".<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  However, after the [[Battle of Five Armies]] the number of [[Orcs]] in the Grey Mountains were greatly reduced (some three parts of them had perished).<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

There still was a remnant of the Dwarves in the Ered Mithrin after the core of the population left<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>, but were probably few; working whatever mines they could hold from the Orcs and Dragons.

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Ered Mithrin is an area in "The Dwarf-holds" region. The area consists of the southern slopes of the mountains and the land north of [[Mirkwood|Eryn Lasgalen]], and is accessed by a road going through the [[Dale]]-lands west of Erebor. The Grey Mountains have been settled both by the Longbeards and by a house of Easterling dwarves known as the "Zhélruka". They are now inhabited by many lesser [[Dragons|Dragon-kind]] as well as the true Dragons "Etterfang Foulmaw", Smaug's sister, and "Hrímil Frost-heart". Orcs and Trolls from Gundabad can also be found there.
