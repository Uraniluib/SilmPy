'''Harad Road''' was the long road that connected [[Ithilien]] and [[Harad]].
==Course==
It ran southward through [[Ithilien]], crossing the [[Poros]] at its [[Crossings of Poros|Fords]], and then out across [[South Gondor]] to the ford across the [[Harnen]] and beyond to the far lands of [[Harad]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
It's possible that the Road was built or first used by the [[Gondorians]], as [[Gondor]] extended its power to the south in the early [[Third Age]].<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Harad Road"</ref>

The southernmost part of the Road is not clear,<ref>{{HM|FR}}, [[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref> perhaps indcating that in the later years, as Gondor's power diminished, it fell into disuse and had disappeared.<ref name=guide/>
