==History==

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]] fled the pursuing [[Valar]] northwards through the barren and cold land of [[Araman]], traversing Oiomúrë and the Helcaraxë in order to reach [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=S9/><ref name=MR/>

The [[Noldor]] led by [[Fingolfin]] during their [[Flight of the Noldor|Flight]] possibly as well passed through Oiomúrë on their march to [[Beleriand]] from [[Valinor]] through the Helcaraxë.<ref name=Arda/><ref name=S9/>

==Origin==

[[Robert Foster]] has suggested that the mists of Oiomúrë may have been caused by "''contact between the [[Helcaraxë|Grinding Ice]] and warmer sea water.''".<ref name=Foster/>
