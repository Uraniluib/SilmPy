'''Bree''' was a village in [[Middle-earth]], east of [[The Shire]] and south of [[Fornost Erain]].
==Geography and description==
Directly west of Bree were the [[Barrow-downs]] and the [[Old Forest]]. Bree was the chief village of [[Bree-land]], a small wooded region near the intersection of the main north-south and east-west routes through Eriador. Bree-land was the only part of Middle-earth where [[Men]] and [[hobbits]] dwelt side by side and Bree had a large population of Hobbits.

The village was built under and around a part of the [[Bree-hill]] and was surrounded by a deep ditch and a hedge. The great [[East Road]] passed through this hedge on its western side, and the southern corner where the hedge and dike met the sides of the hill. At both of these points stood a gate that was closed and guarded after nightfall. The [[West-gate of Bree]] was guarded by one [[Harry Goatleaf]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Pony">{{FR|I9}}</ref>

Buildings were built on both sides of the road, and some, like ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'', near the slopes of the hill. The hill itself was burrowed by [[Hobbit-holes]].

==History==
The [[Bree-land]] area was settled in the [[Second Age]] by [[Men]] from [[Dunland]]. Surviving the wars and chaos of that time, it became part of the kingdoms of [[Arnor]], and then [[Arthedain]] (though the region from Bree to [[Weathertop]] was claimed by [[Cardolan]]).<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> Bree was by its nature a trading community, due to being located at the major crossroads of the [[East Road]], which ran from the Blue Mountains and the coast to [[Dale]] in the far East; and the old north-south road between Arnor and [[Gondor]].

Around {{TA|1300}} Bree, as well as [[Staddle]], saw the arrival of the [[Hobbits]] who were fleeing from [[Angmar]]. In {{TA|1601}} a large population of Hobbits left Bree and went west beyond [[Baranduin]] and founded a new country within Arthedain, [[The Shire]].<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref>  

After the [[Fall of Fornost]] and Arnor, the north-south road had fallen out of much use and was more commonly referred to as the [[Greenway]] due to its disrepair.  Trade had of course drastically declined in the thousand years since but Bree maintained a certain independence and continued to thrive without any central authority or government, with the unknowing protection of the [[Rangers of the North]].  Even at the end of the Third Age Bree remained relatively prosperous. Bree was the most westerly settlement of men in all Middle-earth by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] and had a sizable Hobbit population. Thanks to its location on major trade routes, one could encounter travelers from all sorts of distant lands in a bustling Bree inn.  The [[Rangers of the North]] also were known to stop in Bree for resupply.

Bree is the place where seemingly by accident, [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] met on [[15 March]] {{TA|2941}}. They were both thinking about the same problem: the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] at the [[Lonely Mountain]]. The meeting led to the undertaking of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which resulted in the death of Smaug and the finding of [[the One Ring]] by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. 

In the night between the [[29 September|29]] and the [[30 September]], {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins]] met [[Aragorn|Strider]] at the largest inn in Bree, [[The Prancing Pony]], owned by [[Barliman Butterbur]]. The inn was raided by servants of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], forcing the retreat of Frodo and his companions. 

Bree was raided by [[ruffians]] during the [[War of the Ring]], leaving several Men and Hobbits dead. When [[Travellers|Frodo and his companions]] returned in [[28 October]], {{TA|3019}}, returned to Bree, it seemed like most of the worst had passed.  Barliman Butterbur explained to the Hobbits that none of the Bree-landers ever realized how much the Rangers of the North had done for them, but after they all left (to fight in the War of the Ring in the south) all sorts of ruffians and highwaymen and wolves had encroached on the land.  The Bree-landers had survived by throwing up some hasty defenses and posting watchmen, but trade had dropped off to almost nothing as they barricaded themselves within their town walls.  The Hobbits assured Butterbur that [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], known to him as his former customer "Strider", had now been crowned King and would soon venture north to restore order.

Presumably, Bree was re-absorbed into the revived Arnor and [[Reunited Kingdom]] of Aragorn, with increased trade allowing Bree to become more prosperous than in generations.

==Etymology==
The name ''Bree'' means "hill" in [[wikipedia:Brythonic languages|Brythonic]], a [[Celtic]] language, referring to the fact that the village of Bree and the surrounding Bree-lands were centered around a large hill. According to [[Tom Shippey]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was inspired by the actual town of [[wikipedia:Brill|Brill]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bree map.gif|thumb|right|Map of Bree in [[The Lord of the Rings Online]].]]
With the absence of [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Barrow-downs]] in most adaptations, the distance between Bree and the Shire seems shorter than it really was.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:After leaving the [[Old Forest]], the Hobbits appear in the Prancing Pony without delay or introduction. The rooms were raided by [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] rather than servants of them.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Here too, Bombadil and the Barrow-downs were omitted. After taking a short walk through Bree, the hobbits enter the Pony. Merry goes out for a walk, and is found by [[Bob]] the ostler. Once again, it is the Ringwraiths rather than servants of them who raid the Pony. 

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''
:Frodo and his companions arrive at Bree almost immediately after the scene in which they leave the Shire. All are present in Strider's room when the  Ringwraiths crash the gate, trample the gatekeeper, and raid the Prancing Pony.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The role of Bree is greatly expanded, due to the interactiveness of the medium. It is the place where the Hobbits meet Strider, and the player shifts perspective. Strider searches the streets of Bree for Merry and materials to make decoys for (once again) the Ringwraiths to slash, while the streets are crowded with robbers and wolves.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Bree is one of the major cities in the north, located in Bree-land. It faces threats from several fronts: [[Sharkey]]'s brigands have already began making their way into [[Bree-land]], the [[Barrow-downs]] are stirring following the passage of the [[Nazgûl]] and a small band of [[Orcs]] has made their way from the [[North Downs]]. The citizens of Bree know more of the bigger world than [[The Shire|Shire]] dwellers, but are still oblivious to the dangers they could face. The town's mayor and the watchers don't trust the [[Rangers of the North]], insisting they can manage their own affairs. Later, during the winter of {{TA|3019}}, Bree is overrun by Sharkey's Brigands and [[Half-orcs]] and has to be liberated by Free Peoples - an event references as "Thievery and Mischief" by [[Barliman Butterbur]] later.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] visit Bree in the beginning of the game, just a few days before [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] reached the town. They meet with [[Aragorn]] in the [[Prancing Pony]].<ref name="Prologue">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>
:Bree is protected by a dike and hedge and can be entered through two of its gates.<ref>[http://www.warinthenorth.com/ The Lord of the Rings: War in the North's Official Site], [http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/the-game/locations Locations], Bree (accessed at [[14 September]], [[2011]])</ref> The most important structures in Bree are the Prancing Pony, [[Elmund Brushwood]]'s smithy and [[Adalgar Oldbank]]'s shop. Several characters appear in Bree: [[Otto Aster]], [[Harley Bramble]], Elmund Brushwood, [[Barliman Butterbur]], [[Grof]], [[Tedder Hedgerow]], Adalgar Oldbank and a [[Southerners|Southerner]], as well as several unnamed [[Bree-landers]].<ref name="Prologue"/>

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:The opening scene takes place in Bree - once again featuring a cameo from [[Peter Jackson]] eating a carrot (see [[Albert Dreary]]) - where [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] meet in the Prancing Pony. Gandalf tells Thorin of his meeting with [[Thráin]], his worries about [[Smaug|the dragon]], and his wish to see Thorin retake the [[Lonely Mountain]]. Gandalf convinces Thorin that they need [[Bilbo Baggins|a burglar]] to retrieve the [[Arkenstone]] in order to summons the "Seven Armies" of the [[Dwarves]].
