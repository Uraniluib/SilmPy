'''The Water''' or the '''Shire-water'''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p.66</ref> was the main river of [[the Shire]], a tributary of the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]].

The valley it formed was the [[Water-valley]] and a portion of the [[East Road]] ran parallel to the Water, along that valley.<ref name=Part/>

==Geography==
The Water arose to the north-west of [[Needlehole]], and a little to its south formed [[Rushock Bog]].<ref name=Part>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  Before flowing through [[Hobbiton]] the Water was quite narrow and easily crossed by a plank bridge, and was shadowed by alder-trees.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>  From there, it flowed through [[Hobbiton]] and into the [[Bywater Pool]] at [[Bywater]], where it was joined by a stream from the north. From then on, it flowed eastward alongside the [[East Road]], which ran through the valley of the Water. It divided into two streams north of [[Frogmorton]] creating a watery region. It joined the [[Brandywine]] just north of the [[Brandywine Bridge]].<ref name=Part/>

==Inspiration==
The naming of the Water may be a parody of some sorts of Celtic hydronyms that mean simply "river" or "water".<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', pp. 65-68.</ref>
