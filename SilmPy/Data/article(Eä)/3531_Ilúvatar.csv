'''Eru Ilúvatar''' or '''The One''' is the single omniscient and omnipotent creator. He has been existing eternally in the [[Timeless Halls]] and possesses the [[Flame Imperishable]] in his spirit which kindles existence from nothingness.

== The Creator ==
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Melkor Weaves Opposing Music.jpg|thumb|left|Eru during the [[Great Music]].]]
Eru created the [[Ainur]] before anything else, whom He kindled with the Flame Imperishable. Each Ainu came from a part of His mind. To further their comprehension, he presented his thought in the form of music, and listened as the Ainur picked up his themes and elaborated on them, slowly learning to sing in harmony with each other. Eventually he showed them his greatest theme, and made them sing it in harmony and develop it with newly granted powers. This was the [[Music of the Ainur]].

Out of this great music, Eru showed them the [[Vision]] which showed vast halls of spaces and stories unfolded in the deeps of Time, and some Ainur were drawn to it. Eru said "''[[ea (verb)|eä]]''" ("let it be") and thus [[Eä]], the universe, was created.<ref>{{S|Ainu}}</ref>

==The God==
The Ainur entered Eä and shaped the world according to the Music. Eru delegated most direct action within [[Eä]] to the Ainur, including the shaping of the Earth ([[Arda]]) itself.<ref name=S1>{{S|1}}</ref>

The Ainur were not omniscient and there were some things beyond their comprehension; those were the creation of the [[Elves]] and [[Men]], who are directly the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] (''[[Eruhíni]]'') created without the delegation of the Ainur. Other things known by Eru alone are their destiny, and [[the End]] itself.

The activities of Eru in regard to the life of Arda or Eä are not clear. [[Manwë]] was the [[Wikipedia:vicegerent|vicegerent]]<ref name=S1/> of Eru on Arda and it is known that he sought for his consent several times. Instances of Eru's direct intervention were:

*Sanctified the creation of the [[Dwarves]] by [[Aulë]], giving them life and sapience, and were his "adopted" Children.
*At the behest of [[Yavanna]], He allowed the [[Ents]] into being.<ref name=aule>{{S|Aule}}</ref>
*The creation of his Children, the [[Awakening of the Elves]] and [[Awakening of Men|Men]].
*The [[Changing of the World]] something that the Valar themselves could not have done.<ref>{{S|Akallabêth}}</ref> 
*Several coincidences and signs of higher providence throughout history, such as [[Bilbo Baggins]] finding the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{FR|I2}}, Gandalf: "Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of [Sauron]. [...] Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by [Sauron]. In which case you also were meant to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought"</ref>
*The resurrection of [[Gandalf]] after he was killed by [[Durin's Bane]], something that could only be done by an Authority higher than the Valar.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref>

According to ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]'' Eru would someday enter Eä to save his Children. It is said that after the end of days, Eru will unite the Ainur and the Children of Ilúvatar to create a music even greater than the one of creation.
===Worship of Eru===
{{quote|For that name we do not utter ever in jest or without full intent|[[Finrod Felagund]]<ref>{{MR|P4c}}</ref>}}
Eru was considered transcendental, removed and distant from the affairs of Arda and was seldom worshiped and His name was too holy to be invoked. 

Manwë made a [[high feast]] in praise of Eru to celebrate each gathering of fruits.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> The [[Númenoreans]] worshiped Eru in the [[Three Prayers]] held during the course of a [[coranar|year]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> 

[[Fëanor]] swore [[Oath of Fëanor|his Oath]] in the name of Eru.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> [[Elendil]] bound the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] with an oath to Eru; the next known instance when a Man invoked Eru's name "who is above all thrones for ever", was by [[Cirion]], millennia later.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

==Etymology==
===Eru===
{{Pronounce|Eru.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Eru'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "He that is Alone".<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 83</ref>

===Ilúvatar===
{{Pronounce|Iluvatar.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Ilúvatar''' (pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[iˈluːvatar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[iˈluːβatar]}}) is [[Quenya]] for "the Father of All", more commonly referred to as '''[[Ilúvatar|Eru]]'''.

The name ''Ilúvatar'' is a compound of two words, ''[[ilu]]'' and ''[[ilúvë]]'' "universe" and ''[[atar]]'' "father."
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Ilúvatar appears since the earliest form of the Legendarium, in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. It is to be noted that in earlier works of the legendarium the name ''Ilúvatar'' meant "Sky-father" since the element ''il-'' refers also to the sky (cf. [[Ilmen]]), but this etymology was dropped in favour of the newer meaning in later revisions. 

In the earlier versions Ilúvatar was the main name of God used. Another name was '''Ainatar''' "Father of Gods"<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref> — the word Eru first appeared in ''[[The Annals of Aman]]''.<ref>{{HM|MR}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
Tolkien understood Eru not as a "fictional deity" but as a name in a fictional language for the actual monotheistic God, although in a mythological or fictional context. In a draft of a letter of [[1954]] to Peter Hastings, manager of the Newman Bookshop (a Catholic bookshop in [[Oxford]]), Tolkien defended non-orthodox aspects as rightly within the scope of his mythology, as an exploration of the infinite "potential variety" of God. Regarding the possibility of reincarnation of [[Elves]], Hastings had written:
{{quote|God has not used that device in any of the creations of which we have knowledge, and it seems to me to be stepping beyond the position of a sub-creator to produce it as an actual working thing, because a sub-creator, when dealing with the relations between creator and created, should use those channels which he knows the creator to have used already|Peter Hastings}}

Tolkien's reply contains an explanation of his view of the relation of (divine) Creation to (human) [[sub-creation]]:
{{quote|We differ entirely about the nature of the relation of sub-creation to Creation. I should have said that liberation "from the channels the creator is known to have used already" is the fundamental function of "sub-creation", a tribute to the infinity of His potential variety [...] I am not a metaphysician; but I should have thought it a curious metaphysics &mdash; there is not one but many, indeed potentially innumerable ones &mdash; that declared the channels known (in such a finite corner as we have any inkling of) to have been used, are the only possible ones, or efficacious, or possibly acceptable to and by Him!|J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Letter 153]]}}

Hastings had also criticized the description of [[Tom Bombadil]] by [[Goldberry]]: ''"He is"'', saying that this seemed to imply that Bombadil was God. 	 

Tolkien replied to this:	 
:''As for Tom Bombadil, I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point. [...] You rather remind me of a Protestant relation who to me objected to the (modern) Catholic habit of calling priests Father, because the name father belonged only to the First Person.''
