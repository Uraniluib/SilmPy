'''''ethir''''' is the form of two unrelated [[Sindarin]] words (homophones) with different meanings:

==Ethir.1==
"mouth of a river, estuary"

===Etymology===
It is derived from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''[[etsiri]]''<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[ET]]</ref>

It can be analyzed as ''[[ed]]'' + ''[[sîr]]'' (''s'' reduced to ''h'' because of [[lenition]]).

===Pronunciation===
There is some controversy on the pronunciation of the word regarding the digraph ''th''<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.) ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Proto-Eldarin vowels" by [[Christopher Gilson]]</ref>.

One view says that it can be viewed as a compound: ''ed/et'' + ''sîr'' would trigger a lenition ''ed/et'' + ''hîr''. If preposition and stem are understood as different entities, t/h should be pronounced separately ({{IPA|[ˈethir]}}) (like English "a''t-h''ome").

Another view would be that PQ ''etsiri'' evolved as [[Old Sindarin]] *''ett<sup>h</sup>ire''<ref>[[Didier Willis]]' ''Sindarin Dictionary'' version of 2001; containing etymological reconstructions by [[David Salo]]</ref> before simplified as ''ethir''. In that case the PQ cluster ''ts'' was directly derived as ''th'' in Sindarin. The word would be pronounced as {{IPA|[ˈeθir]}}.

==Ethir.2==
"spy"

===Etymology===
Derived from ''[[ed]]'' + ''[[tirn]]''.  Examples include ''[[Amon Ethir]]''.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
