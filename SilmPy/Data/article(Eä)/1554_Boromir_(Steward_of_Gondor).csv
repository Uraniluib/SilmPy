'''Boromir''' ([[Third Age]] 2410<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> – 2489,<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 79 years) was the eleventh [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].
==History==

Boromir was the third child of [[Denethor I]]<ref name="Elendil"/> and succeeded his father upon his death in {{TA|2477}}.  He inherited a realm under siege. [[Ithilien]] had been lost to fierce [[Uruk-hai]], and Boromir fought several extensive campaigns to win back the land. Eventually he succeeded, but Ithilien remained depopulated, [[Osgiliath]] was finally ruined and its stone-bridge was broken.

Boromir was a great captain, even the [[Witch-king]] feared him. He was noble and fair of face, a man strong in body and in will. But he received a [[Morgul-wounds|Morgul-wound]] in that war which shortened his days. He became shrunken with pain and died twelve years after his father.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

He was followed by his son [[Cirion]] at his death in 2489.<ref name="South"/>
