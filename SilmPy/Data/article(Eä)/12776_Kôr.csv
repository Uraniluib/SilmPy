'''Kôr''' was the earlier name for the hill [[Túna]].

It is featured prominently in the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales 1]]'' as the capital of the [[Gnomes]] in [[Valinor]].
==Etymology==
In the etymology of Tolkien's earliest languages, the name of the hill of Kôr refers to its roundness. It is derived from [[Primitive Elvish]] name ''Guord'' from which came [[Qenya]] ''Qora'' and [[Gnomish]] ''Gwar''.<ref name=lt6>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>
