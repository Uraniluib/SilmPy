The '''Hobbiton Road''' was a road in [[the Shire]]. It started in [[Bywater]] branching off the [[East Road]] and passed through [[Hobbiton]]<ref>[[A Part of the Shire]] map</ref>. It was lined with trees.

During [[Sharkey]]'s occupations the trees were replaced by ugly houses.
==Identification==
The Road is mentioned in the narrative but it is not marked in ''[[A Part of the Shire]]'' and therefore it is not known which portion of which road is the Hobbiton Road. [[Robert Foster]] identifies this Road as passing through Hobbiton and then around [[Hobbiton Hill|the Hill]] and on to [[Overhill]]<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry '''Hobbiton Road'''</ref>. The [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] identifies the road as "at least" the portion between Bywater and Hobbiton.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/h/hobbitonroad.html|website=Encyclopedia of Arda}}</ref>
