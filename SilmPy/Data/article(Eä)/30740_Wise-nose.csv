'''Wise-nose''' was a pony belonging to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].

==History==
Wise-nose was one of five ponies that Merry had ready for the Hobbits' journey at [[Crickhollow]]. At the home of [[Tom Bombadil]], the ponies became friends with [[Fatty Lumpkin]], a pony of Tom's. At the [[Barrow-downs]] they became so frightened that they ran off to find Fatty. Tom called them all back with the names he had given them: [[Sharp-ears]], [[Bumpkin]], Wise-nose, [[Swish-tail]], and [[White-socks]].  Eventually they all returned with all the baggage, and went back on their journey with the Hobbits.<ref>{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>

During their stay at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' the Hobbits' ponies were let out by spies to delay their departure from [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref> They ran out in the Downs to find Fatty. They stayed with Tom for a while, until he had heard news of the events at Bree. He sent the ponies to [[Barliman Butterbur]], where they stayed working for Barliman and were well cared for by [[Bob]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>
