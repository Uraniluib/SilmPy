The '''North-South Road''', also known as the '''Great Road''' and '''Royal Road''', was a major road in the [[Westlands]] built by the [[Númenóreans]] from the [[Second Age]]; it linked the northern kingdom of [[Arnor]] with the southern kingdom of [[Gondor]].<ref name=utindex>{{UT|Index}}</ref><ref name=map>{{FR|Map}}</ref> 
==Route==
[[File:Sage - Great Road.png|thumb|Course of the Great Road (highlighted with red) with its major stops.]]
It originally ran from [[Fornost Erain]] in the far north, southward for hundreds of leagues through [[Eriador]] passing by [[Bree]] (where it crossed the [[East Road|East-West Road]]) and through [[Andrath]] between the [[Barrow-downs]] and the [[South Downs]] and crossed the former [[Cardolan]] and [[Minhiriath]].<ref name=map/> Most of this road had fallen into ruins after the [[Fall of Fornost]] and the desolation of [[Eriador]]. The patch of the North Road around the [[Bree-land]] was known as the '''[[Greenway]]''' because of its disuse.<ref name=utindex/> It then crossed [[Tharbad]] on the [[Gwathló]], where it crossed the river to traverse [[Enedwaith]].<ref name=map/> From then on, the North Road became the '''[[Old South Road]]'''.<ref>[[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref>

Arching slightly towards the [[Misty Mountains]], it went through the [[Gap of Rohan]] (via the [[Fords of Isen]]) and then it was known as the '''[[Great West Road]]'''.<ref name=utindex/> After two miles it bent sharply to the south-east to meet the [[Deeping-road]] and again bent to the east and [[Edoras]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> It passed across [[Calenardhon]]/[[Rohan]] parallel to the [[White Mountains]] and eventually [[Anorien]]. It passed near [[Minas Anor]] and then, the portion known in Minas Tirith as '''[[South Road]]''',<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> passed over [[Erui]] at the [[Crossings of Erui]], and reached [[Pelargir]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Only parts of the North-South Road are taken in consideration in the narrative of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; the route is partially seen in the original [[General Map of Middle-earth]] (and then in [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''. In those earlier maps, the portion of the road from [[Enedwaith]] to [[Rohan]] is not seen, suggesting that the road was abandoned or ruined after contact and traffic was diminished.

The name '''Great Road''' in the [[Appendices]] refers to the [[East Road]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> Confusingly, the name '''Great Road''' in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' refers to the North-South Road, which appears as a whole in [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age|the map accompanying the book]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] extrapolated the course between Enedwaith and Rohan, to restore it on the new map.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref>
