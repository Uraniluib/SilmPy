'''''-lva''''' is a pronominal ending in [[Quenya]] meaning "our", of two persons where one addresses the other.<ref>{{L|205|2}}</ref> Only attested in the genitive ''[[-lvo]]'' in the word '''omentielvo'''. For this reason it has been argued{{who}} that the ending may actually be *''-lwa'', since there is some evidence that '''wo''' would change to '''vo''' in Quenya and the '''w''' of *'''-lwa''' could be derived from the dual ending ''[[-u]]''.{{fact}}
