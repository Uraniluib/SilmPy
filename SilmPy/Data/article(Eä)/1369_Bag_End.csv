{{quote|In a hole in the ground there lived a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a Hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.|Opening lines of ''[[The Hobbit]]''<ref name="Unexpected">{{H|Party}}</ref>}}

'''Bag End''' or '''Bag-End'''  was a [[Hobbit-holes|smial]] in [[Hobbiton]], the residence of the [[Baggins Family]] and later the [[Gardner Family]].

The entrance to Bag End was a perfectly round green door featuring a brass knob in the center.  The entryway was a tube-shaped hall with paneled walls and a tiled floor, furnished with carpeting, polished chairs, and an abundance of pegs for the hats and coats of many visitors.  The tunnel continued into the hill with side doors that were also round.  All of the rooms were on the same level – bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, multiple pantries, wardrobes, kitchens, and dining rooms.  The best rooms were those on the left side of the passage for they had deep-set round windows with a view of the garden and meadows beyond down to [[The Water]].<ref name="Unexpected"/>

==History==
{{quote|You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.|[[Sandyman]]<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref>|center}}

Bag End was built into [[the Hill]] by [[Bungo Baggins]], where he went to live with his new wife, [[Belladonna Took]]. The hole was largely financed by her.<ref name="Unexpected"/> The earth removed was shot over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground; this lane would thenceforth be known as "[[Bagshot Row]]".<ref name="N">{{HM|N}}, p. 763-5</ref> The hole was inherited by Bungo's son [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], who employed [[Holman Greenhand]], [[Hamfast Gamgee]],<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> and later [[Samwise Gamgee]] to tend to its gardens.

Bag End in turn was left to Bilbo's adopted heir, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], in {{SR|1401}}.<ref name="Party"/> When he too left [[the Shire]], he sold it to his cousin [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]], who had coveted it for years.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> It was used by her son [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] as he declared himself [[Chief Shirriff]]. [[Saruman|Sharkey]] also adopted the hole as his base, digging up Bagshot Row and erecting many houses in its stead. After the [[Battle of Bywater]], it was largely restored to normal, and Frodo took up residence in the hole again.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

After [[Frodo Baggins]] left [[Middle-earth]], he gave Bag End to [[Samwise Gamgee]], whose family, the Gardners, would live in it for many years.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s aunt [[Jane Neave]]'s farm was called Bag End by the locals in Dormston, Worcestershire.
{{quote|It [Bag End] was the local name for my aunt's [Jane Neave] farm in Worcestershire, which was at the end of a lane leading to it and no further...|[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|''Nomenclature'']]<ref name="N"/>}}

The name can also be seen as a pun on "cul-de-sac" (literally "bottom of the bag").<ref name="N"/>

In the books, it is supposedly a translation of the [[Westron]] ''[[Laban-neg]], [[Labin-nec]]'', which has much the same meaning, and the same relationship to the Westron form of Baggins: ''[[Labingi]]''.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]'''
:A life-sized exterior of Bag End was constructed as part of the Hobbiton set near Matamata, New Zealand. The interior sets of Bag End were built on two different scales.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Bag End is the starting point. Prior to leaving, the deed and key have to be found.

'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:Bag End is the starting point. 

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Two different maps of the Shire are used: in the evil campaign, and a map is available for skirmishes. In the former, Bag End and the Hill are located in the top left; in the latter, it does not appear.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Bag End, including surrounding environs The Hill and [[The Party Tree]], are featured in the Shire region. In autumn, during the [[Harvestmath]] festival, the basement of Bag End becomes the "Haunted Burrow," a hobbit-style haunted house.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:As with ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, ''The Hobbit'' trilogy opens with an older Bilbo in the study of Bag End. In crafting the set, the designers said they were inspired by [[wikipedia:Victorian decorative arts|Victorian aesthetics]] but chose to make the home brighter and with lighter, earthier colours, reflecting the fact this is 60 years earlier than ''The Lord of the Rings'' and home to a much younger hobbit. The pantry was designed to be overly-stocked whilst the whole home - especially the bedroom - was stuffed with plump furnishings to reflect Bilbo's "comfortable" lifestyle.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', pp. 16-20</ref>
