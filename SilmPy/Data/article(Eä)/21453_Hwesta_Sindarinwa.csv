[[Image:Hwesta sindarinwa.gif|left]]'''''Hwesta Sindarinwa''''' ("''Grey-elven hw''") is the name in [[Quenya]] of the thirty-fourth letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.  This letter is not used in written Quenya because "hw" is represented by ''[[Hwesta]]'' and no distinct sign for "chw" is needed.  Because "hw" and "chw" are used frequently in Sindarin, and ''Hwesta'' is used for "chw",<ref>{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref> this variant letter arose to represent "voiceless" '''W''' or '''HW'''.<ref>{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The additional letters''</ref> The Westron name for this letter is '''''Wh√≠''''',<ref>See [[Westron Tengwar]]</ref> which suggests that it also represents "hw" in that language.
