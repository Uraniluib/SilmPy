'''Celegorm''' was the third son of [[Fëanor]] and [[Nerdanel]],<ref name=Eldamar>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref> and a constant companion of his younger brother, [[Curufin]]. 

==History==
Born in [[Valinor]], Celegorm was a great huntsman, and was a friend of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Oromë]]. From Oromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages.<ref name=Eldamar/> He was given by the Vala the great hound [[Huan]].<ref name=Beren>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

As with the other [[Sons of Fëanor]], Celegorm was bound by his father's [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] to recover the [[Silmarils]], which had been stolen by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>  This oath caused him and his brothers to follow Fëanor back to [[Middle-earth]], taking Huan with him.  Upon arrival, and before the rising of the [[Moon]], Celegorm was the one who heard news of [[Orcs]] descending through the [[Vale of Sirion]] to attack [[Círdan]] in the [[Havens of the Falas]].  Celegrom led part of the Elven-host that fell upon the Orcs near the [[Eithel Sirion]] and drove them into the [[Fen of Serech]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

Celegorm dwelt with his brother Curufin in [[Himlad]] and fortified [[Aglon]], a pass that led northeast into [[Lothlann]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>  However, in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}} the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people<ref>{{GA|148}}</ref> to [[Nargothrond]], where their cousin [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] welcomed them.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

In {{FA|465|n}},<ref>{{GA|181}}</ref> while he and his brother Curufin lived in Nargothrond they almost took it over at the departure of Finrod Felagund.  They captured [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]], daughter of King [[Thingol]] of Doriath.  Celegorm wished to marry her, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol.  Huan, however, broke with his master and helped Lúthien escape.  He was expelled from Nargothrond with his brother at the order of [[Orodreth]].<ref name=Beren/>

Because of the deeds of Celegorm and Curufin, in {{FA|468|n}} Orodreth refused to join the [[Union of Maedhros]]<ref>{{GA|212}}</ref> before the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Celegorm fell in the [[Second Kinslaying]] in {{FA|506|n}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}</ref> when the [[Sons of Fëanor]] attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]]. Dior slew Celegorm in the halls of [[Menegroth]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Celegorm's [[father-name]] was '''''[[Turcafinwë]]''''', which in [[The Shibboleth of Feanor]] is translated as "Strong, powerful(in body) Finwë". His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Tyelkormo]]''''', meaning "Hasty-riser" a reference to his quick temper. ''[[Tyelka]]'', in [[Quenya]], is an adjective which means "swift, agile or hasty".<ref>{{PM|Feanor}}</ref> The name Celegorm is the [[Sindarin]] version of his [[Amilessë|mother-name]]. The [[Sindarin]] ''[[celeg]]'' has the same meaning as tyelka, as they are both derived from the root ''kyelek''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''''KYELEK-'''''</ref>
