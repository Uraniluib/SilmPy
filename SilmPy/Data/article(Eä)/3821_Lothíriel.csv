==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the published version of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Lothíriel and Éomer were wedded in "the last year of the [[Third Age]]".  In [[Appendix B]], "The Tale of Years" states that 3021 was the last of the Third Age,<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> and thus the wedding took place in that year.  However, in the manuscript of Appendix B that [[Christopher Tolkien]] called 'T4' (which was later shortened for the published work) the wedding of Lothíriel and Éomer was set in "3022 (or [[Fourth Age]] 1)".<ref>{{PM|Third}}, p. 244</ref>

:Lothíriel first appeared in ''[[The Road to Gondor]]'', the first book of Volume 4 of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', and can be found in the Great Hall of the Prince in Dol Amroth. 

:Denethor II proposed to Imrahil a betrothal between Boromir and Lothíriel. Because the betrothal was between close kin, it was disapproved by both Imrahil and Boromir - aswell as a part of the population - but neither dared to refuse his request. Both Lothíriel and Boromir reluctantly consented as obedient children, though both were unhappy with the betrothal.<ref name="SOS 1.10">[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: [[The Strength of Sauron]], Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 10: Keepers of History''</ref> The mariage was to be in the summer of {{TA|3018}}, but was postponed, after Boromir suddenly had to travel to [[Rivendell]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: [[The Strength of Sauron]], Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 12: The Shadow in Morthond''</ref> After the betrothal she often left Dol Amroth and had dealings with the Elves.<ref name="SOS 1.10"/> She met Dorthaneth, leader of the Avorrim, who became one of her closest friends. Dorthaneth counseled her concerning her betrotheral with Boromir and - during the [[War of the Ring]] - weapons, armies and war.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: [[The Strength of Sauron]], Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 9: A Message for Lothíriel''</ref> She mourned the death of Boromir, though she was reliefed that she would not have to marry him.<ref name="SOS 1.10"/>

:When her father answered the summon of Denethor II and marched to Minas Tirith with a large part of the army, Lothíriel was left in charge of Dol Amroth. She sent detachments of Swan-knights to [[Lamedon]] and the [[Blackroot Vale]] against her father's wishes.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: [[The Strength of Sauron]], Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 5: A Difficult Road''</ref>  She had two purposes in mind, firstly to protect the local peoples against evil and secondly as a rebellious against her father. When she learnt of the threat of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] to Dol Amroth, she recalled the Swan-knights back to protect Dol Amroth.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: [[The Strength of Sauron]], Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 11: The Swan-knights''</ref>
