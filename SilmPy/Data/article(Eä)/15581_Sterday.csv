==Etymology==
''Sterday'' represents an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form "Sterrendei", a word preserved in the [[Yellowskin]]. It is dedicated to the [[stars]].<ref name=cal/>

It is translated as "Saturday" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' but as it was the first day of the week, it corresponded more to our Monday. For this reason, The "Saturday" referred in the poem ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'', actually refers to the Hobbitish [[Mersday|Thursday]].<ref name=cal/><ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
