'''Galadriel''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ɡaˈladri.el]}}) was a [[Noldo]], one of the [[Calaquendi]], and arguably the most famous and powerful elf of the [[Third Age]].  She was one of the bearers of the [[Three Rings]], of [[Nenya]], and with it kept her realm of [[Lothlórien]] free of stain.

==History==
===Life in Aman===
When a fourth child was born to [[Finarfin]], prince of the Noldor, and [[Eärwen]], princess of the [[Falmari|Teleri]], her father named her '''[[Artanis]]''', which is "noble woman".  She was unusually tall and strong as she grew, and so Eärwen’s name for her was '''[[Nerwen]]''', "man-maiden".  Though the source of her hair colour was from her parents, it was said among the Eldar that her hair had captured the light of the [[Two Trees]] in Valinor, which resulted a unique and dazzling colour of gold and silver.<ref name=Galadriel>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> According to a legend, this is how [[Fëanor]] conceived the idea of capturing the light of the trees inside the [[Silmarils]]. Despite her mixed blood, she was identified as a princess of the Noldor, as her father was the third son of [[Finwë]], [[High King of the Noldor]].

During the [[Darkening of Valinor]], she was very independent and visionary. She swore no [[Oath of Fëanor|oaths]], but the words of Fëanor concerning Middle-earth kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.
During the troubles that followed, even though she participated in the revolt of the Noldor,<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref> she fought against Fëanor in defence of her mother's kin in the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]].<ref name=Galadriel/> Accounts suggest she travelled among the second group led by Fingolfin, which joined the battle at [[Alqualondë]] late and without knowing how it had started. Some of that group had not participated in the killing, although it is not clear who and how many. Dismayed by the Doom of [[Mandos]], her father Finarfin abandoned the march of the Noldor and returned to Valinor. But Galadriel and her brothers crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] in far north and arrived to the northern shores of [[Hither Lands]]<ref name="Sil9">{{S|Flight}}</ref>.

===Arrival to Middle-earth===
[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|left|thumb|Līga Kļaviņa - ''Love at First Sight'']]
In [[Beleriand]], Galadriel and her eldest brother [[Finrod Felagund]] came to [[Doriath]] as guests of [[Elu Thingol]], the King of Doriath. It was there she met [[Celeborn]], a kinsman of Thingol, who would become her husband and companion in Middle-earth<ref>{{S|13}}</ref>. When her brother Finrod departed to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]], Galadriel did not go with him and remained in Doriath with her husband, though she occasionally visited her brother in Nargothrond.
[[Image:Donato Giancola - Galadriel and the mirror.jpg|right|thumb|[[Donato Giancola]] - ''Galadriel and the mirror'']]
During her days in Doriath, Galadriel became friends with Queen [[Melian]] the [[Maia]], and they spoke often to one another about Valinor.<ref name="Sil15">{{S|15}}</ref> Melian was eager to learn the causes of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile of the Noldor]], but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. Eventually, however, as Melian’s guesses became more shrewd and accurate, Galadriel revealed the tale to her, though still leaving out the Oath of Feanor, the Kinslaying and the burning of the Ships at [[Losgar]].<ref name="Sil15"/> Melian was able to discern some of what was left unsaid, and still more came as rumors to Thingol’s ears. At last, egged on by the accusing words of Thingol, [[Angrod]] told all. Galadriel was not expelled from Doriath because of Thingol’s sympathy to the houses of Finarfin and Fingolfin for the wrongs they had suffered. All the same, she went to Nargothrond to live with Finrod for a time.<ref name="Sil15"/> Presumably, she returned to Doriath to live with her husband.

Galadriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the [[War of the Jewels]]. She and Celeborn survived, or even were not present in the [[Sack of Nargothrond|destruction of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495}} and [[Second Kinslaying|Doriath]] in {{FA|503}}/{{FA|506}}. It is not unlikely that after the destruction of Doriath they went to the [[Havens of Sirion]] along with many survivors of Beleriand (or even with their Telerin kin to the [[Isle of Balar]] with [[Círdan]]). Thus they even survived the [[Third Kinslaying]], and after that, the [[War of Wrath]].

After the overthrow of Morgoth, a ban was set upon her return to Aman by the Valar, but she was proud and replied that she had no interest in returning.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref>

===Second Age===
After the War of Wrath, Galadriel and Celeborn came to [[Lindon]] with the other survivors of Beleriand.<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref>They ruled over the fiefdom of [[Harlindon]], which was composed mostly of [[Sindar]], under the [[Gil-galad|High King Gil-galad]]<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref>. Eventually the couple moved to a new land called [[Eregion]] in far eastwards of Lindon.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref> It was ruled by [[Celebrimbor]], a grandson of Fëanor and distant cousin of Galadriel. They dwelt there for a time and Galadriel was probably present during the crafting of the [[Rings of Power]]. Eventually Galadriel and Celeborn made contact with the [[Nandor]] of [[Amdír]], who dwelt in a forest realm called Lindórinand (Vale of the Land of Singers) across the [[Misty Mountains]]. They crossed the [[Hithaeglir]] through [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and relocated to there, becoming great among the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. 

Celebrimbor and the jewelsmiths of [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] collaborated with [[Annatar]] on the great process of making Rings of Power.<ref name="SilV">{{S|V}}</ref> By Annatar’s help, the Elves of Eregion created many rings, but both Celebrimbor and Annatar created greater rings of their own in secret. Celebrimbor wrought the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, which were far more powerful than the lesser rings. Annatar, however, wrought [[the One Ring]]. When he placed it on his finger, the Elves were aware of his treachery, and took off their rings. Celebrimbor, afraid for his life but even more for the safety of the Three Rings, sent them to two of the [[Wise]]: [[Narya]] and [[Vilya]] for Gil-galad (who eventually gave Narya to [[Círdan]]), and [[Nenya]] for Galadriel. Very few even of the Eldar knew who hid each of these Rings. Celebrimbor was slain by [[Sauron]] not long after, and Eregion was laid waste.<ref name="SilV"/> But the Three Rings were safe. [[Image:Angus McBride - Galadriel.gif|thumb|left|250px|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Galadriel'']]
At this time, many Noldor of Sindarin speech migrated to the realm of Amdír, escaping from the destruction of Eregion, and Celeborn fortified it against Sauron's attempts to cross the Anduin. Soon thereafter, the White Council (not to be confused with the first White Council of the Third Age) was held in the newly-found realm of Imladris, where Elrond met and fell in love with Celebrían, the daughter that Galadriel and Celeborn had at some time during the Second Age.<ref name=Galadriel/>

In time [[Amdír]], King of Lindórinand, was slain in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] during the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. Celeborn may have participated in the war, but the greatest effect it had on the twain was the destruction of [[Sauron]] and the loss of [[the One Ring]]. Galadriel was now free to use her ring.

===Third Age===
When King [[Amroth]] son of Amdír perished, Celeborn and Galadriel ruled Lindórinand jointly, and were called the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]]. Galadriel planted the [[mallorn]] seeds brought with her from Lindon, the only mallorns east of the Sea, and afterwards the realm was called Lórinand (Valley of Gold) and Laurelindórinand (Valley of the Singing Gold), which through some transformations turned into the later name of [[Lothlórien]] or Lórien.  They established [[Caras Galadhon]], and the realm of Lothlórien was one of light and life.  With [[Nenya]], the Ring of Water, Galadriel made the realm of Lórien even greater. With the power of her ring, she protected it from the intrusion of evils throughout the Third Age.It was during their days of power and glory in Lothlórien that Celebrían, their only child, married [[Elrond]], a close friend of Galadriel’s and bearer of [[Vilya]] after the death of Gil-galad during the Alliance.  Celeborn and Galadriel had three grandchildren by her, one of whom, [[Arwen]], they were especially close to.  But Celebrían was waylaid and tortured by [[Orcs]] in {{TA|2509}}, and passed West over the sea.

In {{TA|2463}} the [[White Council]] was formed.  Galadriel, being one of the [[Wise]] and the greatest threat to Sauron alive, was one of the members.<ref name="SilV"/>  Celeborn may have been as well, but this is not known for sure.  She was a good friend of [[Gandalf]], and recommended that he be made head of the Council.  But this distinction fell instead to [[Saruman]], whom she distrusted. Sometime before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, the White Council began to notice a dark shadow arising in Mirkwood. When Gandalf later discovered it to be Sauron, he urged the council to drive him out. After deliberating, the council acted and Galadriel assisted them in driving Sauron out of Dol Guldur in the year 2941 of the Third Age.

[[Image:Billy Mosig - The Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Billy Mosig]] - ''The Mirror of Galadriel'']]During the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel met the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in {{TA|3019}}.  She especially was attentive to the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Frodo Baggins]], who was the bearer of [[the One Ring]].  She showed him Nenya, and let him gaze into her [[Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]] of seeing.  He offered her the One Ring, and despite the extreme temptation, she resisted it successfully.  She sent the Fellowship off on their quest furnished with [[Gifts_of_Galadriel|gifts]].  The two most important gifts she gave were to [[Aragorn]], whom she knew well and liked, and a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] named [[Gimli]].  To Aragorn she gave the [[Elfstone]], which she and her daughter Celebrían had worn. This jewel was created for her by Celebrimbor in Eregion, in remembrance of the first Elfstone, that was now lost.<ref name=Galadriel/> She was unsure as to what to give Gimli, and asked what he wanted.  After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of her hair.  Galadriel remembered the posing of a similar question by Fëanor, but had searched Gimli’s heart and knew that his intentions were pure.  She rewarded him with three strands, which he was later to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her.

Not long after the departure of the Fellowship she received the resurrected Gandalf.  She reclothed and refurnished him, giving him a new staff.  After Gandalf left, Lothlórien was subjected to three successive attacks by armies coming out of [[Dol Guldur]].  By the power of her Ring they were thrice repulsed.  Celeborn then led [[Fall of Dol Guldur|an attack on Dol Guldur]] itself.  Once the dark fortress was in the hands of the Galadhrim, Galadriel came, threw down its walls, and purified it of its evil.  It was her last act of power, for the One Ring was destroyed, and the strength of Nenya waned and eventually vanished almost completely.

===Return to Valinor===
Galadriel attended the wedding of Aragorn with Arwen, then returned to Lothlórien. But in {{TA|3021}}, two years later, she bade farewell to Celeborn her husband and went West to Valinor. With her went the other two bearers of the Rings, Gandalf and Elrond, and Frodo and Bilbo Baggins who had borne the One Ring. They passed West, and came never again to Middle-earth.  There in Valinor Galadriel must have tried to heal Frodo of his spiritual wounds.{{fact}} Whether she was successful or not is unknown. But sometime later during the [[Fourth Age]] she received Celeborn{{fact}}, her husband. And in {{FoA|120}}, it is said, she received Gimli her admirer, who was the first and only dwarf to enter Valinor.

==Characteristics==
Galadriel was very beautiful, her hair being the most notable feature about her. It reminded the Eldar of the light of the [[Two Trees]].<ref name=Galadriel/> Galadriel, at least in her earlier years, was of a somewhat proud and rebellious nature. She was free-spirited, and during her time in Aman had many dreams of wide unexplored lands. In her early youth, she was very willful and of an "Amazon" disposition; and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats.<ref>{{L|348}}</ref> Her favorite brother was Finrod, for he, too, shared this vision. She could explore the minds and hearts of others, and her gaze was seeing. It may be because of her unusual beauty and power that she became proud.

But by the Third Age she is also seen to act with wisdom and gentleness. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', she appears very gentle, firm, and wise. She was revered even more than Celeborn by the Galadhrim and all who met her.

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Galadriel.mp3|Ardamir}}
''[[Galadriel]]'' is a [[Sindarin]] name translated by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] as "glittering garland",<ref>{{L|345}}, p. 423</ref> "Maiden crowned with gleaming hair",<ref>{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref> and "maiden crowned with a radiant garland".<ref name=SApp>{{S|Appendix}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 44-45</ref> It has been suggested that ''Galadriel'' consists of ''[[galad]]'' ("light, radiance") + ''[[rî]]'' ("crown") + ''[[iell]]'' ("daughter").<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#g|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names|website= [http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com]}}</ref> Tolkien notes that the element ''galad'' had no relation to Sindarin ''[[galadh]]'' ("tree", or Silvan ''galad'' "tree"), but that such a connexion often was made and her name then was pronounced ''Galadhriel''.<ref name=SApp/><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, p. 182 (commentary to §42)</ref>

==Names==

'''''Alatáriel''''' was the [[Telerin]] [[Quenya]] name given to Galadriel by [[Celeborn]], meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland", which referred to her hair.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants'', p. 347</ref>

At the time of her birth, [[Finarfin]] named his only daughter ''[[Artanis]]''. '''''Artanis''''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈartanis]}}, stem ''Artaniss-'') was Galadriel's [[father-name]]: it means "Noble Woman" in [[Quenya]] from ''[[arta]]'' and ''[[nís]]''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod'', p. 354</ref><ref>{{MR|P3II}}, p. 213</ref>

'''Nerwen''' is the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of the [[Elves|elf]] [[Galadriel]].

According to the custom of the Elves, her mother, [[Eärwen]], waited a while to give her daughter a name. Due to Artanis's height and her great strength of body and will, Eärwen chose the name '''''Nerwen''''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈnerwen]}}), meaning 'man-maiden'. In the end, however, their daughter used neither her [[father-name]] nor her mother-name, and instead took the name by which she is known to history: [[Galadriel]].

The name “Galadriel was chosen by Artanis (’noble woman’) to be her Sindarin name, for it was the most beautiful of her names, and, chose as an epessë [after name or ‘nickname’], had been given to her by her lover, Teleporno of the Teleri, whom she wedded later in Beleriand.”<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref><ref group="note">Teleporno was the Teleri-styled named for Lord Celeborn: "“It is only of course in the late version that Celeborn appears with a High-elven, rather than Sindarin, name: Teleporno." {{UT|6e}}</ref>   

'''''Galadhriel''''' was a name occasionally, and incorrectly, used of [[Galadriel]] after she became [[Lady of Lórien]], and meaning 'tree-garland'. As the [[Lady of the Galadhrim]], whose capital was at [[Caras Galadhon]], it is perhaps understandable that her name should have become confused with the [[Elvish]] word galadh, meaning 'tree'. Nonetheless, this usage was mistaken — her true name ''Galadriel'' actually derived from the word ''galad'' ("radiant"), and the false variant ''Galadhriel'' was never used in her own country of [[Lórien in Middle-earth|Lórien]].<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''kal-''</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==

There is a bit of befuddlement and confusion in the story of Galadriel, which [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] revised multiple times. Some of the points that were revised often are the role of Galadriel in the rebellion of the Noldor, the reason why she remained in Middle-earth, and the time at which she met Celeborn. 

In the notes to ''The Road Goes Ever On'' and in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', Galadriel was one of the leaders of the revolt and followed Fëanor into Exile.<ref name="Sil9"/> She couldn't return to Valinor because a ban was set against her, and she met Celeborn in Doriath, who was one of the Sindar. This is the only version of her story that was published by Tolkien during his lifetime. 

However, there are two late essays written by Tolkien after ''The Road Goes Ever On'' and published in ''Unfinished Tales'' that contradict this. In one of them, though Galadriel revolts along with the other Noldor, she's offered the pardon of the Valar, but refuses to return to Aman nonetheless. 

In the other, later essay, Galadriel has no participation at all in the rebellion of the Noldor, but sails on her own ship to Middle-earth. She would have been allowed to sail to Middle-earth by the Valar in normal conditions, but since she did it during the disturbance of Valinor, she fell under the Doom of Mandos all the same.

In both essays, she met Celeborn in Aman. He was called in Quenya ''Teleporno'', and was a young Telerin prince, probably the son or grandson of [[Olwë]] (which would make him Artanis’s uncle or cousin)*. They eventually fell in love, and he called her in his own Telerin tongue [[Alatáriel]] (later [[Sindarization|Sindarinized]] as Galadriel and semi-[[Quenya|Quenyarized]] as [[Altáriel]]). 
It's unknown whether Tolkien would have gone ahead with this revision (possibly making a new edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On''), or if he would have felt bound by the published version. This account presents also the difficulty of Celeborn and Galadriel being so closely related (the Eldar did not marry that close). 

Another point that was revised, was the time at which Galadriel passed over the mountains of Ered Luin to enter Eriador. In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', she says that she passed over the mountains before the fall of Nargothrond and Gondolin, yet in Appendix B of The Lord of the Rings it's said that at the beginning of the Second Age she was still dwelling in Lindon, before passing over the mountains. This contradiction in the same work must have been due to a mistake during revision.

Besides this, the earlier version of the story of Amroth given in [[Unfinished Tales]], says that Galadriel and Celeborn had two children, of which one was [[Amroth]].<ref name=Galadriel/>

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Galadriel is voiced by [[Annette Crosbie]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by [[Marian Diamond]]. In addition to the Lothlórien episodes, the voice of Galadriel is heard in Shelob's Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Elrond in the final episode in the Shire, as they journey towards the Grey Havens.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Galadriel is played by [[Cate Blanchett]]. Galadriel narrates the Prologue, explaining the creation of the Rings of Power and the War of the Last Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events. 

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Galadriel, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]], is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Galadriel frequently consults telepathically with Elrond; there is an indication from the books{{fact}} that the two were able to communicate in some way, without specific reference. In the film, unlike the book, [[Galadriel]] and [[Elrond]] send an army of [[Elves]] - led by [[Haldir]] - to [[Battle of the Hornburg|Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim]]. In the DVD commentary, [[Peter Jackson]] and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves don't seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screentime and resources.  

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelob's Lair, soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him.  She is later seen leaving Middle-Earth along with other Ring-Bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Galadriel is the strongest of "Hero" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot [[Gollum]] on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to "summon" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie.
