The '''Fall of Amon Sûl''' was a siege that took place in {{TA|1409}}.

==Prelude== 
In 1409 the Witch-King of Angmar led a great host across the river [[Hoarwell]] against the land of [[Cardolan]], after being beaten back out of the lands of the [[Dúnedain]] many years before. 

==The Siege==
When the forces of Angmar reached Weathertop they besieged it, until they broke through.  The attackers subsequently burned, then razed the fortress to the ground.  King Arveleg I was killed, but some of the Dúnedain retreated and escaped with the ''[[Palantír]]'' that was stationed there.

==Aftermath==
Amon Sûl was the main defensive outpost in the [[Weather Hills]] and northern Cardolan.  With it gone the Witch-King was able to take and ravage Cardolan, as well as consolidate his new conquests in [[Rhudaur]], which his [[Hill-Men]] allies and subjects had taken, as well as launch attacks against the whole of [[Arthedain]].
      
However despite permanently ending the threat that was Cardolan, Angmar was unable to ride its momentum, and was driven away from the city of [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]] by the forces of the new King [[Araphor]] and Lord [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]].
