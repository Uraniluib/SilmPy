'''Kurúki''' was an evil magician in a preliminary sketch of the tale of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]''. When [[Nienor|Nienóri]] and her mother [[Morwen|Mavwin]] (at that point named ''Vainóni'' and ''Tirannë'') stumble upon him, he gives them a drink which causes them to forget their names and wander distraught in the woods.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 138-9</ref>
