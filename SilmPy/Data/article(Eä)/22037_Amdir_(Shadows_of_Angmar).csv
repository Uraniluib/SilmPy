'''Amdir''' is a character created specifically for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. He was a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]] and part of [[Aragorn]]'s company that helped protect the Hobbits in the Shire and Bree-land during the dawn of the [[War of the Ring]]. He managed to free [[Mundo Sackville-Baggins]] from the [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] and a [[Nazg没l|Black Rider]]. Yet, the [[Nazg没l]] stabbed him with his dagger before riding off. Gravely poisoned, he seeks refuged in [[Archet]].<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref> 

Perhaps due to the poisoned blade, he joins the forces of Angmar. The [[Nazg没l]] that stabbed him along with four others attempts to change him into a [[wraiths|wraith]]. [[Aragorn]], [[Lenglinn]] and [[Torthann]] are able to drive off the Nazg没l. Amdir is slain by the [[Free peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]] before the change is completed.<ref>{{VGC|SAI}} Chapter 1: Unravelling the Thread</ref>
