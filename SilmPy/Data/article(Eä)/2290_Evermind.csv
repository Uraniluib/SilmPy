'''Evermind''' was a translation of the name [[simbelmynÃ«]], the name in [[Rohan]] for the small white flower that grew especially on the graves of [[Men]]. This association with the dead was the source of the flower's name - 'everlasting memory'.
==Etymology==
Tolkien noted that the element ''-mind'' has the sense "memory". Although the name resembles "[[wikipedia:Forget-me-not|forget-me-not]]" it's not the same kind of flower.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 780</ref>
