'''Telimektar''', son of [[Tulkas]], is one of the so called "Lost Valar", a character that appeared only in the early versions of the [[legendarium]]. Later on, he only survived as a constellation, but eventually lost his original name which, however, reappeared as a name of [[Telumehtar Umbardacil]], 28th [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]].

== Evolution ==
Telimektar is first mentioned in an early story, ''The Chaining of Melko''. Telimektar was "but just war-high" when he fought at his father's side against [[Melko]] in the war which ended with the captivity of the Enemy. Telimektar had "a long sword girt about his waist by a silver girdle."<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>

Later on, in the tale ''The Theft of Melko'', in the darkness after the darkening of the [[Trees]] Telimektar is pursuing [[Melko]] with other [[Gods]] (as they were then called) and "his face and weapons gleam as silver in the dark".<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 154</ref>

In ''The Tale of the Sun and Moon'' Telimektar is already conversed into a constellation, casually mentioned in a representation of the Heavens by [[Manwë]], who tells that the star [[Nielluin]] (Sirius, called [[Helluin]] in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'') is "nigh the foot of Telimektar son of Tulkas whose tale is yet to tell."<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 182; cf. p. 200</ref>

Alas, the tale was never properly told. Telimektar's last appearance in Tolkien's mythology is in ''The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales'',<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 278-334</ref> or more properly, in the sketches for this story collected (and edited) by [[Christopher Tolkien]] from his father's notebooks.

In the conclusion of the whole story that was to become ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', later totally rejected, Melko breaks away after the breaking of [[Angamandi]] (later: [[Angband]]) and goes to [[Tol Eressëa]] in order to create dissension among the Elves. The Gods do not interfere, but Tulkas decides to privily send Telimektar to aid the Elves.

Telimektar, with his silver sword, and [[Ingil]] (son of [[Ingwë#Other versions of the legendarium|Inwë]], king of the Eldar in [[Kôr]] or [[Valinor]]) surprise and wound Melko and then pursue him until Melko climbs to the great [[Pine of Tavrobel]]. There he must stay and Telimektar and Ingil (or [[Gil]], now the star Sirius) remain in the sky in guard against Melko's return.<ref name=LTII6>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 281</ref>

The last statement about Telimektar concerns with Telimektar's shape in the Heavens: the constellation should only be "the image of Telimektar in the sky?"  and the stars are given to him by [[Varda]] so that the Gods would know that he still is watching Melko. Also "he has diamonds on his sword-sheath, and this will go red when he draws his sword at the [[Great End]]".<ref name=LTII6/>

Then the end of the story was entirely changed and the character of Telimektar was also dropped. But as an echo of Telimektar, in the two following versions of the Silmarillion, the army of the [[Valar]] marches to the [[War of Wrath]],<ref>{{SM|2}}, pp. 11-75</ref> commanded by [[Fionwë]], son of [[Tulcas]].<ref>{{SM|2}}, p. 37</ref><ref>{{SM|Q17}}, p. 149</ref> Later on, Fionwë was called son of Manwë, and finally he was transformed to [[Eönwë]], Manwë's herald (as in ''The Silmarillion''<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>). Of Telimektar remained only the mention of [[Telumehtar]] as a name of Orion in the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'']].<ref>{{App|E1i}} (entry concerning the pronunciation of "H" in the Elvish languages)</ref>

== Names and Etymology ==
Telimektar also appears as an entry in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', an early representation of the Elvish language. The entry is titled ''Telimektar'', ''Telimbektar'' and the [[Gnomish]] form is told to be ''Telumaithar''. In the Valar name-list Telimektar is also called ''Taimondo'' or ''Taimordo'', in Gnomish ''Daimord''.<ref name="P268"/>

The first element ''Teli''- refers to the sky. Cf. ''telluma'' 'dome (of Varda)',<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref> ''telimbo'' 'sky', from the root TELE- 'cover in',<ref name=P268>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 268</ref> see also: TEL-, TELU-.<ref name=Ety>{{LR|P3}}</ref> The second element –'mektar'  "probably derives from the root MAKA".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 258, 268</ref><ref name=Ety/> The end of the name is thus related to the name of another "lost vala", [[Makar]] 'warrior' and is also seen in the other name of the constellation Orion, [[Menelmacar]].

The other name of Telimektar, Taimondo/Taimordo, is derived from the word ''taimë, taimië'' 'sky', but the end does not refer to warrior, being a loan from [[Gnomish]] word ''mord'' which means 'shepherd'. Thus the name of the constellation was also conceived as 'Shepherd of the Sky' ([[Taimavar]] in Qenya).<ref name=P268/>

For the sake of completeness note also the spelling ''Telumaith'' (see below), and ''Taimonto''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 281, 302</ref>

== On Telimektar and his son Lúthien ==
In a comment to ''The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales'',<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 302</ref> Christopher Tolkien treats the origin of the name of [[Lúthien]], which originally was the name given to the mariner [[Ælfwine|Ælfwine of England]] by the elves. C. Tolkien refers to a note coeval to the sketches of the story of [[Eriol]] and Ælfwine. In that note "Lúthien or [[Lúsion]] was son of Telumaith (Telumektar)". Ælfwine got his name because he "loved the sign of Orion, and made the sign". The name Lúthien is here explained to mean 'wanderer'. This storyline is not further developed or even mentioned neither does this interpretation of the name Lúthien appear elsewhere.
