The '''Silvan Elves''' ([[Sindarin|S]] '''''Tawarwaith'''''), or the '''Wood-elves''', was a name used to refer to the reclusive, forest-dwelling [[Elves]] of [[Middle-earth]]. In the late [[Third Age]], the Silvan Elves mostly belonged either to the [[Galadhrim]] or to the [[Elves of Mirkwood]].<ref name="SE-UTa"/>

==History==

The Silvan Elves were descendants of the [[Nandor]] (and thus in origin [[Teleri]]), who had lingered in the [[Vales of Anduin|Anduin Vales]] during the [[Great Journey]] of the [[Eldar]] in the [[Elder Days]]. The Silvan Elves hid themselves in their woodland realms beyond the [[Misty Mountains]] and became a scattered folk hardly distinguishable from [[Avari]].<ref name="SE-UTa">{{UT|6a}}</ref> While some of the Nandor continued to [[Eriador]] and later entered [[Ossiriand]], some remained in the Vales of Anduin, and from these latter originated the Wood-elves.<ref name="SE-UTa"/>

In the early [[Second Age]], after the [[War of Wrath]], [[Oropher]] of [[Doriath]] (father of [[Thranduil]] and grandfather of [[Legolas]]) along with few of the [[Sindar]] came to forest realm east of [[Misty Mountains]]. He became the King of the Silvan Elves and established the Wooldland Realm of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] ([[Sindarin|S]] '''Eryn Galen'''). The culture of Silvan folk were rude and rustic compared to the [[Beleriand|Beleriandic]] culture of the Sindar.<ref name="SE-UTb">{{UT|6b}}</ref> But soon the Sindar merged with the Silvan Elves and adopted their language, took names of Silvan form and style. This language was a dialect of Sindarin known as [[Silvan Elvish]].<ref name="SE-UTb"/> On the eastern side of the Misty Mountains, [[Amdír]] (father of [[Amroth]]), another Sinda leader came to the land known as [[Laurelindórenan]] (or Lórinand) and ruled over the Silvan elves as their King. 

It is also told that the some of the western [[Avari]], dwelling in Eriador and the Anduin Vales, were friendly to the [[Eldar]], and came to merge with the Wood-elves. These were [[Nelyar|Nelyarin]] Avari ([[Penni]]), from the third Clan (and therefore remotely akin to the Nandor and Sindar).<ref>{{WJ|C}}, pp. 381, 410</ref><ref group=note>It is not known if this merge occurred during the Elder Days, or during the Second or Third Ages.</ref>

In the early [[Third Age]] remnants of the Noldorin realms such as [[Lindon]] and [[Eregion]] sought new dwellings in more eastern lands and the Silvan Elves of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] experienced an influx of [[Noldor]] (and Sindar) who had survived the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the [[Sack of Eregion|fall of Eregion]].<ref name="SE-UTa"/>

==Etymology==

The English adjective ''[[Wiktionary:silvan|silvan]]'' means "of, characteristic of, or consisting of woods or forests" or "living or located in woods or forests".<ref>"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silvan silvan]" at [http://dictionary.reference.com Dictionary.reference.com] (Collins English Dictionary; accessed 17 July 2011)</ref>

==Names==

An [[Elvish]] name for the Silvan Elves was '''''Tawarwaith'''''. It has been suggested that ''Tawarwaith'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''tawar'' (wood, forest) + ''[[gwaith]]'' (people).<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 17 July 2011)</ref><ref>[[Didier Willis]], [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] at [http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com] (accessed 17 July 2011)</ref>
