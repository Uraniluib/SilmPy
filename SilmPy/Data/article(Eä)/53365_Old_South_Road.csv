{{disambig-two|the extension of the [[Greenway]]|the road of [[Beleriand]]|[[Old South Road (Beleriand)]]}}
The '''Old South Road''', was the name of the extension of the North Road (later Greenway) beyond [[Tharbad]] and into [[Enedwaith]].<ref name=gen>[[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref> 

It formed the great '''[[North-South Road]]''' that once led to [[Gondor]].<ref name=utmap>{{UT|Map}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref> However several disasters that struck [[Eriador]] during the [[Third Age]], including the dissolution of [[Arnor]] and the abandonment of Tharbad, made traffic between the former [[Two Realms]] scarce; the route was all but lost by the end of the [[Ages|Age]].<ref name=gen/>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name "Old South Road" appears only in the original [[General Map of Middle-earth]], as an extension of the Greenway to the south beyond Tharbad. After Tharbad, its line is dotted and disappears, suggesting (along with the name "Old") that it was perhaps ruined by the later [[Third Age]] and didn't go beyond Enedwaith. The road and the name also appears on [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''.

While editing the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] drew ''[[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]]''. In that map he "restores" by extrapolating the whole course of the Great Road, joining the interrupted lines.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref> The label "Old South Road" disappears however, and is replaced by the more general label "North-South Road", which refers to the whole restored route.<ref name=utmap/>
