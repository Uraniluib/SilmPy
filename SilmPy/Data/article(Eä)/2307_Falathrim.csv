The '''Falathrim''' were the shoreland Elves of the western shores of the [[Middle-earth]] who took [[Círdan]] as their lord from the beginning. They dwelt mainly in the ancient havens of [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]] of the [[Falas]], and their last home on Middle-earth before finally leaving for the Undying Lands was the [[Grey Havens]]. 

==History==
The [[Teleri]] were the most numerous Elven clan and for this reason they were led by two brothers, [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]] in the [[Great Journey]] to [[Aman]]. They were also the most slow and reluctant and many turned back or stayed behind. When Elwë became lost in [[Beleriand]], many of his people refused to carry on until he had been found; those were named [[Eglath]], the forsaken.

It was Olwë who led the rest to the shores of Beleriand. As they they lingered at the [[Bay of Balar]] where they were befriended and taught by [[Ulmo]]'s vassal, the [[Maia]] [[Osse]]. When Ulmo returned with the [[Tol Eressea|floating island]] to take the bulk of the Teleri to the West, Ossĕ convinced some of them to forsake Valinor and the other Elves and stay behind with him.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> 

These became the Falathrim, and their leader was [[Nowë]]<ref name="LastWritingsN">{{PM|Last}}, "Círdan", note 30</ref>, kin of both Elwë and Olwë, who stayed behind despite his great eagerness to see the [[light of Valinor]].<ref name="LastWritings">{{PM|Last}}, "Círdan"</ref> He was later known as Círdan. The Falathrim settled on Beleriand's western shores, building themselves Havens at [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] and became the first builders and sailors of ships in [[Middle-earth]]'s history. 

When Elwë returned, he established the Kingdom of [[Doriath]], claiming overlordship of all Beleriand as King Elu Thingol. The Falathrim, along with the Eglath, were considered [[Sindar]], and found many pearls that they sent to him as gifts.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> 

After the [[Return of the Noldor]], the Elves of the Falas became fast in friendship with the [[Noldor|Deep Elves]]. Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> With [[Finrod]]'s aid, the Havens of the Falas were strengthened and rebuilt. The Elves of the Havens enjoyed peaceful relations with all the [[Elves of Beleriand]], and were particularly closely allied with the people of [[Nargothrond]]. As one of the most remote peoples from [[Morgoth]]'s forces in [[Angband]], the other Elvish lords would often send their children to the Elves of the Havens for safekeeping.

They fought beside the [[Noldor]], too: in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame"), their mariners rescued High King [[Fingon]] from overwhelming hordes in [[Hithlum]], and they went to the aid of Fingon again at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"). After that disaster, many of the survivors fled back to the Havens of the Falas, but they were not safe there for long. A year after the great defeat, Morgoth sent his creatures to besiege them, and both the Havens were overthrown. Most of the Elves of the Falas perished in the fall of the Havens, or were captured, but Círdan escaped. With his surviving followers and the young [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], who was at that time lodging with the people of the Havens, he sailed southwards, and settled for a time on the [[Isle of Balar]]. He maintained a haven there for many years, before removing once again to Lindon, where he dwelt at the [[Grey Havens]] with, doubtless, a remnant of the Falathrim. 

As [[Morgoth]]'s power overwhelmed the Eldar, some "seafaring Sindar from the west havens" fled with 3 small ships to the east. They ended up to the confluence of [[Morthond]] and [[Ringló]]. There they established [[Edhellond]] and were eventually joined by their Telerin kin, [[Silvan Elves]] from the north.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref><ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[Second Age]], Círdan sailed east to found the [[Grey Havens]] on the [[Gulf of Lhûn]], and the remnant of the Elves of the Havens must surely have accompanied him.

==Etymology==
''Falathrim'' is a [[Sindarin]] name containing the word ''[[Falas]]''. It means "Coast people".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Falathrim"</ref>

In one text, the names '''[[Falmari]]''' (Quenya) and '''Falathrim''' (Sindarin) both refer to the people of [[Círdan]] in [[Beleriand]]<ref name=cirdan>{{PM|XIII}}</ref> however elsewhere and in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', the Quenya name refers to those in Valinor,<ref name=p3i3>{{MR|P3I3}}</ref><ref name=index>{{S|Index}}</ref> and the Sindarin name to those of the [[Falas]].<ref name=index/>

==Names==
The people of Círdan retained their name as Teleri and were known in [[Sindarin]] as '''Telir''' or '''Telerrim'''.<ref name=cirdan/>

Another name for the Falathrim was the '''Egladhrim''', or the '''Eglain''', a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "The Forsaken". While originally used as a name for the [[Sindar]] by themselves, it came to refer only to the Elves of the Falas, as distinguished from the "inland Elves" of Beleriand.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 365, 379-80</ref>
