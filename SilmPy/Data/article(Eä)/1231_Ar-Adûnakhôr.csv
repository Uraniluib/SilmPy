}}'''Ar-Adûnakhôr''' was the son of King [[Tar-Ardamin]] and the twentieth [[King of Númenor]].
==History==
Adûnakhôr was born in a time when most [[Númenóreans]] already had stopped using the [[Elvish|Elven tongues]] generations before, although it was still customary for the [[Kings of Númenor]] to take their royal names in [[Quenya]]. When Ar-Adûnakhôr succeeded his father, however, he was the first King to break with tradition and took his title in [[Adûnaic]].<Ref name=app>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

His name also was blasphemous, since its very meaning signifed "Lord of the West" and properly referred to the [[Valar]], or [[Manwë]] himself. It was deemed as a direct challenge to the lordship of the [[Valar]], and the [[Faithful]] Númenóreans (still loyal to the Valar) considered it ill-omened.<Ref name=app/> 

In addition to taking an Adûnaic name, Ar-Adûnakhôr forbade the speaking of the Elven tongues in his presence and persecuted the Faithful. Because of the cold feelings of Ar-Adûnakhôr and [[King's Men|most of his people]] to the [[Eldar]] and the [[Valar]], Elven ships came from [[Tol Eressëa]] to the west of Númenor only seldom and in secret.<Ref name=app/>

He was succeeded to the throne by his son, [[Ar-Zimrathôn]].<Ref name=app/>

== Etymology and names ==
Despite Ar-Adûnakhôr's hatred of the Elvish tongues his name was still recorded in the Scroll of Kings in High-elven form: Tar-Herunúmen.<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Ar-Adûnakhôr</ref>

''Adûnakhôr'' is an [[Adûnaic]] name that means "Lord of the West".  It can be analyzed as ''[[adûn]]'' "West" ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''dûn'') and ''khôr'' "Lord" ([[Quenya|Q.]] ''heru''). It is said that as a title, it signifies [[Manwe]]. Although the name was taken in defiance of [[Quenya]], ironically its elements are said to be of [[Elvish]] origin.<ref>{{webcite||author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/adunaic.htm|articlename=Adûnaic - the vernacular of Númenor}}</ref>
