The '''Fall of Minas Ithil''' was a battle that occurred in {{SA|3429}} between the forces of [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] in {{SA|3319|n}}, the sons of [[Elendil]] brought their ships up the [[Anduin]] and together founded the realm of [[Gondor]].  While [[Anárion]] set up his house in [[Minas Anor]], his brother [[Isildur]] established his house in [[Minas Ithil]] in a pass in the [[Ephel Dúath]] on the border of [[Mordor]].

But [[Sauron]] also escaped the Downfall and returned to Mordor.  There he built up his strength until he could assault the exiled [[Númenóreans]].  In {{SA|3429|n}} a great force took Minas Ithil, drove out Isildur, and burnt the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]].  Isildur escaped with his wife, his sons, and a seedling of the Tree.  They traveled to Elendil in the north while Anárion defended [[Osgiliath]] and kept Sauron at bay.

Sauron's attack and conquest of Minas Ithil was the spark that touched off the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>
