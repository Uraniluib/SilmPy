'''Valacirca''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] "''[[Sickle of the Valar]]''") was one of the [[constellations]] set in the heavens by [[Varda]] to enlighten the awakening of the Elves and gathered by Varda from among the ancient stars. It was [[Seven Stars|seven stars]] set in the north as a challenge to [[Melkor]].<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> when [[Bilbo Baggins]] came to the [[Long Lake]] (on the [[Nandor|Wood-elves]]' raft) he noticed the Valacirca twinkling in the north above the entry of the [[River Running]] into the lake.<ref name="Welcome">{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

On [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]] looked out of the window in the hobbits' room in [[Bree]] and saw the Valacirca bright above the shoulder of [[Bree-hill]].<ref name="Strider">{{FR|I10}}</ref>

==Other names==
In [[Sindarin]], the name was translated as '''[[Cerch]] [[i]]-[[balan|Mbelain]]'''. The names ''[[Otselen]]'' and ''[[Edegil]]'' were also used in reference to the seven stars of the constellation. [[Hobbits]] called it the ''Burning Briar'' (it was also referred to as the ''Wain'' in ''[[The Hobbit]]''<ref name="Welcome"/> and the ''Sickle'' in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''<ref name="Strider"/>). The constellation is also known as ''the Plough'', a name used in British English to refer to the seven brightest stars in ''Ursa Major'',<ref>{{WP|Ursa Major}}</ref> known in American English as ''Big Dipper''.  It is unclear whether the Dwarvish constellation ''[[Durin's Crown]]'', seen in the reflection of [[Mirrormere]],<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref> is the ''Valacirca''.

==Inspiration==
Valacirca is identified as the constellation of the [[wikipedia:Ursa Major|Great Bear]].<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Valacirca is by far the most important constellation in the heavens of Arda. It is also the first to appear in the mythology that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] began to develop in the [[1910]]s.<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, passim.</ref>

In the earliest map that Tolkien made for ''The Hobbit'' (referred to as Fimbulfambi's map by [[John D. Rateliff]] in ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') the compass rose used a tiny diagram of the Valacirca to indicate "North".<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 21</ref>
