{{quote|Arrow!" said the bowman. "Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true king under the Mountain, go now and speed well!|[[Bard]], [[Fire and Water]]}} 
According to [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], the [[Black Arrow]] had originated in the Lonely Mountain and had been passed down to him from his father and grandfather of the line of [[Girion]]. It was magical for him and whenever he shot it, he always recovered it.

When in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] attacked [[Lake-town]], after being disturbed by [[Thorin and Company]] in the [[Lonely Mountain]], the '''Black Arrow''' was the last arrow left in Bard's quiver.

Bard fired the arrow through a bare patch in the armour on Smaug's underbelly, described to him by the [[Thrushes|Thrush]]. The arrow penetrated Smaug's heart, killing the dragon immediately.<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] may have found inspiration for the weapon that achieves its goal and then perishes in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''.  In that story Beowulf's sword cannot kill Grendal's mother but another sword, an ancient blade found in her lair, can destroy her and slice off Grendel's head.  However, the sword then melted down to the hilt.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, (ii) ''The Black Arrow'', p. 558</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Black Arrows are said to have been a gift to each [[Lord of Dale]] from King [[Thrór]] in gratitude for saving the first dwarf king's life. The eighth Lord of Dale, later known as [[Girion]], wasted all the arrows while attempting to kill Smaug, except for the one which his son "Brandjarn" rescued and was passed down to Bard.

:After the restoration of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]], [[Dáin Ironfoot]] gifted the [[King of Dale|Kings of Dale]] with newly-forged Black Arrows. Shortly after the [[Battle of Dale]], young King [[Bard II]] wounded the great [[Cold-drake]] "Vethúg Wintermind" with a Black Arrow, thwarting the drake's attack on Erebor.
