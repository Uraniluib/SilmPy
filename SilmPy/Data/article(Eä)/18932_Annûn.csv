__NOTOC__
'''''annûn''''' is the [[Sindarin]] word for "sunset", and thus used as "West".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''andúnë''</ref>

==Etymology==
''Annûn'' has a peculiar spelling because it is spelled with a circumflex (ˆ), which Tolkien used in monosyllables of Sindarin. An explanation is that ''annûn'' was only a variant of ''[[dûn]]''.

The evolution was parallel of that of ''dûn'', only that it came from [[OS]] *''andûne''. The [[PQ]] ''[[ndûnê]]'' ([[root]] [[NDÛ]]) evolved a "syllabic nasal" *''ṇdûnê'' which further evolved in the full vowel *''a-''<ref>[[David Salo]]'s [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/35968 message] at [[Elfling]] mailing list</ref>.
