* Death of [[Elphir]], [[Princes of Dol Amroth|Prince]] of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name="Dol">{{PM|Elendil}}, The Line of Dol Amroth, p. 223</ref><ref group="note">In the list of the Princes of Dol Amroth in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' the death of Elphir was first shown as "(3087=) F.A. 57".  This is incorrect since 3087 should correspond to F.A. '''67'''. Later on the same page 3087 is equated with F.A. 67 so the date of 57 was a typo.</ref>
