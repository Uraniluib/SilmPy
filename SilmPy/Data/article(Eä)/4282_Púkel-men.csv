'''Púkel-men''' were the ancient carved images, that lined the road to [[Dunharrow]], the [[Stair of the Hold]], in the [[White Mountains]]. One statue was standing in each turn of the winding road; each resembled a man with clumsy limbs, squatting cross-legged with his short arms folded across his fat belly.  

These were carved by the ancient, long-forgotten men of the [[Second Age]], perhaps related to the [[Oathbreakers]], who populated the [[White Mountains]]. The statues were thought to be in the likeness of Woses or [[Drúedain]], who also had made their homes there.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> All had eroded over the years until some had no features except empty eye holes.  The [[Rohirrim]] ignored the statues when they passed them.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''púcel'' in [[Old English]] means "little goblin".<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, note 14</ref> The element ''púc'' "goblin" is related to the name [[Wikipedia:Puck|Puck]] and the modern English word "pug".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 219</ref>
