'''Erendis''' was the wife of [[Tar-Aldarion]], the sixth [[King of Númenor]]. She came from a family of lower status than Tar-Aldarion, so she had a lesser life-span than he. Erendis loved the land of [[Númenor]], especially her own region of [[Emerië]].

'''Lady of the Star-brow''' was a name the people of [[Númenor]] gave to [[Erendis]].

==History==
In the Spring of {{SA|858}},<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, NOTES, ''Chronology''</ref> Prince [[Aldarion]] and [[Erendis]] were betrothed. Years before this event Aldarion had given her a diamond in gratitude for her bringing to his ship a bough of ''[[oiolairë]]'' and Erendis wore the jewel about her neck. When their betrothal was announced, Aldarion offered his wife-to-be other jewels but she declared that she only wanted the one jewel. She then set it in a silver fillet and had Aldarion bind it about her forehead. Thus she became known throughout the land as [[Tar-Elestirnë]], which means "Lady of the Star-brow".<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

After courting for years, she and Aldarion married. Though Erendis resented it, Aldarion insisted on continuing with his voyages to [[Middle-earth]], causing a rift between the two. Erendis took their daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]] with her and went to live on her own on her farm. When Aldarion returned, he demanded to have his daughter returned to him, which Erendis did grudgingly, but her pride kept her from returning to him.

The partial story of Aldarion and Erendis can be found in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. Though the story was left incomplete, the book does give some hints on how it concluded. In her old age, Erendis dwelt in Emerië. When she heard that Tar-Aldarion was returning from his last voyage, she journeyed incognito to the haven of [[Rómenna]]; there it is said she "perished in the water".<ref name="Wife"/>

After Erendis, the wearing of a white jewel upon the brow became a tradition among the kings and queens of Númenor to mark their royalty. Later, in [[Middle-earth]], this tradition continued in [[Arnor]] with the wearing of the [[Elendilmir]], a star-like gem upon the brow.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 32</ref>
