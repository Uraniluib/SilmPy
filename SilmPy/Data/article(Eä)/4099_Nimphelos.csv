'''Nimphelos''' was a huge pearl said to have been the size of a dove's egg (that is, an inch or more in diameter) that was found along the shores of the [[Isle of Balar]] by the [[Falathrim]]. [[Círdan]] gave it, along with many lesser pearls, to his friend and ally [[Thingol]]. When Thingol called on the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] to aid in the building of [[Menegroth]], Nimphelos was among the rewards he gave them, and the [[Lord of Belegost]] was said to have prized the pearl over a mountain of wealth.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref><ref>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 11, 108 (§22) </ref>
