==Etymology==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] has suggested that ''I Vene Kemen'' is a [[Qenya]] name perhaps meaning "The Shape of the Earth" or "The Vessel of the Earth".<ref name=LT1/> The element ''vene'' is likely related to the root VENE "shape, cut out, scoop" and its derivative ''venë'' ("small boat, vessel, dish"). For the element ''kemen'', the Qenya Lexicon contains the words ''kemi'' ("earth, soil") and ''kemen'' ("soil"), derived from the root KEME.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 254, 257 (entries ''Glorvent'' amd ''Kémi'')</ref>
