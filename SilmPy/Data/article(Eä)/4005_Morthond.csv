The '''Morthond''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] "Black root") was one of the seven rivers of [[Gondor]]. It arose in the [[White Mountains]] in a narrow valley that led to the southern entrance of the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref name="Passing">{{RK|V2}}</ref> The river flowed south-west for half its length and then turned south-east before joining the [[Ringló]]<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> near [[Cobas Haven]].<ref name="West">{{WR|3|XIV}}, West, p. 434</ref>

==History==
Near the confluence of the Morthond and the Ringló was the ancient Elf-haven of [[Edhellond]]. This refuge had been founded at the beginning of the [[Second Age]] by a remnant of [[Elves]] from [[Doriath]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ''Amroth and Nimrodel''</ref>

At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] the lord of the [[Blackroot Vale]] was [[Duinhir]]. He and his two sons, [[Duilin (son of Duinhir)|Duilin]] and [[Derufin]], marched to [[Minas Tirith]] with five hundred bowmen to aid in the city's defence.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> On [[8 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], the [[Grey Company]], and the [[Oathbreakers|Army of the Dead]] exited from the Paths of the Dead alongside the Morthond.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> They followed the young river before crossing a bridge on their way to the [[Stone of Erech]].<ref name="Passing"/>

==Etymology==
''Morthond'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "black-root".<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Morthond''</ref> The first element ''mor'' means "dark" or "black".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''mor''</ref> The second element ''thond'' means "root".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 96</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The course and placement of the Morthond changed greatly during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In the First Map of [[Middle-earth]] the Morthond was separate from and far west of the Ringló (with [[Dol Amroth]] far to the west of the Morthond).<ref>{{TI|MIII}}</ref> When [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] developed Outline VI for Book V in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' he drew a map with the Morthond east of the Ringló and the Morthond joined the [[Anduin]] near its mouth.<ref>{{WR|3|II}}</ref> When Tolkien made the detailed Second Map there were four rivers – [[Calenhir]], Morthond, Kiril, and Ringló – that flowed independently until they all combined just before exiting into Cobas Haven.<ref name="West"/>
