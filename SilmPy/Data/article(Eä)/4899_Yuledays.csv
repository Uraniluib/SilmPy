The '''Yuledays''' or '''Yule-tide''' were the midwinter festival days that marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. They were celebrated in [[the Shire]]<ref name="D2" />, but also by the [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]] and [[Gondor]]; the word "Yule" was recognisable in Gondor as a 'northern name' for the midwinter festival.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 781</ref>

After the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], [[Beorn]] summoned many Northmern to [[Beorn's Hall|his home]] to feast. [[Bilbo]] and [[Gandalf]] were also there, on their way to the Shire and passed the Yule-tide ({{TA|2941}}â€”{{TA|2942|n}}).<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

In the [[Shire Calendar]] there was a six-day Yuletide festival ([[29 December|29 Foreyule]] to [[2 January|2 Afteryule]]); at their center were the two [[Yule]]-days that fell outside the formal 'months' of the calendar, between [[Foreyule]] and [[Afteryule]].<ref name="D2">{{App|D2}}</ref>
