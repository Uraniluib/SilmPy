'''Money''', specifically minted coin money, was used in the [[Westlands]] as early as the [[Third Age]].
  
==History==
In [[Gondor]], the chief currency was the [[Castar]]; a small silver coin known as the [[Tharni]] was worth one-fourth of a Castar.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 45</ref>

[[Azog]] threw a money purse at [[NÃ¡r]] containing "few coins of little worth" (which the Dwarves later stuffed in the mouth of Azog's decapitated head after his defeat).<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

When [[Bilbo Baggins]] rushed from his door to meet [[Thorin]] and his party of dwarves at the [[Green Dragon|Green Dragon Inn]], he found himself outside without "a hat, a walking stick, or any ''money'', or anything that he usually took with him when he went out".<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

After the death of [[Smaug]] and the destruction of [[Esgaroth]] the people were angry at the [[Master of Lake-town]] and declared, "We have had enough of the old men and the ''money-counters''!"  Others took up the cry of "Up with the Bowman (meaning [[Bard]]) and down with ''Moneybags''".<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>

Much of the gold and silver wealth of Dwarf-horde of Smaug appears to have been minted.  [[Bilbo Baggins]] took home two chests from the horde, one containing gold and the other silver,<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref> and as a result (in addition to his family's pre-existing wealth) lived very comfortably for the next 50 years and was considered quite rich.  In addition to the [[Hobbits of Bree]], the [[Hobbits of the Shire]] apparently dealt in coin money as well, otherwise they might not have been so eager to search [[Bag End]] after Bilbo left, looking for secret treasure rooms.

Money was mentioned in relation to the trading town of [[Bree]].  At the end of the [[Third Age]], a pony was considered to be worth about four [[silver pennies]].  The well-to-do owner of the [[Prancing Pony]], [[Barliman Butterbur]], considered a loss of 30 silver pennies to be a considerable blow.<ref name="Knife">{{FR|I11}}</ref>  A gold piece was regarded as a particularly extravagant reward for good news.

Additionally, Bilbo is mentioned to have spent his last fifty ducats on the party in the first version of "A Long-expected Party".<ref name="HoME">{{RS|1Ii}}</ref>

When [[Aragorn]] and the four hobbits were camped on the side of [[Weathertop]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] wandered to the edge of the dell.  Soon he came running back in fear and said, "I durstn't go outside this dell for any ''money''."<ref name="Knife"/>

==Background Information==
In ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' by [[Robert Foster]], the entry for "Money" on page 344 makes it a point to say 

{{quote|'''contrary to the claims of some''', there are references to money in ''The Lord of the Rings''|The Complete Guide to Middle-earth'' - "Money"}}  

The above phrase suggests that (in the early days of [[Tolkien fandom]]) there was some belief that coin money used as actual "currency" did not exist in Middle-earth; references to money are scarce, not highlighted and obviously forgettable among the narrative.
