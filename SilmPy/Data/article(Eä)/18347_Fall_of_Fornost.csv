The '''Fall of Fornost''' was an event that resulted from the defeat of the forces of [[Arnor]], and the taking of their capital city of [[Fornost Erain]] by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and his armies.

== History ==
=== Prelude ===

By the year {{TA|1974}} things were looking very grim for the Dúnedain of Arnor.  The [[Great Plague]] three hundred years previously had killed most of the people of [[Cardolan]] which later fell to the Witch-king.  And even with the aid of [[Elves]] and [[Hobbits]] most of the now diminished and totally demoralized people of Arnor were now waiting to make their final stand at Fornost, capital city of [[Arthedain]]. 

=== Opposing Forces ===

For the forces of [[Eriador]] exact numbers are not known, but it can be estimated that at the most ten thousand [[Men of Arnor]] were present at the city.  Along with likely several thousand Elves of [[Lindon]], [[Rivendell]], [[Lothlórien]], and five hundred Hobbits archers from [[the Shire]].

For the forces of [[Angmar]] it can be estimated that there was at least forty thousand or at the most sixty thousand [[Orcs]], Trolls, Evil Men, Wolves, and all other manner of evil creatures.

=== The Battle ===

Not much is known of the battle, and it is simply stated that the Witch-king overran Fornost and the King was driven into the North Downs. The Witch-king's forces occupied Fornost and pillaged it.

=== Aftermath ===

With Arthedain in his hands, the Witch-king had conquered all of Arnor. Arvedui perished in the [[Icebay of Forochel]] when a ship sent to rescue him sank in a storm. The Witch-king took the throne in the king's palace, until a year later in {{TA|1975}} when the forces of Eriador had regrouped with newly arrived reinforcements from [[Gondor]]. In the [[Battle of Fornost]] his army was destroyed, and he himself fled east over the [[Misty Mountains]].

Fornost was not resettled after the war.  It became a deserted place, feared by the men of [[Bree]], who called it Deadmen's Dike.  Not until a thousand years later after the [[War of the Ring]] under King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was it refounded.
