'''Elvenhome''' almost always refers to [[Eldamar]] (which is "Elvenhome" in the Elves' own tongue), the homeland of the Elves in [[Aman]], which is its translation.<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> 

The word also was a general term for a land inhabited by [[Elves]]. For example, an "Elvenhome" in the song about [[Beren]] and [[Luthien]] refers to [[Doriath]],<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref> and an Elvenhome is mentioned in the [[Hobbit]]-poem ''[[The Hoard]]'',<ref>{{AB|14}}</ref> which, in that context, probably referred to [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}} p.116, entry "Elvenhome"</ref>
