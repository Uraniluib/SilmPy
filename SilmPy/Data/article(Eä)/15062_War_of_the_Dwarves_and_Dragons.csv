The '''War of the [[Dwarves]] and [[Dragons]]''' is a name given to the conflict that took place between [[Durin's Folk]] and the [[Dragons]] of the [[Grey Mountains]] that took place from {{TA|2570}} to around {{TA|2589|n}}. It brought about the death of King [[Dáin I]] and resulted in [[Durin's Folk]] returning to the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name="Durin"/>

==Background==
{{blockquote|The Dwarves hid themselves in deep places, guarding their hoards; but when evil began to stir again and dragons reappeared, one by one their ancient treasures were plundered, and they became a wandering people.|{{App|B2}}}}
Following the defeat of [[Morgoth]] in the [[War of Wrath]], many Dragons were left in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref> Between the [[Second Age|Second]] and the [[Third Age]] the [[Seven Rings]] helped the Dwarves increase their treasure troves which however drew the mightiest of dragons and opponents; and over the years they plundered the works of the Dwarves and devoured some of the Rings.<ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

Many centuries before the beginning of the War, the Dragon [[Scatha]] had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. Scatha was slain by [[Fram]] of the [[Éothéod]], who kept the treasure for himself and refused to yield a penny of it to the Dwarves.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

Following the loss of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] to [[Durin's Bane|the Balrog]], in {{TA|1999}} [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. However, in {{TA|2210|n}} Thráin's son, [[Thorin I]], abandoned Erebor and removed his people to the [[Grey Mountains]] to join the rest of [[Durin's Folk]].<ref name="AppB" />

==History==
{{blockquote|But there were dragons in the wastes beyond; and after many years they became strong again and multiplied, and they made war on the Dwarves, and plundered their works.|{{App|Durin}}}}
The dragons of the [[Forodwaith]] eventually multiplied and became strong, and in {{TA|2570}}<ref name="AppB">{{App|B2}}</ref> the Dragons made war on the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]], sacking and plundering their halls. The Dwarves held out for around twenty years, but finally in {{TA|2589|n}}<ref name="AppB"/> the Dragons attacked the halls of King [[Dáin I]]. King Dáin, and his second son [[Frór]], were killed by a [[Cold-drake]] outside his door to his [[Dáin's Halls|halls]].<ref name="Durin"/>

Following the death of their king, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the Grey Mountains. In {{TA|2590|n}},<ref name="AppB"/> King [[Thrór]] and his uncle [[Borin]] returned to the Erebor with the [[Arkenstone]] to re-establish the Kingdom under the Mountain. However, Thrór's younger brother [[Grór]] led others to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] and the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] managed to prosper for the following couple of centuries.<ref name="Durin"/> However the threat of Dragons would return: in {{TA|2770}} the dragon [[Smaug]], hearing of the wealth of Erebor, flew south from the North "like a hurricane" and [[Sack of Erebor|attacked]] the wealthy Dwarven [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref> Smaug dwelt in the Lonely Mountain until the [[Quest for Erebor]] in {{TA|2941|n}} which resulted in Smaug being killed by a [[Black Arrow]] shot by [[Bard]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref> Although [[Thorin]] was killed in the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]], [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]] of the [[Iron Hills]] (grandson of [[Grór]]) became [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] and [[King under the Mountain]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>
