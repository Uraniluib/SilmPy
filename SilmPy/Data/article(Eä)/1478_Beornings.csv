'''Beornings''' were a people of the upper [[Vales of Anduin]], between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=AppMen/><ref name=H18/><ref name =FRII1/>
==History==
As other [[Northmen]], the Beornings descended from Men of the [[First Age]] who were related to the [[Edain]],<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref> perhaps akin to the [[House of Hador|Third House]].<ref>{{UT|8}}</ref> As such, the Beornings were close kin of the [[Éothéod]], the [[Woodmen]] of [[Mirkwood]] and the [[Bardings]].<ref>{{App|A2}}</ref><ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and the decimation of the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], many Northmen gathered around [[Beorn]] who became a great chief. It is possible that the Beornings became known as a people through being descendants of Beorn.<ref name=H18>{{H|18}}</ref><ref name=FRII1>{{FR|II1}}</ref> 

The Beornings kept open the passages of the [[Ford of Carrock]] and the [[High Pass]] in return for tolls,<ref name=FRII1/> likely clearing the paths from [[Dale]] to [[Rivendell]] from evil creatures such as [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]].<ref>{{TI|XIII}}, pp. 263-4 (note 15)</ref>

In the events leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], the Beornings helped [[Aragorn]], who was taking [[Gollum]] to Mirkwood, to cross the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|10}}, "(ii) Other Versions of the Story"</ref> 

During the War, [[Grimbeorn]], son of Beorn, was the leader of the Beornings.<ref name=FRII1/> It is possible that [[Sauron]]'s forces had attacked them in early {{TA|3019}}: when [[Frodo Baggins]] wore  [[the One Ring]] upon [[Amon Hen]], he saw the land of the Beornings aflame.<ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>

After the War, the Beornings and the Woodmen were given central [[Eryn Lasgalen]] by [[Thranduil]] and [[Celeborn]].<ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
They spoke the [[Westron|Common Speech]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Leila Keene and Pat Kirke]]" (cf. ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', p. 72)</ref> and had perhaps also their own dialect of it or tongue.<ref name=AppMen>{{App|Men}}</ref><ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 34 (§14)</ref>

Through many generations, the descendants of Beorn were like him [[skin-changers]], able to take the shape of a [[bears|bear]].<ref group=note>Since it is unknown if all Beornings came from the line of Beorn, one can only guess if this was valid for all the Beornings.</ref> Some of Beorn's descendants were grim like him and even "bad", but none of them matched Beorn in size and strength.<ref name=H18/>

The Beornings seemed to have shared a dislike for [[Dwarves]],<ref name=FRII1/><ref>{{H|7}}: [Beorn speaking:] "''I am not over fond of dwarves''"</ref> perhaps related to the latters' praise of metals and the formers' disinterest in it.<ref>{{H|7}}: "''[The Dwarves] spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and few save the knives were made of metal at all.</ref>

They were known as great bakers, famous for their honey-cakes (which could feed travellers similarly to the ''[[lembas]]'') although they were reluctant to share them with travelers around the time of the War of the Ring.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

'''2011-: [[The One Ring (role-playing game)|''The One Ring'' (role-playing game)]]:'''

:Beornings are one of the playable cultures. The game describes them as rough Men, sometimes outlaws, gathered under the banner of Beorn. One of their cultural Virtues is the ability to take control of a 'spirit animal' whilst sleeping, a talent taught to some Beornings by Beorn himself.<ref>{{TOR|Adventures}}, pp. 41-6</ref>

'''2013: [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''
:Beorn tells [[Thorin and Company]] that in the past Azog hunted him and his people for sport and that, as a result, few of his kind are left. It is one of his prime motivations to help them in [[Quest of Erebor|their Quest]].
