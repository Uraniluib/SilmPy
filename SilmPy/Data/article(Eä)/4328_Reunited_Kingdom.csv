The '''Reunited Kingdom''' (also called the '''Two Kingdoms'''<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 6</ref>) was the restored kingdom of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], the twin kingdoms founded at the end of the [[Second Age]] by [[Elendil]] and his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]. In the beginning, Elendil was [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of both realms, but the two were divided after the deaths of his sons. Over 3,000 years later [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]] reunited the kingdoms and ruled as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the Reunited Kingdom.

The fate of the kingdoms, especially that of Gondor, would come to dominate the history of the [[Third Age]].
==Background==
At the end of the [[Second Age]], [[Elendil]] and his sons established two great kingdoms in [[Middle-earth]]: [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south. These Kingdoms of the [[Dúnedain]] were united under a single [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]], Elendil himself, who ruled the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] while his sons reigned jointly over the South-kingdom of [[Gondor]].

In the first years of the [[Third Age]], this union failed. After the loss of [[Isildur]] at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], his nephew [[Meneldil]] took up the kingship of Gondor, and that country remained independent from the North-kingdom through most of the Third Age. 
===Dissolutions===
In the north, the realm of Arnor fell into troubled times. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and in time these too were lost, so that the Dúnedain of the North-kingdom of Elendil were reduced to a wandering people led by a [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]]. Nonetheless, they were able to maintain Isildur's line in unbroken descent.

However this failed in Gondor, and [[Eärnur]] was lost without heirs. Its rule was taken up by the [[Stewards]]. 

There were two attempts to reunite the kingdoms. The first of these occurred in III 1944, when [[Arvedui]] of [[Arthedain]] claimed the High Kingship of the Two Kingdoms. His claim was rejected by Steward [[Pelendur]] and the [[Council of Gondor]], who elected to maintain their independence.

==Reunification==
More than a thousand years later, after the [[War of the Ring]], Arvedui's direct descendant [[Aragorn]] came forward to make the same claim. This time, the people of Gondor accepted a High King, and the Two Kingdoms were reunited at last. 

Aragorn ruled from Minas Tirith, but he travelled throughout his wide lands. He rebuilt Annuminas and when he went north would rule from there. [[The Shire]] was an exception to this, and though it lay within the [[Reunited Kingdom]], Aragorn made a law that Men should not enter it, a law that he observed himself. After Aragorn's death, his son [[Eldarion]] took up the High Kingship, and the Reunited Kingdom endured for many years under the new King and his descendants.
