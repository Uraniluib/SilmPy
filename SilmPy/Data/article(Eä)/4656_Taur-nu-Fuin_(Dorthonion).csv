'''Taur-nu-Fuin''' was a name for the northern parts of [[Dorthonion]], and sometimes for the forest as a whole after it was corrupted by [[Morgoth]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. The kingdoms of Dorthonion were destroyed at that point, including [[Ladros]] and the realm of [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]]. [[Barahir]] remained as an outlaw in Taur-nu-Fuin, and after his death [[Beren]] his son dwelt in this forest for several years, before crossing the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] and forsaking Dorthonion to its captors. Then it was truly wholly "under nightshade".<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

After [[Sauron]] was defeated by [[Huan]] in their battle upon [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] he took the form of a vampire and fled to Taur-nu-Fuin, filling the forest with horror.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

After [[Túrin]] was captured upon [[Amon Rûdh]] he was taken by the orcs through Taur-nu-Fuin northwards. In those woods the pursuing [[Beleg]] came upon [[Gwindor]], who told him of seeing Túrin being whipped and driven towards [[Angband]]. Together the two Elves followed the orcs out onto the barren dunes of [[Anfauglith]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In early texts it was spelled ''Taur-n''a''-Fuin'', as seen in the excerpt from the Lay above.

Another [[Noldorin]] name is given as ''Deldu(w)ath'' translated as "Deadly Nightshade".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry DYEL</ref> In [[Sindarin]], it comes from ''[[taur]]'' "great forest",''[[nu]]'' "under" and ''[[fuin]]'' "night, gloom" (translated "nightshade").{{fact}}
