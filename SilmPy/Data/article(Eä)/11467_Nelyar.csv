The '''Nelyar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron {{IPA|[ˈneʎar]}}) was the original name of the third Clan of the elves, [[Teleri]], before the [[Great March]]. The Clan-name, meaning 'Thirds' (q. cardinal <i>nelya</i> 'third') was derived from the name of the father of the Clan, [[Enel]] 'Three'. Enel was the third [[Elf-fathers|Elf-father]], who awoke at [[Cuiviénen]]. 

They were the largest clan, being the 74/144 of the population. Of those, the 46/74 followed [[Elwë]] to the West and became the [[Teleri]], while 28/74 [[Avari|stayed back]] with [[Morwë]] and/or [[Nurwë]].

The other original clans were [[Minyar]] 'Firsts', and [[Tatyar]] 'Seconds' according to the Elf-fathers [[Imin]] 'One' and [[Tata]] 'Two'.

Eventually some of the Avari of the Nelyar reached [[Beleriand]]. Unlike the Tatyar, those Avari were friendly to the Eldar, willing to learn from them and had a feeling of kinship. Later in [[Eriador]] and the [[Vales of Anduin]], Lindarin Avari often merged with the Eldar of Middle-earth.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 380-1</ref>
