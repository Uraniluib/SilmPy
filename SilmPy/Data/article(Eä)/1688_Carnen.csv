'''Carnen''' &mdash; [[Sindarin]] for '''Redwater''' &mdash; was a [[:Category:Rivers|river]] that flowed generally southward from the [[Iron Hills]] east of the [[Lonely Mountain]] until it met the [[River Running|Celduin]] about 250 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles to the south.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  Its course lay in the boundary region between "The North" (the northwestern region of [[Middle-earth]]) and the vast "East" (the area called [[Rhûn]]).<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

Between the time when [[Thráin I]] founded the dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain (in {{TA|1999|n}}) and the arrival of [[Smaug]] (in {{TA|2770|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>) the Northmen living between the Celduin and Carnen grew strong and repelled all eastern enemies.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>  This area became depopulated after the arrival of the dragon but again filled with Northmen after Smaug's demise.  During the [[War of the Ring]] the northern host of [[Sauron]] crossed the Carnen and drove the forces of King [[Brand]] back to [[Dale]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
