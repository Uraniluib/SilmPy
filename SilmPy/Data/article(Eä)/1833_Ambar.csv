'''''Ambar''''' also refers to "The World" with the connotation of "habitation" or "home" ("[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikumene Oikoumene]"<ref>{{HM|L}}, [[Letter 283]]</ref>), which referred to the inhabited world, as opposed to the barbaric wild. 

In this sense ''Ambar'' is different than ''[[Arda]]'', which refers to the world as a physical whole.
==Etymology==
[[Sundocarmë|Root]] A-[[MBAR]] "dwelling, habitation"<ref name="E" />
==Cognates==
*[[Sindarin]] ''[[amar]]'' "earth", ''[[bar]]'' "land"
==See also==
*[[már]], "home, dwelling"
* [[Ambar-metta]], "the Ending of the World"
==Notes==
The [[Elves]] may have equated the concept of "doom" with the inhabited world because their ''[[fëar]]'' were tied eternally with Arda, as opposed to [[Men]], whose souls escape beyond the world upon death (see: the [[Gift of Men]]). 

Furthermore, the roots MBAR and MBAR-AT might be ultimately related.
