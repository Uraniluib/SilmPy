'''Goldilocks Gardner''' (born {{SR|1431}}) was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Goldilocks was the third daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Rose Cotton]], so named because her fair hair was rare among the [[Shire-hobbits]], but not among Sam's children.<ref name="RC"/> In {{SR|1463}} she married [[Thain]] [[Faramir Took I|Faramir I]], son of [[Peregrin Took]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Although the name refers to her hair, it is also in accordance to the Hobbit custom of giving flower-names to women. Goldilocks sometimes refers to buttercup or daisy flowers.<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 613</ref> An abandoned [[Sindarin]] name for her was ''Glorfinniel''.<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref>
