'''Archet''' was the most remote of the settlements of the [[Bree-land]], set among the trees on the northern edge of the [[Chetwood]], somewhat to the east of [[Bree]] itself.<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> A few [[hobbits]] lived there, but the inhabitants were predominantly [[Big Folk]].

When the hobbits and [[Gandalf]] returned to Bree after their journey south, [[Barliman Butterbur]] told them of the fight within Bree in which some Bree-landers were killed.  After the fight the robbers took to hiding in the woods beyond Archet.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> 
==Etymology==

The name ''Archet'' is said to be an "English place-name of [[Celtic]] origin", sharing the element ''chet'' "wood" with ''[[Chetwood#Etymology|Chetwood]]''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 765</ref> [[Mark T. Hooker]] has suggested that the element ''[[Wiktionary:ar-#Old_Irish|Ar-]]'' is a prefix meaning "nearby", found in several [[Welsh]] place-names. The meaning of ''Archet'' would thus be "near the woods", which Hooker notes describes its geographic position "''on the edge of the Chetwood''".<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', p. 8</ref>

Its form suggests a natural evolution of a Celtic word borrowed in the [[Old English]] times as ''Arcet'', to the modern English.<ref name=etym/>

''Archet'' is equivalent to the real-life [[Welsh]] name ''[[Wikipedia:Argoed|Argoed]]'', with the same meaning "By the woods".<ref name=etym>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
== Portrayals in Adaptations ==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Archet is the settlement players start at if they are Hobbits or of the Race of Man. During the [[Bree-land Introduction|introduction]] of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar|Shadows of Angmar]]'' it comes under attack by [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] brigands who burn many of the homes to the ground. The settlement is commanded by Captain Brackenbrook, a retired sell-sword, but command passes on to his son, [[Jon Brackenbrook]], when his father is killed in the attack.
