'''Bard II''' was the son of [[Brand]] and heir to the [[Kingdom of Dale]]. His father was slain in the [[Battle of Dale]], and Bard was forced back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], where he was besieged with his ally [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]] for several days. When news came from the south of the destruction of [[Sauron]], Bard and Thorin emerged from the [[Lonely Mountain]] and broke the siege.  Later he sent an ambassador to the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and thereafter his kingdom enjoyed the protection of the King of the West.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
