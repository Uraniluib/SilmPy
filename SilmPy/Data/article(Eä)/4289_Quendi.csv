The '''Quendë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈkʷende]}}), plural '''[[Quendi]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈkʷendi]}}), was the name given by the [[Elves]] to their own kind while they still dwelt at [[Cuiviénen]].  ''Quendë'' means "speaker; who speak with voices", for upon arising they met no other living thing that spoke or sang.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>  However, [[Ilúvatar]] also called them ''Quendi'' before any of them awoke.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>

The plural form was much more popular as a word.

The word is a direct derivative of the [[Primitive Quendian]] word ''[[Kwende]]'' from [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[KWE]]NE.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''KWEN(ED)'''</ref>

''Quendë'' is an exceptional case where the PQ short final ''-e'' was retained in Quenya instead of disappearing.
