}} '''Tar-Telperiën''' was the tenth monarch of [[Númenor]] and its second [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Ruling Queen]]. She was the eldest child of [[Tar-Súrion]], and a proud and willful ruler.

Little is known of Tar-Telperiën's reign, but it is stated in ''[[Line of Elros (document)|The Line of Elros]]'' that she refused to wed, and so died without an heir. During her rule in Númenor, momentous events took place in [[Middle-earth]]: the [[Rings of Power]] were forged and the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began. Despite the ancient alliance between the [[Dúnedain]] and the [[Elves]], Tar-Telperiën did not interfere in these matters; her successor had to deal with Middle-earth's troubles.

Tar-Telperiën was long-lived even for one of [[Elros]]' line, and appeared to be reluctant to give up her power: unlike all the rulers of Númenor before her, she did not surrender the [[Sceptre]] to her successor a few years before her death, but instead waited until just prior to it.

Tar-Telperiën's nephew Minastir, the son of her younger brother [[Isilmo]], succeeded her and ruled as [[Tar-Minastir]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Telperiën</ref>

== Etymology ==
Tar-Telperiën's name is in [[Quenya]]. It is difficult to translate exactly; it appears to be a feminization of ''[[Telperion]]'', one of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]]. Alternatively, her name could mean "Silver One" (from ''tyelpë'' 'silver' and ''-iën'', a feminine ending). Like all the rulers of Númenor who took their royal titles in Quenya, Telperiën added the prefix ''tar-'' ('high') to her name when she received the [[Sceptre]].
