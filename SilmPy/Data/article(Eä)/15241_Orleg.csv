'''Orleg''' was an outlaw of [[Túrin|Túrin's]] band of men in the [[First Age]]. He was a member of the [[Gaurwaith]] or Wolf-men who hunted in the woods of [[Taeglin]]. When the group passed south under the leadership of Túrin they came upon a group of [[Orcs]] who were raiding southward. Túrin and Orleg were scouting the land when they were discovered by the Orcs and hunted westward toward the wilds of [[Nargothrond]]. There Orleg was slain by many arrows but Túrin escaped and it was a long road to return to the outlaw's camp.<ref>{{CH|6}}, pp. 110-111</ref>
