'''Girion''' (d. {{TA|2770}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>) was the last Lord of [[Dale]]. 
==History==
Girion was a [[Men of Dale|Man of Dale]] and became lord of the city. Not much can be said about his life and rule, other than he had a wife, and at least two sons.<ref name="Fire">{{H|14}}</ref>

He possessed a [[Necklace of Girion|Necklace]] made of five hundred emeralds. When the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] forged a coat of dwarf-linked rings, presumably of [[mithril]], for his eldest son, Girion gave the necklace to the Dwarves as a payment.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>  

He witnessed the arrival of [[Smaug]] when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] assaulted Dale and the neighbouring [[Dwarves|dwarf]] realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Girion was killed during that event but his wife and child escaped down the [[River Running]].<ref name="Fire">{{H|14}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Many years later, his descendant [[Bard]] was still living in [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]]. He took revenge upon the dragon by slaying him with [[Black Arrow|an arrow]].<ref name="Fire"/> His necklace was found among the dragon's hoard.

==Etymology==
Although the names of Dale are [[Norse]], ''Girion'' seems to be a [[Sindarin]] name. The meaning is not clear but the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' give a [[Noldorin]] [[Sundocarme|root]] GIR ("quiver, shudder"),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 358</ref> which might be related.

:Briefly seen in flashback to the [[Sack of Erebor]] in both the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' and in ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', Girion is portrayed by [[Luke Evans]], who also played Girion's descendant [[Bard]].<ref name=ComingSoon>[http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/12/09/84485-luke-evans-played-his-ancestor-girion-of-dale/ "Luke Evans played Bard’s ancestor, Girion of Dale"], theonering.net, 9 December 2013 (accessed 29 January 2014) </ref>

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Girion's name is explained as being the Elvish interpretation of "Geirjarn". The first Lord of Dale was an archer who saved King [[Thrór]] from [[Orcs]] and was rewarded with the rule of Dale and a Black Arrow for him and each of his heirs.
