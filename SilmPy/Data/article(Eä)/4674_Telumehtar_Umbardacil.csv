}}'''Telumehtar''' ({{TA|1632}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|1850|n}}, aged 218 years) was the twenty-eighth [[King of Gondor]]. He succeeded his father [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] in {{TA|1798}}.<ref name="south">{{App|South}}</ref>

==History==
In the early years of [[Telumehtar]]'s reign over [[Gondor]], his country's coasts were still prey to assaults from the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], under the command of the descendants of [[Castamir]].  

Recalling the death of [[Minardil]] and rankled by the insolence of the Corsairs, Telumehtar resolved to put an end to these attacks.  In {{TA|1810}} he marshaled an assault of his own. In a great victory, the Corsairs were driven out of Umbar, which was captured for Gondor, the last descendants of Castamir were killed.

Telumehtar added the epithet '''Umbardacil''', "Victor over Umbar", to his name to commemorate his victory. The [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]] was held by Gondor throughout Telumehtar's reign, but was lost soon after his death.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
