The '''High Hay''' (also called '''The Hedge''') was a barrier hedge planted by the [[Hobbits]] of [[Buckland]] to protect their land from the [[Old Forest]]. 

== Appearance ==
Constantly tended, it was thick and tall, and ran for over twenty miles.  At the north end the Hay ran down to the river-bank close to the [[Brandywine Bridge]].  Nearby was an opening in the barrier, the [[Buckland Gate|North Gate]], where gate-guards were posted day and night.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref> From there the Hay wound southwards to the confluence of the [[Baranduin|Brandywine River]] and the [[Withywindle]]. East of [[Crickhollow]] there was a private entrance that the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] used, which was a brick-lined tunnel under the Hay with a gate of thick-set iron bars on the forest side.<ref name="Old Forest">{{FR|I6}}</ref> At the south end there was either another gate or the hedge ended before the meeting of the two rivers because the town of [[Breredon]] was on the Old Forest side of the barrier.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

== History ==
The High Hay was planted sometime after the foundation of [[Buckland]] ({{TA|2340}}) but many generations before the [[War of the Ring]].

When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his [[Travellers|travelling hobbits]] journeyed from [[Bag End]] to [[Rivendell]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] told that long ago the trees attacked the Hedge by planting themselves right by it and leaning over it.  In response, the Bucklanders cut down hundreds of trees to make a great bonfire in [[Bonfire Glade]] and burned a long strip next to the Hay on its east side.<ref name="Old Forest"/>
