'''Stone-trolls''' were a race of [[trolls]] in the service of [[Sauron]]. Not much is known of these creatures, except that they inhabited the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]] and that they spoke a "debased form of the [[Westron|Common Speech]]".<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref> It is possible that they were not actually living beings, but mere counterfeits made by Melkor, and they would return to their stone images once exposed to the light of the Sun.<ref>{{L|153}}</ref>

[[Bert]], [[Tom]], and [[William|Bill]] — the trolls encountered by [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his companions on their journey to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] — were likely of this kind, as they spoke [[Westron]].<ref>{{H|2}}</ref><ref name=RF>[[Robert Foster]] (1978), ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 366</ref>

In {{TA|3018}}, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam Gamgee]] composed the humorous poem "[[The Stone Troll]]", about [[Tom Bombadil]] visiting an old troll gnawing on the bones of [[Tim]].<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref><ref>{{AB|7}}</ref><ref name=RF/>
==Inspiration==
The three trolls attempt to trap and carry the Dwarves in bags. This is reminiscent to the scene in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'' where Grendel carries his human prey in a glove.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>
