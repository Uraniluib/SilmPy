The '''Faring Forth''' is part of a theory surrounding the [[Dagor Dagorath|Battle of Rôs]]. The Faring Forth would occur when [[Tol Eressëa]] would be drawn back across [[Belegaer|the sea]] to the [[Great Lands]]. The [[elves]] would then march across the land seeking their lost kindred, and asking for aid of [[men]].<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, p. 285</ref>
