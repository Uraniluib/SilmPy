'''Wolf-Sauron''' was the name given to the dreadful wolf-shape that [[Sauron]] took when he went from [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] ("Isle of Werewolves") to do battle with [[Huan]], the [[Hound of Valinor]]. 

According to prophecy, Huan would not die until he had encountered the greatest of all wolves, so Sauron contrived to take on that role and defeat the hound. He failed, as the greatest of all wolves was not Wolf-Sauron, but [[Carcharoth]] of [[Angband]], and through [[LÃºthien]]'s magic and Huan's valour Sauron was defeated. Surrendering his tower on Tol-in-Gaurhoth, he fled in the form of a [[vampire]] into the woods of [[Dorthonion]], and was not seen again until after the [[War of Wrath]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>
