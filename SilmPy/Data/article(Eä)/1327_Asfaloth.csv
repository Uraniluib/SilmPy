'''Asfaloth''' was the white [[Horses|horse]] of [[Glorfindel]].

==History==
Asfaloth was ridden by Glorfindel during the search for [[Aragorn]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]] on their way to [[Rivendell]].  After he found them and the [[Nazg√ªl|Black Riders]] attacked, Glorfindel dismounted and placed [[Frodo Baggins]] (the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]) on its back, then ordered it forward to safety at the [[Ford of Bruinen]].  Asfaloth was a remarkably fast horse, outpacing the black steeds of the Black Riders, even so that it reached the Fords first.<ref name="Flight"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Asfaloth'' means "Sunlit Foam" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[as]]'' and ''[[faloth]]''.<Ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In answer to a question from [[Rhona Beare]] in 1958, Tolkien admitted that Glorfindel would not have used a bridle and bit when riding Asfaloth; instead he would only have used an ornamental headstall with a plume, jewels, and small bells.  He assured her that he would change ''bridle and bit'' to ''headstall'' in future editions, a change that was made.<ref>{{L|211}}</ref>
