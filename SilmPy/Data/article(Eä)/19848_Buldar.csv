'''Buldar''' was a [[Men|man]] living in [[Agar]] during the [[Second Age]], father of [[Hazad Longbeard]] and grandfather of [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]], hero of the unfinished story bearing the same name. 

== Life ==
During his days of youth, Buldar fought in the army of the North King in the valley of [[Ishmalog]] and came back home with "a wound, a sword and a woman". The latter, named [[Elmar]], he wedded mostly against her wish and had many sons, of which the youngest was Hazad.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In a penciled note added to the manuscripts, J.R.R. Tolkien proposed that Buldar should be left out of the story and Elmar to be Hazad's wife. However, in the published version, this change did not occur.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}, note 5</ref>
