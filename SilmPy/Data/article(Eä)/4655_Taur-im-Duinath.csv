==Etymology==

The name ''Taur-im-Duinath'' literally means "forest between rivers" in [[Sindarin]], consisting of ''[[taur]]'' ("forest") + ''[[im]]'' ("between") + ''[[duin]]'' ("river") + ''[[-ath]]'' (collective plural suffix).<ref name=VT47>{{VT|47a}}, p. 38</ref><ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 14 December 2011)</ref>

In the revised version of the second ''Silmarillion'' map appears the names '''''Taur i Melegyrn''''' ("Forest of the Great Trees") and '''''Taur na Chardh√Æn''''' ("Forest of the Southern Silence") for this region,<ref>{{WJ|11}}, p. 185</ref> although it is unknown if they were intended as replacements or alternative names.<ref name=VT47/>
