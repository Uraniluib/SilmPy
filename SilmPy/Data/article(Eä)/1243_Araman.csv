'''Araman''' was the northern coastland of [[Aman]], north of [[Valinor]], that lay outside the mountain-fence of the [[Pelóri]]. It was deserted, mountainous and frozen because of its neighbouring with [[Helcaraxë]] which joined it with [[Beleriand]].
==History==
This was the way [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (passing through [[Oiomúrë]]), and later the [[Noldor]] took into Exile.  In Araman the host of the Noldor heard the [[Doom of Mandos]], delivered by a dark figure standing upon a high rock.  Upon hearing the prophecy the host divided, with the followers of [[Fëanor]] pressing onward while those of [[Finarfin]] turned back.  Later, when Fëanor and his kin burnt their ships at [[Losgar]], [[Fingolfin]] in Araman knew that he had been betrayed and that their only course was to march across the Helcaraxë.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Araman'' is [[Quenya]] for "outside Aman", consisting of ''[[Ar#Quenya|ar]]'' + ''[[Aman#Etymology|Aman]]''.<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''ar-'' and ''mān-''</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/qlist.htm|articlename=Quenya Corpus Wordlist|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=16 February 2013}}</ref>
