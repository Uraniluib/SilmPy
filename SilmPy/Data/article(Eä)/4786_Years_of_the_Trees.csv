{{History of Arda}}
The '''Years of the Trees''', also called the '''Days of Bliss (of Valinor)''' or the '''Noontide of Valinor'''<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>, were the long years that lay between the founding of [[Valinor]] and its [[Darkening of Valinor|Darkening]]. During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], but [[Middle-earth]] lay in the [[Great Darkness]].<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>

The Years of the Trees preceded the [[Years of the Sun]], and perhaps belonged to, or at least overlapped with, the [[First Age]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "First Age"</ref>
==History==
[[File:Roger Garland - Two Trees of Valinor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roger Garland]] - ''Two Trees of Valinor'']]
Long before the [[Elves]] awoke, [[Yavanna]] created the Two Trees of Valinor to give light to realm of the [[Valar]]. The Trees first flowered after 3500 Valian Years had passed.<ref name=Annals>{{MR|P2}}</ref> This period began at the [[Opening Hour]], when [[Telperion]] first started to bloom alone; on the second hour, the [[First Day]] begun, and with it, the beginning of the [[Count of Time]].<ref name=BegDays>{{S|1}}</ref> 

So began a reign of peace in Valinor, but Middle-earth was lit by starlight alone, and [[Morgoth|Melkor]] worked in the depths of [[Utumno]] in the north of the World and its dominion expanded to the south, while [[Sauron]] was appointed lieutenant in [[Angband]], anticipating an assault from the West.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> It is not told how long this time lasted, just that 'the ages drew on'; this period would have lasted roughly 10,500 years. It was during this period that [[Aulë]] made the [[Dwarves]], and at [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]'s direction, set them to sleep until the creation of the [[stars]] and the [[Awakening of the Elves]].
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Oromë espies the first Elves.jpg|thumb|Anke Eißmann - ''Oromë espies the first Elves'']]
When [[Oromë]] discovered that the Elves had awoken at [[Cuiviénen]], great changes came about. The Valar made a [[War for Sake of the Elves]] against [[Morgoth|Melkor]]; Utumno was destroyed and Melkor brought in chains to Valinor. The Valar also summoned the Elves to dwell in their land, and many answered this summons.

A period of three ages (about 2,900 years) followed. [[Chaining of Melkor|Melkor was imprisoned]] in the [[Halls of Mandos]], and the Valar and [[Eldar]] dwelt together in the light of the Trees. In the darkness of Middle-earth, the Dark Elves who had not journeyed to Valinor still dwelt, and the Fathers of the Dwarves stirred. Men would not appear until some time after the end of the Years of the Trees.

These Years came to an end when [[Manwë]] released Melkor from his imprisonment. For a time, the [[Dark Lord]] pretended friendship with the Eldar, but he turned back to the darkness. After shining for 1495 Valian Years,<ref name=Annals/> they were destroyed by [[Ungoliant]]. During the [[Long Night]], they stole the [[Silmarils]] and fled back to the north of Middle-earth. Seeking revenge, [[Fëanor]] led a great part of the [[Noldor]] out of Valinor and back to Beleriand.

So the Years of the Trees came to an end. At this time, the Valar made the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] to give light to the World, and after 5000 Valian Years had passed,<ref name=Annals/> the [[Years of the Sun]] began.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In Tolkien's latest writings where Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Two Trees held the light of the untainted Sun rather than that of the [[Two Lamps]], which did not ever truly exist. In this version of Arda's history, rather than an absence of a Sun or Moon, the darkness that covered Arda was instead due to a great shadow designed by Melkor to spread over the northern lands of Middle-earth, blotting out the light of the Moon and stars and causing day to be a dim twilight at full.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>
