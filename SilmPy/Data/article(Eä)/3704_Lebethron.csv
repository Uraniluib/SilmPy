'''Lebethron''' was a hardwood tree that grew in [[Ithilien]].

==History==
Lebethron was said to be fair, and beloved by the woodworkers of Gondor.<ref name="XR">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', "[[Journey to the Cross-Roads]]"</ref> The staves given by [[Faramir]] to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] were made of lebethron,<ref name="XR"/> as was the casket, described as made of "black ''lebethron''", in which he brought the [[Crown of Gondor]] to the coronation of [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Steward and the King]]"</ref>

==Etymology==

The name was invented by Tolkien at the time of writing, as ''melinon'', then ''lebendron'' and finally ''lebethras''. It was replaced by ''lebethron'' on the fair manuscript copy.<ref>{{WR}} pp. 180 and 207.</ref>

According to a later source, ''lebethron'' was a [[Gondor Sindarin]] word. The first element, ''[[lebeth]]'', was related to [[Quenya]] ''[[lepsë]]'',<ref name="PE17">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Gilson]] (ed.), "Words, Phrases & Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings''", published in [[Parma Eldalamberon]] [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|#17]] (July [[2007]]), page 89.</ref> "finger".<ref name="etym">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]], ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', "[[The Etymologies]]"</ref> The second element was said to be derived from ''[[oron]]'', "tree", though a later addition also ties it to the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[RUN]], "rub, grind, smooth, polish". In this light, the tree was named ''lebethorn'', and the wood of the tree ''lebethron'', and the two words merged into one over time.<ref name="PE17"/>
