'''Lótessë''' was the name for the month of the year (''[[asta]]'') that followed the month [[Víressë]] and preceded the month [[Nárië]]. It was the fifth month in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]]. After the introduction of [[New Reckoning]], the year started with Víressë so Lótessë became the second month.<ref name=app/>

''Lótessë'' in the Kings' Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards' Reckoning) corresponded to [[Thrimidge]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[22 April]] through [[21 May]]).

==Etymology==
The word includes the word ''[[lótë]]'', "blossom". Lótessë was the [[Quenya]] name inherited from [[Númenor]] and traditionally used by the [[Westron]]-speaking peoples. The [[Dúnedain]] themselves however used the [[Sindarin]] name of the month, [[Lothron]].<ref name=app>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
As the Númenorean calendars seem to be based on the [[Wikipedia:French Republican Calendar|French Republican Calendar]], the name and meaning of the month corresponds to the month [[Wikipedia:Floréal|Floréal]], meaning "flowery".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 151</ref>
