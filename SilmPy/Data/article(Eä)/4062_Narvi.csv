'''Narvi''' (mid-[[Second Age]]) was a great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] craftsman.<ref name=UT>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

==History==
Narvi lived in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] during the height of its glory. He formed a friendship with the [[Noldor|Elf]]-lord [[Celebrimbor]], the master artificer of neighboring [[Eregion]]. Together they made the mighty [[Doors of Durin]] that guarded the [[West-gate of Moria|West-gate]] of the Dwarven city.<ref name=UT/><ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] used the spelling ''Narf[i]''.<ref>{{TI|IX}}, p. 188</ref> ''[[Wikipedia:Narfi|Narfi]]'' is an [[Old Norse]] name and character appearing in the ''Prose Edda'' (there also spelled ''Narvi''), and the meaning of the name is unknown.<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 223</ref>

Possibly the name is provided as a translation of the Dwarf's "outer" name from some [[Mannish]] language of the [[Northmen]] of the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref><ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In a linguistic manuscript, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] placed the character Narvi at an earlier time in the history of [[Arda]] (apparently because of linguistic considerations), "''before [[Durin]]'s death''".<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 38</ref>
