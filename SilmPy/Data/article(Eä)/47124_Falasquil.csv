In early stage of the [[legendarium]], '''Falasquil''' (the "beach of peace")<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 24</ref> was a  name given by the [[Noldoli]] to [[Tuor|Tuor's]] dwelling place near [[Mithrim]]. The floor of the cove was white sand; the walls were embellished by Tuor with animals, birds, trees and flowers. His favourite carving was a swan, which eventually became the emblem of his house. Tuor dwelt there for a while, until Ulmo appointed him with the mission to reach [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 151-2</ref>
