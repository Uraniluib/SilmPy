The '''Sleep of Yavanna''' was a period of the very ancient times of [[Arda]], marked by darkness and stillness of nature.
==Background==
The two great [[Two Lamps|Lamps]] of the [[Valar]] which were giving light to the World during the [[Spring of Arda]] were destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] along with the Valar's dwellings on [[Almaren]], driving them away into the [[Uttermost West|West]].<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> Thus the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]] were left in darkness, and [[Yavanna]] protected the creatures living there by setting them to sleep and they did not grow or age until light should come again.<ref name=c3>{{S|3}}</ref> 
==History==
While the Valar were preparing the bliss of [[Valinor]] bathed in the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], [[Middle-earth]] was in darkness and silence, fell beasts of hideous form multiplied in [[Utumno]]. It was [[Ulmo]] who did not forsake the Outer Lands and kept the earth alive. Yavanna also came healing the hurts of Melkor, and [[Orome]] hunted monsters, and kept the shadows at bay while blowing the [[Valar√≥ma]], albeit temporarily.<ref name=s1/>

It was during the Sleep of Yavanna when [[Aule]] in his impatience created the [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Seven Fathers]] of the [[Dwarves]] under the mountains of [[Middle-earth]]. As Middle-earth was dark and dangerous, Aule made his children robust and sturdy.<ref>{{S|2}}</ref>

[[Varda]] created new [[stars]] and the [[Elves]] awoke. Only [[Dwarves]] and Elves roamed the Middle-earth which was lit only by the stars, and most creatures were sleeping.<ref name=c3/> Most life could be found in [[Doriath]] under the guidance of [[Melian]]; and in the North, where [[Orcs]] and other creatures of the Enemy multiplied.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Sleep of Yavanna".</ref>

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the death of the Two Trees, it was the rising of the [[Sun]] that finally returned light to Middle-earth and a [[Second Spring of Arda]].
