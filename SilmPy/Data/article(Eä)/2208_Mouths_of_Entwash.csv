{{disambig-two|the delta of the river [[Entwash]]|[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]] supplement|[[Mouths of the Entwash]]}}
The '''Mouths of Entwash''' was a mighty delta formed where the River [[Entwash]] met the [[Anduin]]. The delta measured a hundred miles from the splitting of the river to its final inflow into [[Anduin]]. Travelers were advised to avoid the marshy lands.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref> 

Although the areas west of Anduin belonged to [[Rohan]], the splitting of Entwash was considered the border, so the delta itself was part of [[Gondor]]. 

So great was the inrush of Entwash that Anduin could not carry all its water, and so a marshland formed on the Anduin's eastern bank, called [[Wetwang]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>
