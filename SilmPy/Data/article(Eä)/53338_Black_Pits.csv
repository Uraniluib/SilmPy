The '''Black Pits''' were dungeons of torment under [[Barad-d√ªr]].<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 603</ref> They were known to [[Shagrat]] who cursed "The Black Pits take that filthy rebel [[Gorbag]]!" after the two orc companies had had a disastrous fight in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref name="asdf">{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

Shagrat also told his underling [[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga]] that they both would "be for the Black Pits" if the news of the happenings in the Tower would not get through to [[Sauron]].<ref name="asdf" />
