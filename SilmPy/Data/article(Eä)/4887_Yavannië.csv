'''Yavannië''' ([[Ivanneth]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the ninth month of the year in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] of [[Gondor]], following [[Úrimë]], and preceding the month of [[Narquelië]]. In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the sixth month of the year. In the Stewards' Reckoning, ''Yavannië'' preceded the autumn feast of [[Yáviérë]]. 

''Yavannië'' in the Kings' Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards' Reckoning) corresponded to [[Halimath]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[23 August]] through [[21 September]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
