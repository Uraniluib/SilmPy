'''Mermaids''', or water spirits, were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in the earliest versions of the tales of [[Arda]] and linguistic writings of the [[Eldar]].<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, ''passim''</ref><ref name=PE12>{{PE|12}}</ref> Other names for these creatures were '''foam-maidens''', '''foam-fays''', '''foam-riders''',<ref name=MC>{{MC|Secret}}, pp. 216-7</ref> and '''nymphs'''.<ref name=PE12/>

==Characteristics==

The mermaids were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser [[Ainur|Ainu]] spirits: [[sylphs]] (spirits of the air), [[sprites|sprites]] (spirits of the earth), and water spirits.<ref name=LT1-66>{{LT1|III}}, p.66</ref>

In poems, the foam-fays are described as having "blossom-white hair" shining "in the light of the sun", "pale arms on the sea's bosom", and to be "chanting wild songs".<ref name=MC/> They apparently lived in [[Caverns of the Oaritsi|caverns]] in the sea.<ref>{{LT1|IXn}}, p. 227</ref>

Ui (the precursor of [[Uinen]]) was given the title "Queen of Mermaids".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 263</ref><ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 97</ref>
==Names and divisions==

A basic division of two groups of water spirits, with their [[Elvish]] names, are given as follow:

*'''''Oarni''''' (troop of [[Ossë]]): "spirits of the sea"; also '''''Oaritsi''''' (from ''oaris'', "mermaid")<ref name=LT1Index>{{LT1|Index}}</ref>
*'''''Falmaríni''''' and '''''Wingildi''''' (troop of [[Ossë]]): "spirits of the sea-foam"<ref name=LT1Index/> (also '''''wingildin''''', "foam-maidens, foam-fays"<ref name=MC/>; '''''wingild-''''' "nymph",<ref name=PE12/> or "foam-maiden"<ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 100</ref>; ''wingi'' "mermaid, foam-maid"<ref name=PE21/>; and ''wingil'' "sea-nymph"<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 42</ref>)

Also mentioned are ''flathwin'' or ''-nir'' "foam fay", and ''nendil'', ''nennil'' "waterfay".<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref> A [[Qenya]] gloss is given as ''nindari'' ("river-maid, nymph").<ref name=PE21>{{PE|21}}, p. 14</ref>

==The later legendarium==

Mermaids are not mentioned in the later versions of the [[legendarium]]. Many of the classes of beings references in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' were superseded by the concept of the [[Maiar]], which were not introduced until the reworking of the [[Annals of Valinor]] into the [[Annals of Aman]].<ref name="MRP2b">{{MR|P2b}}</ref>

==Inspiration==

[[Patrick H. Wynne]] and [[Christopher Gilson]] have noted that Tolkien's use of nymphs (and related spirits) is likely influenced by [[Wikipedia:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]]'s chart of four elementals: ''sylphs'' (air), ''pygmies'' or ''gnomes'' (earth), ''nymphs'' (water), and ''salamanders'' (fire).<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 8</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:The Ally card "Nenseldë the Wingild", portraying a unique character, is playable at Dol Amroth.
