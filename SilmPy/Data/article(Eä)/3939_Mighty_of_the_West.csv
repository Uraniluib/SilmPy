'''Mighty of the West''' was a title used once, in the quotation given above, to refer to [[Tuor]] the son of [[Huor]]. Its exact meaning is ambiguous: it appears in a passage that discusses Tuor's relationship with his descendants, the [[Númenóreans]], and so we have treated it here as an epithet for that division of Mankind.

It might conceivably, though, refer to the [[Valar]], though it seems unlikely that such a comparison would be made of a mortal Man.
