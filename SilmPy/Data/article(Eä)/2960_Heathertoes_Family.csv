'''Heathertoes''' was one of the strange botanical names preferred by the people of [[Bree]]. 

==Etymology==
While ''heather'' is an element that appears in English real-life surnames, Heathertoes has no parallel in English. 

Tolkien suggested that the name refers to a joke of the [[Big Folk]] for the [[Little Folk]], who walked bootless and collected heather, twigs and leaves between their toes.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 759</ref>

==Men or Hobbits?==
The narrative of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' doesn't make clear if the family was of [[Men of Bree|Men]] or of [[Hobbits]]. The above etymology suggests that it was a name given to Hobbits by Men. 

However in the narrative the name is listed among those used by the [[Men]],<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> and [[Mat Heathertoes]], who is named as one of the casualties of Bree during fighting there, appears to be listed among Men rather than Hobbits.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>
