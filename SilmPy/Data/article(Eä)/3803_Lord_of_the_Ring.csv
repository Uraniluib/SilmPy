'''Lord of the Ring''' or '''Lord of the Rings''' was a title for [[Sauron]], the master of [[the One Ring]]. The singular form appeared only once, uttered by [[Peregrin Took]], who was ignorant of its meaning. The plural form appeared only thrice; once in [[Gandalf]]'s correction of the above mishap, once by [[Glorfindel]] during the [[Council of Elrond]], and once by Gandalf there.<ref>
