'''Nornhabar''' ("[[Dwarrowdelf]]") is an [[Elvish]] name of [[Moria#Names|Khazad-dûm]] (later known as [[Moria]]) in [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]] manuscripts in the 1950s (cf. [[The History of Middle-earth]] XI, p. 206, 209).

Later on, in the essay [[Quendi and Eldar]] ''Nornhabar'' was replaced by ''[[Hadhodrûd]]'' which was quite immediately changed to ''[[Hadhodrond]]''> - a form that entered into the printed [[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]] (cf. ibid., p. 386, 419 [note 21]).

The elements of the [[Sindarin]] name are likely ''[[Norno]]'' "Dwarf" (< ''[[norna]]'' adj. "stiff, tough"){{fact}} and ''[[habar|sabar]]'' "mine".
