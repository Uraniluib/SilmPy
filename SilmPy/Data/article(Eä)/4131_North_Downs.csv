The '''North Downs''' were a range of hills in the northern part of [[Eriador]], east of the [[Hills of Evendim]] and north of the [[Weather Hills]]. From their northernmost point the hills extended in a south-westerly direction. At the southern end was [[Fornost Erain]], the ancient city of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnedain of the North]], and the northern terminus of the [[North-South Road]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In the early [[Second Age]] the Downs were occupied by [[Men]], as well as [[Weather Hills]] and the [[Lake Evendim]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> In the year {{SA|600}} [[Vëantur]] first returned to [[Middle-earth]] from [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Upon hearing that some of their distant kin had come, these [[Middle Men]] petitioned [[Gil-galad]] to meet the mariners. Twelve men came and rejoiced to meet the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 3</ref>

When the kingdom of [[Arnor]] was established in {{SA|3320}}<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> the North Downs were incorporated into the realm.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> When Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the frontier between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]] was the Weather Hills;<ref name="North">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain''</ref> this frontier may have extended along the eastern edge of the North Downs.

When [[Angmar]] attacked Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the new King [[Araphor]] repelled the enemy from [[Fornost Erain]] and the North Downs, with help from [[Cirdan]].<ref name="North"/>

In {{TA|1974|n}} before the end of winter the [[Witch-king]] came down from Angmar and [[Fall of Fornost|captured Fornost]]. King [[Arvedui]] held out on the North Downs until he and some of his guard were driven to the north.<ref name="North"/> Arriving late, [[Eärnur]] answered summons from Arvedui in {{TA|1975|n}} with a massive fleet from [[Gondor]] which disgorged a host marching eastwards. Unaware of his peril the Witch-king marched out to meet the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|mighty combined army]] of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] in the plains between the [[Hills of Evendim]] and the North Downs. In the ensuing [[Battle of Fornost]] the forces of Angmar were routed and then destroyed, although the Witch-king himself escaped.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Although the kingdom of Angmar had been defeated and destroyed, so too had Arthedain come to an end. Fornost was abandoned and became a place of fear, acquiring the name Deadmen's Dike.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Other than visits by [[Rangers of the North]], the North Downs remained uninhabited for the remainder of the [[Third Age]]. In the [[Fourth Age]] though men may have returned to the North Downs; most likely [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] visited Fornost when he came north to dwell by Lake Evendim for awhile in {{FoA|15}}.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The North Downs is one of the major regions of the game and one of the largest to date. North from [[Bree-land]] the [[Greenway]] is leading to [[Fornost Erain]] in the north-western corner of the map. Major towns are '''Trestlebridge''', a small town of men from Bree, '''Esteldín''', an [[Arnor]]ian ruin inhabited by [[Rangers of the North|Dúnedain Rangers]], and '''Othrikar''', a mining outpost of the [[Longbeards]].
: As of fall of {{TA|3018}} the North Downs is in the state of war, as a new power in [[Angmar]] is sending its minions south. '''Nan Wathren''' is a rocky valley occupied by Orcs besieging Trestlebridge, the farms of '''Annundir''' have been ravaged by [[Goblins]], [[Dourhands]] roam the '''Nan Amlug''', but the biggest threat of all is an entire army of Orcs, Wargs and Trolls gathering its strength in '''Dol Dinen'''.
