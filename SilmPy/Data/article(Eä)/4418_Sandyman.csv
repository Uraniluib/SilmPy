'''Sandyman''' was the miller of [[Hobbiton]].
__NOTOC__
==History==
Sandyman owned and ran the [[Old Mill]] in [[Hobbiton]] around {{SR|1401}} and well before.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> [[Gaffer Gamgee|The Gaffer]] was not very fond of Sandyman, or his habits of telling tall tales and having quick judgment of others.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Some time before the [[War of the Ring]], Sandyman died and passed his mill on to his son [[Ted Sandyman|Ted]].

==Inspiration==
Possibly the miller at [[Sarehole]] Mill, Warwickshire, England

{{quote|I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{FR|Foreword}}</ref>}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:He is given the full name Carl Sandyman, and is the mischievous son of the current miller. He hid his father's hammer and nails. [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] has to retrieve them before the bridge over the Water can be repaired.
