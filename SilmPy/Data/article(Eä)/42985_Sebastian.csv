'''Sebastian''' is the name of [[Radagast]]'s hedgehog in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''. Radagast discovers a sickness falling upon [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] while just outside his [[Rhosgobel|home]] one day, seeing several plants and animals that are dead or dying -- Sebastian being one of the latter. He brings the hedgehog back in an attempt to revive him, but none of his home remedies work. In the process, several large [[spiders]] begin to descend on [[Rhosgobel]]. Radagast decides to use his [[magic]] on Sebastian, and when he finishes his incantation of the spell, the spiders return to the [[Dol Guldur|place]] from whence they came. Meanwhile, the spell has cured Sebastian, and he appears completely back to normal.

Sebastian is featured in the figurine "Radagast the Brown with Sebastian" released for ''[[The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game]]'', displayed hiding by the feet of Radagast.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/productDetail.jsp?catId=cat970003a&prodId=prod1870030a|articlename=Radagast the Brown with Sebastian|dated=|website=[http://www.games-workshop.com/ Games-Workshop.com]|accessed=30 January 2013}}</ref>
