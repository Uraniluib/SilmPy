'''Oromet''' was a hill near [[Andúnië]] and the western shores of [[Númenor]].  It was here that the [[King of Númenor]], [[Tar-Minastir]] (whose name meant "Tower Watcher"), built a high tower where he could spend many days gazing westward.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Minastir</ref>  Well over a thousand years later [[Tar-Palantir]] often visited the tower upon Oromet in the vain hope of seeing [[Tol Eressëa]] or at least some ship coming from the west.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name is obviously [[Quenya]]<ref name=guide/><ref name=arda>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|website=Arda}}</ref> and includes the [[Elvish]] [[root]] for "mountain".<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry "orod"</ref>

The meaning is obscure<ref name=arda/> but it has been suggested that the name means "last mountain".<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 309</ref> Cf. the Elvish root MET "end".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 373</ref>
