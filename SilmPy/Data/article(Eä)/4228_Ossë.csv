'''Ossë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈosːe]}}) was a [[Maiar|Maia]] of the [[Inner Seas]] associated with [[Ulmo]]. 
==Attributes==
Ossë is a vassal of Ulmo, but he loves the winds and prefers the coasts and isles of [[Middle-earth]]<ref name=s3/> to the deeps of his master. There is some darkness and violence in his spirit, presumably after his seduction by Melkor, and still enjoys raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo; only his spouse, [[Uinen]] can restrain his wild urges. He is friend to mariners, but they don't trust his unpredictable temperament.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIc}}</ref>
==History==
In the early days of [[Arda]], Ossë turned to [[Morgoth|Melkor]] for a time, but Uinen brought him back to the loyalty of Ulmo. However, Ossë's wild and wilful nature was still evident despite remaining loyal to Ulmo.<ref name=vala/>

During the [[Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to [[Valinor]], Ossë was sent to befriend the [[Lindar]], the clan of the Eldar who lingered by the shores of [[Belegaer]] on their way, and he taught them sea-lore and sea-music. When Ulmo returned with the floating island for them to resume their trip to the west, Ossë (who loved the shores of Middle-earth) did not wish to part with his friends; he persuaded some, like [[Círdan]], to remain there, at the [[Falas]] and the [[Bay of Balar]]. These afterwards became the [[Falathrim]].<ref name=s3/>

As Ulmo ferried the floating island with [[Olwë]] and his Lindar to [[Eldamar]], they heard Ossë's song and begged Ulmo to stop off the shore, which he did. Ossë fastened the island to the bottom, and it became [[Tol Eressëa]], the lonely isle off the [[Bay of Eldamar]]. However soon the [[Falmari]] of the island longed for the splendour and [[Light of Valinor]] and wished to see their kindred there. Grieving, Ossë submitted to the will of the Valar and Ulmo, and taught them ship-building and offered them [[swans]] to draw them to Valinor.<ref name=s3>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

With his master, Ossë often visited [[Nevrast]] and the feet of Mount [[Taras]] in [[Middle-earth]], and many [[Sindar]] were concentrated to that place.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

After the [[First Kinslaying]], [[Olwë]] called upon Ossë against the [[Noldor]], but he came not, as the Valar did not wish to hinder the [[Flight of the Noldor]] with violence.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref>

After the [[Valar]] pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], Ossë helped guard the shores of [[Beleriand]] to keep the ships of the Noldor from reaching [[Valinor]]. His storms had a part in wrecking all the ships that they sent, and only one [[Elves|Elf]] from among their crews survived, by the will of Ulmo: [[Voronwë]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> 

In the [[Second Age]] he rose the island of [[Elenna]] ([[Númenor]]) from the depths of the Sea.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

==Etymology==
At least two explanations exist for the name ''Ossë''. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', it is understood as the [[Qenya]] word ''osse'' ("terror"), deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[GOS]] ("dread").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 359</ref> 

A later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish origin, deriving from [[Valarin]] ''Oš(o)šai'' ("spuming, foaming").<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 400</ref> The same later note mentions that Ossë's [[Sindarin]] names were '''''Gaerys''''' (also containing the S. element ''gaer'' "dread")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''gaer''</ref> and '''''Yssion'''''.<ref name=WJ/> 

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In older versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as well as the [[Annals of Aman]], Ossë and his spouse [[Uinen]] were Valar in their own right, and often opposed the will of Ulmo.

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Ossë is referred to as ''Saefrea'' "Sea-ruler"<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> reflecting his status as a Vala (Fréa).

In that conception, Ossë is the source of the name ''Balar'' in place-names such as [[Cape Balar]], [[Isle of Balar]] and [[Bay of Balar]], which he often visited, and from which all [[Beleriand]] was named.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry BAL</ref><ref>{{GA|2}}</ref>

''Ossë'' was also the name of a [[Tengwa]] similar to Roman c, which apparently had the value ''o''.<ref>{{VT|45}} p.15</ref> However elsewhere, this letter is named ''[[Elwë]]'' and has the value of ''e''. In the [[Mode of Beleriand]] this letter instead has the value ''a''.
