'''Ekkaia''' (also called the '''Encircling Sea''', the '''Outer Sea''', or the '''Outer Ocean''') was the mighty sea that surrounded all the lands of [[Arda]], [[Middle-earth]] and [[Aman]] alike. Its dark waters lapped the western shores of [[Valinor]], and at its distant unknown edge stood the [[Walls of Night]]. [[Ulmo]]'s halls were within the Outer Sea.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>

During their time in Valinor [[Fëanor]] and his sons visited the shores of these waters.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> The [[Helcaraxë]] was the narrow strait between the Outer Sea and [[Belegaer]], where in the chilled waters clashed hills of ice amidst vast fogs of deathly cold.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Ekkaia'', commonly understood to be [[Quenya]],<ref name=Helge/><ref name=quick/> was not explained by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].

[[Helge Fauskanger]] has tried to explain ''Ekkaia'' by deriving it from the unattested form ''et-gaya'' ("out-sea"; cf. ''[[et]]'' "out").<ref name=Helge>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 27 October 2011)</ref>

Robert Ireland links ''Ekkaia'' to the [[Sundocarme|root]] KHAYA ("far, distant"), which appears to include among its derivatives an adverb similar in form: ''ekkaira'' ("far off, far away").<ref name=quick>Robert Ireland, [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/SILM/SILM_CE.html The Silmarillion Dictionary (C-E)] at [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/Tolkien_Dictionary.html A Tolkien Dictionary] (accessed 27 October 2011)</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 364 (entry KHAYA-)</ref>
