'''Golodhinand''' is one of the rejected names of [[Beleriand]] which J.R.R. Tolkien jotted down "on a page of rough working for the opening of the [[The Lay of Leithian|Lay]]" (of Leithian) when he was probably searching for a replacement of Broseliand, used so far.

''[[Golodh]]'' was later the [[Sindarin]] equivalent of [[Quenya]] ''[[Noldo]]''.

All in all there were eight of these names: [[Golodhinand]], [[Nold√≥rinan]], [[Geleriand]], [[Bladorinand]], [[Belaurien]], [[Arsiriand]], [[Lassiriand]], [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{LB|C1}}</ref>
