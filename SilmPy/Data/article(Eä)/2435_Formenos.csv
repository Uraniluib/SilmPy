'''Formenos''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈformenos]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈɸormenos]}}; [[Years of the Trees]] 1490<ref>{{MR|P2j}}, §99</ref> – 1495,<ref>{{MR|P2m}}, §122</ref> inhabited for approx. 50 years) was the stronghold of [[Fëanor]] and his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]] in the north of [[Valinor]], built after his banishment from [[Tirion]]. A great number of the [[Noldor]], including their king [[Finwë]], went with Fëanor into exile.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

Fëanor's treasury was in Formenos, and [[Morgoth|Melkor]] came to the stronghold searching for the [[Silmarils]]. Here he slew Finwë before stealing the jewels and escaping to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Formenos means "Northern Fortress" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[formen]]'' = "north" and ''[[osto]]'' = "fortress").  Its [[Sindarin]] cognate is ''[[Fornost]]'', the name of a different city.
