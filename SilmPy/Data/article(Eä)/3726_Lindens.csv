'''Lindens''' were trees in [[Arda]]. Some of the [[Ents]] looked like lindens.<ref>{{HM|TT}}, "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]"</ref>

Lindens were apparently known for their fair and light leaves: both [[Lúthien]]<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[A Knife in the Dark]]"</ref> and [[Nimrodel]]<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]"</ref> were said in song to move like linden-leaves.
