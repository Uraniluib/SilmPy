[[Doriath]], the ancient [[Elves|Elven]] realm of [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]], was ultimately destroyed by the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. After the [[Dwarves]] had sacked [[Menegroth]] and were slain in [[Ossiriand]] by the [[Laiquendi]], [[Dior]] and his wife, [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]], returned to Doriath to rule. Not long after, [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] died once more, and the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] came to Dior. When the Sons of Fëanor learned this, they sent Curufin as messenger to regain the Silmaril, but Dior refused. So they assaulted Menegroth and killed Dior Eluchíl and his wife, and their two sons. Although three of [[Fëanor]]'s sons died also, Doriath was destroyed forever.
