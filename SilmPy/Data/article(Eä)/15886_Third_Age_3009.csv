* [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]] renew their hunt for [[Gollum]] at intervals during the next eight years, searching in the vales of [[Anduin]], [[Mirkwood]], and  [[Rhovanion]] to the confines of [[Mordor]]. At some time during these years Gollum himself ventured into [[Mordor]], and was captured by [[Sauron]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>
* Death of [[Dudo Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>
==Note==
As of [[2015]], the published version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' includes an entry for the year 3009 that [[Elrond]] called for [[Arwen]] to return to [[Rivendell]]. Following research by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] agrees that this is in error and the correct year should be {{TA|3016}}.<ref>{{webcite|website=HS|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]|articleurl=http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/tolkien-notes-13/|articlename=Tolkien Notes 13|dated=25 December 2015|accessed=26 December 2015}}</ref> Tolkien Gateway reflects this.
