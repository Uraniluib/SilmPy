[[Berúthiel]] was Queen to [[Tarannon Falastur]], the twelfth King of [[Gondor]]. Their marriage was a loveless and childless one, and [[Berúthiel]] spent much of her time in her austere chambers, with her ten fabulous cats. Nine of these were black, and [[Berúthiel]] sent them out to spy for her, while the tenth was white, and watched over the other nine. The Queen was feared and reviled in [[Gondor]], and at last her husband the King banished her from the realm. She was last seen aboard a ship, with all her cats, sailing away into the southern seas.
