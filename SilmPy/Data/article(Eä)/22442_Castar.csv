The '''castar''', or [[Sindarin]] '''mirian''', was the chief currency in [[Gondor]]. A smaller coin was the ''[[tharni]]'' or ''[[canath]]'', a silver coin worth a fourth of the ''castar''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Westron]] ''castar'' bears a striking resemblance to the [[Hobbitish]] word ''[[kast]]'' and [[Rohirric]] ''[[kastu]]'', which mean "[[mathom]]".<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> Sindarin ''mirian'' seems to be derived from ''[[m√Ær]]'', "jewel".
