{{Pronounce|Caranthir.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Caranthir''', the fourth of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], was also the harshest and the quickest to anger. He was known as "Caranthir the Dark".

== History ==
As the other [[Sons of Fëanor]], Caranthir was bound by an [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] to recover his father's [[Silmarils]], which had been stolen by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. This oath took the seven brothers to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[First Age]], where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own [[Elvish]] kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.a

Caranthir's realm was in [[Thargelion]], and was sometimes called ''[[Dor Caranthir]]'' ("Caranthir's Land"). His abode was on the shores of [[Helevorn|Lake Helevorn]]. 

In First Age c. 375, Caranthir rescued [[Haleth]] and her people, the [[Haladin]], as they were besieged by [[Orcs]]. When he saw the valor of [[Men]], he offered the Haladin a fiefdom in his lands to the North. However Haleth, wanting her people to serve no lord, thanked him but removed to the [[Forest of Brethil]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

In the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Caranthir was forced to retreat and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]]. They fled to the south and maintained a watch upon [[Amon Ereb]], aided by the [[Laegil]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

In 463, the [[Easterlings|Easterling]] [[Ulfang]] led his people over the [[Blue Mountains]] and swore allegiance to [[Maedhros]]. They were given land in [[Lothlann]] and became subjects of Caranthir.

In 472, the disaster of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears") occurred, caused by the betrayal of the people of Ulfang. 

In 505, he perished along with his brothers [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] during the [[Second Kinslaying]], the attack by the Sons of Fëanor on [[Menegroth]] to recover a Silmaril from King [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] of [[Doriath]].[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Wife of Caranthir|125px]]

== Etymology ==
Caranthir's [[father-name]] was ''[[Morifinwë]]'', meaning "Dark [[Finwë]]", a reference to his dark hair. The [[Quenya]] word was formed using the noun ''[[more]]'', meaning "blackness", "night" or "dark", which became ''[[mori-]]'' when added to his grandfather's name, Finwë. His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Carnistir]]'', which can be translated as "Red-face". ''[[Carnë]]'' in Quenya means "red" or "scarlet". The name Caranthir is the [[Sindarin]] translation of his mother-name.
