The '''Army of the West''', also '''[[Host of the West]]''' was the great host prepared by the Lords of Gondor and Rohan to march on the [[Black Gate]] after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  

Two days after the council of the [[Last Debate]], a force of 7,000 men left [[Minas Tirith]] on [[16 March|March 16]], {{TA|3019|n}}. Under [[Aragorn]] were 2,000 of those who sailed with him up the [[Anduin]]; under [[Imrahil]] were 3,500 (probably from among the original defenders of the city); under [[Ã‰omer]] were 500 Rohirrim unhorsed, and another 500 horsed; and lastly another 500 horsed Knights of [[Dol Amroth]], [[Rangers of the North]], and the [[Elladan|two]] [[Elrohir|sons]] of [[Elrond]]: 6,000 men on foot and 1,000 on horse.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

When the host reached the [[Cross-roads]], the captains stationed a strong force of archers there, to guard against any attack from the East or South.  Also along the way some 1,000 faint-hearted men who would not approach the Black Gate were commanded to liberate [[Cair Andros]].

The Army of the West fought in the [[Battle of the Morannon]] with less than 6,000 men total, but because of the destruction of [[The One Ring]], they were able to achieve a very decisive victory.  It is not told how many casualties the army suffered though it was apparently few.<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>
