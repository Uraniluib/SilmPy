An '''amloth''' was a crested helm, especially one worn by a [[Elves|Elf]]-lord in battle. The crest was typically of a flower or flowers.

Amloth means "Uprising Flowers" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[am]]'' = "upwards, upon" and ''[[loth]]'' = "flowers"). This style of helm was called ''[[ambalotsÃ«]]'' in [[Quenya]].<ref>{{WJ|Maeglin}}, p. 318</ref>
