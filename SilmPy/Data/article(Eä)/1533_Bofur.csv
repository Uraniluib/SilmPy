'''Bofur''' most likely lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Bofur was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Bofur lived at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
Bofur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are that [[Bombur]] is his brother and [[Bifur]] is his cousin.<ref name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref>  He was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name="Durin"/>  His birth year is also unknown.  However, from [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years"<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that after Thorin had been captured, [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>  Since Fíli was born in {{TA|2859}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Bofur's birth between 2809 and {{TA|2763|n}}, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}}, Bofur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]], wearing a yellow hood.  He asked for mince pies and cheese.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Bofur (along with [[Bifur]]) played a clarinet.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>

In the wolves' glade Bofur shared a pine tree with Bifur, [[Bombur]], and Thorin.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bofur, Bifur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

After the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] both Bofur and Bifur came out fairly dry and not very knocked about, but they lay down and refused to do anything.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Bofur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
At [[Rivendell]] in {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bofur was still alive and living in Erebor.<ref name="Meetings"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Bǫvurr'' appears in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. Its meaning is unknown.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the earliest manuscript fragments of ''The Hobbit'', Bofur and Bifur went into the hall and came back with their walking sticks, which they ''turned into'' clarinets.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 36</ref>  In the published text the two Dwarves came back from the hall with clarinets that they ''had left'' with their walking sticks.<ref name="Party"/>  [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') said that in the earliest phase Tolkien had added fairy tale touches of Dwarven magic to emphasize the uncanny, other-worldly nature of the Dwarves as opposed to Bilbo.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, (iii) ''Dwarven Magic'', p. 54</ref>

Originally, when Bombur needed propping up in [[Mirkwood]] after being cut from the spiders' webbing, it was ''his cousins'' Bofur and Bifur who provided support.<ref>{{HH|Mirkwood}}, p. 313</ref>  In the published story this was changed to Bombur's cousin Bifur and brother Bofur.<ref name="Flies"/>  Also, in the earlier version, when [[Smaug]] first came out and the Dwarves in the valley had to be hauled up to the [[Back Door]], Bifur cried out to save Bombur and Bofur, who were both his ''brothers''.<ref>{{HH|Conversations}}</ref>  In the published text Bifur cried out for his two ''cousins''.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>

In Tolkien's unfinished [[1960]] rewrite of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur, Bofur and Bombur were Thorin's attendants.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[A Well-Planned Party]]", p. 774</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] assumes this made them either courtiers or honor-guard.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[Arrival in Rivendell]]", note 32</ref>

==Notes==
In the earliest partial manuscript of ''The Hobbit'' more of the dialog later assigned to a few of the Dwarves is more evenly distributed.  In the opinion of John Rateliff this streamlining strengthened the story through simplification, but at the cost of relegating some of the Dwarves to obscurity since they barely speak at all.  Bofur is one of these "silenced" members of the company.<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, (i) ''The Lost Opening'', p. 14</ref>

:{{Blockquote|Endearing and likeable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things without thinking.

Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends.
