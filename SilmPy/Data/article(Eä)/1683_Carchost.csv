'''Carchost''' was the eastern<ref name=UI/> of the two towers that flanked the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]] (otherwise know as the [[Morannon]]).  Together, Carchost and its counterpart [[Narchost]] were known as the [[Towers of the Teeth]]<ref name="Towers">{{RK|VI1}}</ref> or even the [[Teeth of Mordor]].<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref>  They were originally made by the men of [[Gondor]] but in the later Third Age they had been long abandoned by the Gondorians and were overrun with evil. [[Sauron]] used them as watch towers to guard [[Mordor]], protecting it from the very nation which had originally built them.<ref name="Towers"/>
