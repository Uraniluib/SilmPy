'''Kelvar''' was a name used by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Yavanna]] to refer to that part of her natural realm capable of moving or escaping, as opposed to the [[olvar]] which were rooted in place. The terms kelvar and olvar, then, refer respectively to animal and plant life, and are essentially equivalent in meaning to fauna and flora.<ref name=S2>{{S|2}}</ref>

After the awakening of the [[Elves]], some of the kelvar were said to have been inhabited by powerful spirits. Most famous among these were the great [[Eagles]] that overlooked events in [[Middle-earth]] from their mountainous eyries.<ref name=S2/>

==Etymology==

''Kelvar'' is an [[Elvish]] word meaning "animals, living things that move",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> probably derived from the stem [[KEL|KEL-]], meaning "go" or "run".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 363</ref> It has been suggested that ''kelvar'' is a [[Quenya]] word, and that the (unattested) singular form would likely be ''kelva''.<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist]" (accessed 15 March 2011)</ref>

Other words for "animal" (names which in general only referred to "four-footed beasts, and never to reptiles or birds") were [[Quenya]] ''laman'' (pl. ''lamni'' or ''lamani''), and [[Sindarin]] ''lavan'' (pl. ''levain'').<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, p. 416 (note 33)</ref>

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "living creature, animal" is ''cuid''. The word ''meg'' is glossed as "any small animal, especially mole".<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 27, 56</ref>
