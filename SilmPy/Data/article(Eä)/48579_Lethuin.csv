'''Lethuin''' is a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[Woodland Realm]] in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' films]], portrayed by Eli Kent.

===History===
Lethuin helped capture [[Thorin and Company]] while they were in [[Mirkwood]], and was later seen in the cellar conversing with [[Galion]] while [[Bilbo Baggins]] was searching for a means of helping the Dwarves escape.

===Etymology===
''Lethuin'' is obviously an anagram of the [[canon]]ical name [[LÃºthien]] (the same way certain other background characters were given names of that nature throughout the [[Peter Jackson]] films). However, there is no actual background or etymology behind it.
