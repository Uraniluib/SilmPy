'''Vaiya''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈvaɪja]}}), or '''Vaia''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈvaɪ.a]}}) or '''Waia''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈwaɪ.a]}}) is the dark sea that surrounds the world of [[Arda]] before the cataclysm at the end of the [[Second Age]]. Vaiya is globed within the [[Ilurambar]], the [[Walls of the World]], and outside them is the [[Void]].<ref>{{SM|A1}}</ref>

Vaiya flows completely around the world, forming a sea below it and a form of air above it. The waters of the Inner Seas are actually a compound of the substances of Vaiya, [[Ilmen]] and [[Ambar]]. The world is described as floating on Vaiya, like a ship on a sea. [[Ulmo]] the Lord of Waters dwells in Vaiya, below the roots of Ambar, the [[Martalmar]].<ref name=fashion/>

Vaiya is narrow at the West and East of the world, and deepest in the North and South. Vaiya is described as extremely cold: where the interior seas fell down the [[Chasm of Ilmen]], their waterfalls made bridges of ice which close the chasm. The ice extended to all Vaiya and even the Ilurambar.<ref name=fashion>{{SM|5b}}</ref> The [[Sun]] passes through Vaiya on its way around the world, warming it as it passes. 

It cannot support any ships except the boats of Ulmo: the ships of the [[Númenóreans]] that tried to sail on it sank, drowning the sailors.

After Arda was [[Changing of the World|made round]], Vaiya became the upper atmosphere of the spherical world.<ref>{{SM|A3}}</ref>

The next layer of "air", inside Vaiya, is [[Ilmen]], and the last layer, closest to the surface, is [[Vista]].<ref name=fashion/> 
==Etymology==
''Vaiya'' or ''vaia'' (from earlier ''waiya'', ''waia'') means "fold, envelope".<ref name=3n/> It derives from the [[root]] [[WAY]]- 'enfold'.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 397.</ref>

In the earlier ''[[Book of Lost Tales]]'', the early [[Qenya]] forms Vai and Vatya are derived from the [[root]] ''vaya-'' "enfold".<ref name=3n/> From that root are derived the [[Gnomish]] forms Bai and Baithon "the outer airs".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

Before the writing of the [[Lord of the Rings]], Waiya > Vaiya was the name of the [[Tengwa]] that would appear as [[Vala (tengwa)|Vala]] in [[Appendix E]].<ref>{{VT|46}} p.32</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the early schematic titled ''[[I Vene Kemen]]'', the highest layer of airs was marked as ''Vaitya'' ([[Qenya]]) which "wrapped around the world and without it". The earliest versions also mention Vai as the Outer Ocean with so thin waters that is unsailable except for the fishes and the car of Ulmo.<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref> Christopher Tolkien suggested that Vaiya of the ''Ambarkanta'' is a concept combined from both Vai and Vatya.<ref name=3n>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref>

Vaiya is mentioned for the last time in [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]] but without its property as an outer layer of air above and below the World. In that text, Vaiya was renamed [[Ekkaia]], which is retained in the published [[Silmarillion]].<ref>{{MR|P3I2}}</ref> There it is described more vaguely, and only as a wide Sea around Arda, inside the [[Walls of Night]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that in the [[Ambarkanta]], as well as an earlier unfinished version of the Silmarillion (c. 1937), there is the Chasm of Ilmen ''between'' the Earth and Vaiya, into which [[Tilion]] guides the Moon. However for the published [[Silmarillion]], he preferred a later passage (c. 1951) where [[Tilion]] plunges into a Chasm which is ''beyond'' the Outer Sea<ref>{{S|11}}</ref> thus describing a different Outer Sea than that of the Ambarkanta.<ref>{{SM|5e}}</ref>
