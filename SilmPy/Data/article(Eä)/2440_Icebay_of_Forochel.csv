The '''Icebay of Forochel''' was an immense body of water whose southern reach lay between the northern tips of the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Misty Mountains]] and extended for hundreds of miles to the northeast.  The mouth of the bay was in the southwest, between the Blue Mountains and the Cape of [[Forochel]], which separated most of the bay from the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref name="UTmap">{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[Elder Days]] some [[Men]] settled in the far north, a people known as the [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]], who endured the bitter cold of the realm of [[Morgoth]].  In the [[Third Age]] a remnant of these people were known as the [[Lossoth]] or the Snowmen of Forochel.  Most of the Lossoth lived on the Cape of Forochel but there were some who camped along its southern shores.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

In {{TA|1974}} the kingdom of [[Arthedain]] was overrun by the forces of [[Angmar]].  King [[Arvedui]] fled to the north, first to the far end of the Blue Mountains and then, driven by hunger, to the camps of the Lossoth.  Partly from fear and partly from pity these people fed and sheltered the king and his men.  Then, in March of {{TA|1975|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> a ship from [[Círdan]] reached the Icebay to take Arvedui and his party onboard.  After they set sail though a storm arose which crushed the ship in the ice and the king, his men, and all the mariners perished in the sea.<ref name="Eriador"/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the words "Ice Bay of Forochel" were placed either adjacent to or in the smaller southern lobe of the bay.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> However, in the ''[[Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] added an arrow after the label that pointed to the larger northeast part of the bay.<ref name="UTmap"/>  Christopher stated that his original map was marked incorrectly and that he had little doubt that the upper extension was part of the full bay.<ref>{{UT|Introduction}}, ''The Map of Middle-earth''</ref>  The full extent of the Icebay is shown on Map IA in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]''.<ref>{{TI|MI}}, p. 303</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Icebay was the smaller body of water, the larger bay was not featured in the game. It contained many small islands and icebergs, including Sâri-surma, lair of the Gaunt-lord Drugoth the Death-monger. The wreckage of [[Arvedui]]'s ship was located in some ice off the coast of the north-western shore. It was haunted by the shade of the king, who had cursed himself in his final moments.
