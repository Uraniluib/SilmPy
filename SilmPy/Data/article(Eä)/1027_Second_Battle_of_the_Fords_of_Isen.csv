[[Erkenbrand]]'s [[Rohirrim]], commanded by [[Grimbold]] and [[Elfhelm]], fought [[Saruman]]'s forces at the Fords of Isen. However, being severely outnumbered, the [[Rohirrim]] were forced to pull back, and the shield wall they had made was broken in the process. [[Saruman]] was victorious, and the Riders of Rohan scattered and retreated. The Rider [[Ceorl]] was sent to report to [[Ã‰omer]] about the defeat.
