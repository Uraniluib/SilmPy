'''Lindir''' was an Elf of [[Rivendell]]. 
__NOTOC__
== History ==
After [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s rendition of his ''[[Song of EÃ¤rendil]]'', Lindir claimed that he was unable to tell which parts were written by [[Aragorn]], and which by Bilbo himself, explaining that he knew little of [[Mortals]] and their ways.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Lindir'' seems to be composed of ''[[lin]]'' ("tune") + ''ndir'' ("man"), therefore meaning "song man".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.realelvish.net/book_names.php|articlename=What do all those Names in the Books Mean?|website=[http://www.realelvish.net/ Merin Essi ar Quenteli!]}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Lindir is portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]]. He welcomes Gandalf and the party of Dwarves to Rivendell in place of Elrond, who is hunting, and later reports to Lord Elrond that [[Thorin]] and his companions have departed in secret. <ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> McKenzie also appeared in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] as an extra dubbed "[[Figwit]]" by fans. It is unclear whether that character is intended to be Lindir.
