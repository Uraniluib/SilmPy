'''Nimloth''' (died {{FA|506}}) was an elf-maid of [[Doriath]], the daughter of [[Galathil]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

== History ==

In {{FA|497}} she wedded [[Dior]], King [[Thingol]]'s heir, and for a time lived with him by the [[Lanthir Lamath]] waterfall at the base of the [[Blue Mountains]]. There she gave birth to [[Elwing]], [[Eluréd]], and [[Elurín]]. In 504, after the murder of King Thingol, she returned to Doriath with her husband and became Queen of Doriath. Their reign was short-lived, however, as the [[Sons of Fëanor]] assaulted [[Menegroth]] and slew both her and Dior. This was the [[Second Kinslaying]]. Her youngest children, Eluréd and Elurín, were left in the forest to die by the servants of [[Celegorm]]. Elwing, however, escaped to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]]. Years later she would wed [[Eärendil]] and together they would gain aid from [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
