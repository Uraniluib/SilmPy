}}'''Rómendacil I''' ({{TA|310}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|541|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 231 years) was born '''Tarostar''', the son of [[Ostoher]], [[King of Gondor]]. He in turn would become the eighth King of Gondor, ruling for 49 years, from Third Age 492 until his untimely death.

==History==

In {{TA|490}} the first invasion of [[Easterlings]] fell upon [[Gondor]].  Due to his father's age, Tarostar led the forces that would drive the invaders out.  After his victory in {{TA|500}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> (eight years after he had succeeded his father) Tarostar assumed the name Rómendacil, "East-victor".<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

After the first assault of the Easterlings, Rómendacil ordered that the "Tradition of Isildur" be set down in a sealed scroll, to be delivered by the [[Steward of Gondor]] to the King's heir before his crowning.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

Rómendacil's triumph did not end the Easterling threat.  New hordes assailed [[Gondor]] and in {{TA|541}} Rómendacil died in renewed battle.<ref name="TA"/>  His son [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar]] would avenge his death.<ref name="Gondor"/>
