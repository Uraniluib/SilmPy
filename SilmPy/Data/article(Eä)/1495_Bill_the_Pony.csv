"'''Bill'''" was [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s pony, named for its original owner [[Bill Ferny]].

==History==
Bill (who probably had not even a name then) was owned by [[Bill Ferny]] in [[Bree]], mistreated and half-starved. He was the only animal in town, since Bill or his allies had opened the stables of ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' and all the mounts went loose.

The next day Bill sold the pony to [[Frodo Baggins]] for twelve [[silver pennies]] (more than three times his worth).<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> This proved the best thing for Bill, as [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam Gamgee]] dearly loved him and fed him back to health.

Bill the Pony travelled with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] and the [[Hobbits]] through the leagues of [[Eriador]],<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref> at one point carrying Frodo on their way  to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> Then he accompanied the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], carrying their rations. Outside the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], for fear of his safety, Bill was released into the wild, encouraged to make his way back to [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

On the homeward journey of the hobbits, Sam, who was fond of the pony, was reunited with Bill at the ''Prancing Pony''.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>  When the returning hobbits came to the gate upon the bridge across the [[Brandywine]] and Bill Ferny threw the keys at [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], it was Bill the pony who kicked Bill Ferny as he ran off into the night.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>  

Finally, Sam rode Bill when he accompanied [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on his trip to the [[Grey Havens]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
