The '''Fords of Isen''' were the crossing point of the [[North-South Road]] on the river [[Isen]] in the [[Gap of Rohan]].   At the western border of the realm of [[Rohan]] and at a strategic position between the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[White Mountains]],<ref name="Map">{{UT|Map}}</ref> the Ford was the main entrance to Rohan from the west, and constantly guarded by the [[Rohirrim]].

==Geography==
The River Isen ([[Sindarin]] '''[[Sîr Angren]]''') could not be crossed anywhere south of [[Isengard]], except at the Fords of Isen,<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> which were just above the point where the river bent west towards [[Belegaer]].<ref name="Map"/>  In this area the river became broad and shallow, flowing across a stony shelf and branching into two arms about a large eyot.  Only here could large forces effectively cross the river.<ref name="Isen"/>  During much of the time the Fords were closely guarded from the fortresses of [[Isengard]] and the [[Hornburg]] at [[Helm's Deep]].

==History==
In {{SA|3320}}, two Númenórean Kingdoms were established - [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>  Between them ran a road built by the [[Exiles of Númenor|Númenórean Exiles]] to connect their realms.  A traveler journeying southward through [[Enedwaith]] along the [[North-South Road]] would come to the point where it crossed the River [[Isen]] (then known by its [[Elvish]] name of '[[Angren]]'). The crossing of the Fords of Isen—the [[Ethraid Engrin]] (or ''Athrad Angren'') as they were known in those times—marked the point of entry into the southern land of Gondor.

After the fall of [[Sauron]] in {{SA|3441}}<ref name="SA"/> but before [[Isildur]] departed from [[Gondor]] in {{TA|2}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the army of Arnor marched home to [[Eriador]] via the Fords of Isen.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

In {{TA|2510}} the Steward [[Cirion]] granted the land of [[Calenardhon]] to [[Eorl]] the Young.<ref name="TA"/>  The River Isen then became the western boundary of the new realm of [[Rohan]] and responsibility for the great road and the Fords fell upon the [[Rohirrim]], although it was agreed that free passageway would be maintained for all travelers of either people.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) ''Cirion and Eorl''</ref>

In {{TA|2758}} a force of [[Dunlendings]] led by [[Wulf]] invaded Rohan through the Crossings of Isen. King [[Helm]] attempted to fight them off at that point but was defeated and retreated to [[Hornburg|Suthburg]] while Rohan was overran.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

On [[18 September]], {{TA|3018}}, the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] crossed the Fords of Isen on their way to [[the Shire]].<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>

In the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] (on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="Great"/>) the [[Orcs]] of [[Saruman]], reinforced by [[Dunlendings]] and wolfriders, plus two battalions of [[Uruk-hai]], rushed down upon [[Théodred]], King [[Théoden]]'s son, and killed the Prince.  This blow against the leadership of Rohan was Saruman's main objective in this battle and his forces then withdrew.

[[Erkenbrand]] of [[Westfold]] maintained a defense at the Fords after the First Battle, under the immediate command of [[Grimbold]], strengthened by [[Elfhelm]] and his riders.  However, on [[2 March]], {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="Great"/> the host of Saruman overwhelmed the defenders and swept across the Fords in the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]].

In August of {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> [[Aragorn]] took leave of the reduced company that had formed King Théoden's funeral escort near the Fords of Isen.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name for the Fords of Isen was ''Ethraid Engrin'' (singular ''Athrad Angren'').<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 47</ref>

The literal meaning of ''Ethraid Engrin'' is "fords of iron" (''[[athrad|ethraid]]'' + ''[[angren|engrin]]'').{{fact}}
