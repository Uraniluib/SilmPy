The '''Gondolindrim''' were the people of [[Gondolin]], a mixed population of [[Noldor|Noldorin]] and [[Sindar|Sindarin]] Elves under the rule of [[Turgon]].<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref><ref name="Tuor">{{UT|1}}</ref> While they take their name from the city of Gondolin where they later dwelt, the Gondolindrim were in origin the Elves of [[Nevrast]].<ref name="Noldor">{{S|Noldor}}</ref> [[Ulmo]] seemed to take a special interest in the Gondolindrim throughout their history. The Gondolindrim were keen in arts and constructions but also valiant fighters.

==History==
The first Elves to dwell in Nevrast were Sindar, who had been drawn in days of old to the coasts near [[Mount Taras]] by the comings of Ulmo and [[Ossë]]. At the time the Noldor returned to [[Middle-earth]], most of the Grey-elves of Nevrast still dwelt in the coastal region in the southwest. Turgon settled there with his own people, Noldor of the house of [[Fingolfin]], taking up lordship of Nevrast and building [[Vinyamar]]. The first mingling of Sindar and Noldor took place in Nevrast, and they became one people.<ref name=Beleriand/>

At Ulmo's urging and with his guidance Turgon, seeking a refuge from [[Morgoth]], found the hidden vale of [[Tumladen]] within the [[Encircling Mountains]]. After [[Dagor Aglareb]] Turgon brought many of the most skilled of the Elves of Nevrast to Tumladen, where they set about building Gondolin in secret. When the city was finished, the people of Nevrast (including one third of the Noldor of Fingolfin, and even more Sindar) abandoned Nevrast and came in secret, in small companies one-by-one, through [[Ered Wethrin]] to Gondolin.<ref name=Noldor/>

Because Gondolin was strictly separated from the rest of Beleriand by [[Ered Wethrin]] and it is unlikely that substantial numbers of other kindreds ever came to settle there. Only a few notable outsiders are known to have reached the hidden city: [[Huor]] and [[Húrin Thalion]] were the first [[Men]] to come to Gondolin and dwelt there for a year,<ref>{{S|18}}.</ref> [[Tuor]], son of Huor, made the city his home<ref name="S23">{{S|23}}</ref><ref name=Tuor/> and [[Maeglin]], son of [[Eöl|Eöl the Dark Elf]] and Turgon's sister [[Aredhel]], fled there with his mother from [[Nan Elmoth]].<ref name="S16">{{S|16}}.</ref>

At the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the survivors led by Tuor went to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].

==Etymology==
''Gondolindrim'' is a standard formation of ''Gondolin'' ([[Sindarin|S]]: 'The Hidden Rock') and the Sindarin suffix ''[[rim|-rim]]'', denoting a people.<ref name="SApp">{{S|Appendix}}.</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
'''Gondothlim''' was an earlier term for the inhabitants of Gondolin.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>

==Houses of the Gondolindrim==
In the ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' the Gondolindrim are described as being organised into a number of Houses. At the time of the city's fall there were twelve of these, each with a named symbol and leader:
