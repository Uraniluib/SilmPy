The '''Forgoil''', or the '''Strawheads''' as it reportedly translated in [[Westron]], were the enemies of the [[Dunlendings]]. In the rest of Middle-earth, they were known as [[Rohirrim]]. 
==Etymology==
''Forgoil'' is the only known word in the language of the Dunlendings. It is possible that the final part of the word, ''-il'', is a plural marker, such as in the case of [[Westron]] ''il'' cf. ''[[mûmakil]]'' (which is perhaps [[Haradric]]); similar formation with the ending ''-li'' is also seen in [[Quenya]].<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/mannish.htm Various Mannish Tongues]", [[Ardalambion]]</ref> There is also a possibility of a plural formation with infixion from *''forgol''

The (possible) element ''go'' has been tied to the [[Pre-Númenórean]] word ''[[Go-hilleg]]'',<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', "[[Tal-Elmar (chapter)|Tal-Elmar]]"</ref> which is untranslated, but refers to the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean settlers]]. It could mean "head", in this sense.<ref>[[Roman Rausch]], "[http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/Drughu.htm Tar-Elmar and the Drughu tongue]", [http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/ Sindanórië]</ref> However, both these interpretations remain speculation; [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never left any notes on the subject.
