The '''Battle of the Gwathló''' was one of the battles fought during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]].  It ended in a serious defeat for the Dark Lord.

==Prologue==
In {{SA|1695}} [[Gil-galad]], the Elven King of [[Lindon]], requested aid from [[Númenor]] when [[Sauron]] invaded [[Eriador]].  The [[Númenóreans]] sent a fleet commanded by the admiral [[Ciryatur]], but it was delayed until {{SA|1700|n}}, by which time the beleaguered [[Elves]] were barely holding the line of the River [[Lhûn]].  The arrival of the Númenóreans immediately changed the balance of forces such that Sauron's host was driven back with heavy casualties.  Sauron suffered further defeat at [[Sarn Ford]] (on the [[Baranduin]]) and retreated to [[Tharbad]] where more of his forces joined him after coming up from the south-east.<ref name="Galad">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

==The Battle==
Unbeknownst to Sauron, Admiral Ciryatur had more forces at his disposal and had landed a strong force at the [[Lond Daer|small Númenórean harbour]] at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]] River.  This new contingent fell upon Sauron's rear from the south-west while Gil-galad's Elves and the other Númenóreans attacked from the north.  Sauron's army was completely routed and he barely escaped himself.<ref name="Galad"/>

==Aftermath==
Sauron and his small remaining forces fled across the [[Isen]] but were caught in eastern [[Calenardhon]].  Only a small bodyguard was left when Sauron escaped to [[Dagorlad]].  [[Eriador]] had peace for many years but the humiliation inflicted on Sauron determined him to seek vengeance upon Númenor.<ref name="Galad"/>
