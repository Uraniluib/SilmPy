The '''Mearas''' was the name given by the [[Rohirrim]] in [[Rohirric|their language]] for a race of exceptional [[horses]].<ref name="Riders">{{TT|III2}}</ref> 
==Description==
The Mearas were strong, wild, and intelligent.  They would bear no man but the kings or princes of the Mark (with [[Gandalf]] as a notable exception).  Their lifespan was as long as men<ref group="note">The average lifespan of those [[Kings of Rohan]] who did not die young was 82.4 years; thus the Mearas lived for eight decades.</ref> and, according to tradition, the ancestors of the Mearas were brought from the [[Uttermost West|West]] by [[Béma]].<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

[[Felaróf]] and [[Snowmane]] were white, whereas [[Shadowfax]] was grey.

==History==
In {{TA|2501}}<ref group="note">Eorl was 16 when his father died. Since Eorl was born in {{TA|2485|n}} Léod died in 2501.</ref> [[Léod]] of the [[Éothéod]] captured and tried to tame the first of the Mearas, only to be killed when he tried to mount it.  His son, [[Eorl]], however managed to ride it and named it [[Felaróf]]. Eorl came with this horse south to [[Rohan]] and the Mearas were his descendants.  Felaróf was said to be able to understand men's speech.<ref name="Eorl"/>
 
In {{TA|3018|n}},<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> the greatest of the Mearas, [[Shadowfax]], consented to be ridden by [[Gandalf]].<ref name="Riders"/>  Gandalf rode Shadowfax throughout the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The word Mearas comes from [[Old English]] ''mēaras'', simply meaning "horses". Its singular form would be ''[[Wiktionary:mearh#Old_English|mearh]]'' or ''marh''. [[Robert Foster]] in his ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' incorrectly displays the singular as ''Meara''.
 
The root ''marh'' can be seen in the names of the [[Northmen]] ''[[Marhwini]]'' and ''[[Marhari]]'' (which are actually [[Gothic]])<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 6</ref> as well as ''[[Marcho]]''.
