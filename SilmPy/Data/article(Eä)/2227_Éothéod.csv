The '''Éothéod'''  were a race of [[Northmen]] who flourished near the [[Vales of Anduin]] and later in northern [[Mirkwood]] from around {{TA|1856}} to {{TA|2510|n}}. They were faithful allies to [[Gondor]], and eventually were the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]].
==History==
After the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}) much of the Kingdom of [[Rhovanion]] was lost to the [[Wainriders]], and its people were enslaved. The northern Lord [[Marhwini]] with some remnants of Northmen went to the [[Vales of Anduin]] to the west. They were soon joined by many fugitives from [[Mirkwood]] whose lands were taken by the Wainriders. They established themselves between the eastern bank of the River Anduin and the western edge of Mirkwood Forest.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|8}}</ref> 

These migrations happened outside the knowledge of [[Gondor]], who learned about their existence many years later. That was until around {{TA|1899|n}} when Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] that the Wainriders were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]]. But the enslaved Northmen also prepared a revolt against the Wainriders. Calimehtar therefore provoked the Wainriders out of [[Ithilien]], and his horsemen, joined by a large [[éored]] led by Marhwini, drove the Wainriders back. Meanwhile outlaws and roused slaves from Mirkwood burned many Wainriders settlements. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref name="Cirion"/>

In the time of [[Forthwini]], the Éothéod were troubled again by raids into the south of his land, both up the river and through the [[Narrows]] of Mirkwood. The [[Lord of the Éothéod]] then warned King [[Ondoher]] that the Wainriders were recovering. The attack finally came around {{TA|1944|n}} and men of the Éothéod fought with Ondoher. [[Faramir son of Ondoher]] refused to remain in [[Minas Tirith]] and joined a battalion of Éothéod but was caught with a party of them as they retreated towards the [[Dead Marshes]]. The [[leader of the Éothéod]] did not manage to save him and Faramir died in his arms, before he found out that he was the Prince. He then went to join [[Minohtar]] at the head of the [[North Road]] in Ithilien. Eventually the Wainriders were defeated by [[Earnil II]] at the [[Battle of the Camp]].<ref name="Cirion"/>

The Éothéod were now well-known to Gondor as a people of good trust. Having established contact, the historians of Gondor compiled their knowledge about all that had passed in the far northern region. 

===Migration===
[[File:Douglas Chaffee - Framsburg.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas Chaffee - ''[[Framsburg]]''.]]
After the fall of [[Angmar]] ({{TA|1975|n}}) Lord [[Frumgar]] led the Éothéod to a new land north of Mirkwood, between the Misty Mountains and the [[Forest River]] away from the ravages of the [[Easterlings]] and [[Orcs]]. Southward it extended to the confluence of [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]] sources of the Great River [[Anduin]], near where the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]] met the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Cirion"/>  They founded their capital there.  
Some time later their king [[Fram]], son of Frumgar, slew the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Scatha]]. The Éothéod capital was named ''[[Framsburg]]'' in his honour. After Fram nothing is known of the leaders of Éothéod until much later time, when king [[Léod]] was killed trying to tame the [[Horses|horse]] [[Felaróf]], first of the ''[[Mearas]]'' of Rohan. His son and successor [[Eorl the Young]] tamed the horse, taking it into service as compensation for his father's life.
During the rule of the ruling [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] [[Cirion]] had always in his mind the menace from the North. It was thus not until the winter of {{TA|2509}} was past that he became aware that a great movement against Gondor was being prepared. Gondor faced an attack by the evil ''[[Balchoth]]'', and Cirion sent messengers to the Éothéod capital. King Eorl answered the call for help, and rode out with most of the Éothéod to help their allies of old, leaving only a few warriors behind to protect his people. The Riders arrived just in time to help the army of Gondor at the [[Field of Celebrant]], and after [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|defeating]] the enemy Cirion asked the Éothéod to watch over the depopulated province of [[Calenardhon]].

===The Rohirrim===
Three months later Cirion gave Calenardhon as a gift to Eorl and his people, and Eorl swore his [[Oath of Eorl|Oath]] of eternal friendship. Messengers were sent north, and the Éothéod completely removed to the plains of Calenardhon.

The Éothéod renamed themselves ''Eorlingas'' or "followers of Eorl", but in the [[Gondor Sindarin|language of Gondor]] they became known as the [[Rohirrim]], or ''Horse-lords'', and their country became known as [[Rohan]], the Riddermark.

==Etymology==
The name Éothéod is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning "horse people". It renders the original [[Rohirric]] word '''[[Lohtûr]]'''; "loho-" or "lô-" correspond to the Anglo-Saxon "éo-", meaning "horse".<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 53.</ref>
