'''Nísinen''' was the long thin lake that formed along the lower course of the River [[Nunduinë]], above the haven of [[Eldalondë]] on [[Númenor]]'s western coast.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> Along its banks grew all manner of sweet-smelling plants, and so it got its name - Nísinen comes from the [[Elvish]] for 'fragrant water'.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
