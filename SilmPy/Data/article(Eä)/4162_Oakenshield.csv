'''Oakenshield''' was the title and sobriquet of King [[Thorin|Thorin II]] of [[Durin's Folk]].

Thorin acquired the title long before he became King. In {{TA|2799}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> when he was just fifty-three (a young age for a Dwarf) he marched with a mighty Dwarf-army to the valley they called [[Azanulbizar]], [[Nanduhirion]] beneath the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria]]. There they fought the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|Battle of Nanduhirion]], the last and greatest in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. In that battle, Thorin's shield was broken, so he cut a bough from an oak-tree with his axe, and used that instead to fend off his enemies' blows, or to club them. It was that oaken branch that gave Thorin his surname, but it did not completely save him from injury - it is recorded that he was wounded in the battle.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>  In memory of the battle, Thorin bore a plain shield of oak wood with no device, and swore to do so until he was hailed king.<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref>

 
==Inspiration==
Like many [[Dwarvish]] names, it appears in the [[Norse]] poem Völuspá in the form Eikinskjaldi, but there it is the personal name of a Dwarf, not a surname as in Tolkien's work.<ref>{{HH|A3}}</ref>

[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that Tolkien may possibly have been inspired by a [[Wikipedia:Kvæði|Faroese ballad]], "[[Wikipedia:Regin|Regin]] Smiður", in which [[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] uses an oak tree branch as a weapon:<ref>{{webcite|author=Various|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?33053-Influence-of-the-Sigurd-legend-on-parts-of-The-Hobbit|articlename=Influence of the Sigurd legend on parts of ''The Hobbit''?|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=14 March 2013}}</ref>
