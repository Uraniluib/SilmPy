'''Vingilótë''' was the ship in which [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] sailed to [[Aman]] to seek pardon and assistance from the [[Valar]].  This vessel was said to be the fairest ever fashioned – it had white timbers of [[Birches|birchwood]] from [[Nimbrethil]], oars of gold, sails of silver,<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> and its prow was swan-shaped.<ref name="Meetings"/> 
 
==History==
After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] and the [[Fall of the Falas]], the remnant of the [[Noldor]] and [[Men]] gathered about the [[Havens of Sirion]] where Eärendil was their lord.  Eärendil sought to sail into the West to seek [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]] and to ask for pardon from the [[Valar]] for his people.  For these purposes Vingilótë was built by Eärendil and [[Círdan|Círdan the Shipwright]].<ref group="note">The date of Vingilótë's construction is not known.  Tuor and Idril departed in {{FA|525}} and Eärendil began his voyages in {{FA|534|n}} so the ship must have been built sometime within those years.</ref>
 
Eärendil sailed in Vingilótë while his wife Elwing waited by the mouths of [[Sirion]].  Although he had many adventures he could not make his way to the shores of [[Valinor]]. Finally, having fearful dreams concerning Elwing, he hastened back to [[Middle-earth]].  It was well that he hurried, for the sons of [[Fëanor]], having learned that Elwing possessed a [[Silmaril]], made a sudden attack upon the exiles and refugees of [[Gondolin]] and [[Doriath]].  Though [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]] won the battle they did not gain the Silmaril; Elwing cast herself into the sea with the jewel upon her breast.
 
[[Ulmo]] lifted Elwing from the [[Belegaer|sea]] and transformed her into a great white bird.  In this guise she flew to Vingilótë and fell into a swoon, but in the morning regained her normal form.  Eärendil and Elwing, with the mariners [[Falathar]], [[Erellont]], and [[Aerandir]], turned westward and again sought Valinor.  On this voyage Eärendil stood in the prow of Vingilótë with the Silmaril bound to his brow.  The jewel shone ever brighter as they traveled west and by its light and power they pierced the [[Shadowy Seas]].
 
The fruits of their voyage were to change the world: The Valar received Eärendil's plea, the [[War of Wrath]] was fought, and [[Beleriand]] sank beneath the waves.  To Eärendil and Elwing and their sons were given their choice of kindred.  The three sailing companions of Eärendil and Elwing were put into a different boat and driven east by a great wind.  Lastly, Vingilótë was hallowed, made fair and marvelous,<ref group="note">In [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] poem about Eärendil he claimed that Vingilótë was remade "''of [[mithril]] and of elven-glass''". This was probably for poetic effect.</ref> and lifted into the sky.  There Eärendil eternally sails the vessel with the Silmaril still upon his brow and he and his ship are called [[Gil-Estel]], the Star of High Hope, and [[Star of Eärendil]].
 
However Vingilótë was used for one last task for the Valar, Elves, and Men.  In the [[War of Wrath]], as his forces failed, [[Morgoth]] released the winged [[dragons]].  Led by [[Ancalagon]] the Black, the dragons began pushing back the host of the Valar. Then came Eärendil in Vingilótë with a host of great birds and they gave battle to the dragons.  Finally Eärendil slew Ancalagon and the host of the Valar prevailed.<ref name="Earendil"/>
 
==Etymology==
Vingilótë means "Foam-flower" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[winga]]'' = "foam, spray"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''wing''</ref> and ''[[lótë]]'' = "flower"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''loth''</ref>).  ''Vingilot'' (or ''Vingelot'') is the [[Sindarin]] version of its name and ''[[Rothinzil]]'' is its name in [[Adûnaic]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
