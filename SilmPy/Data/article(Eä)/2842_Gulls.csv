'''Gulls''' or '''mews''' were birds found on all shores in [[Arda]].
==History==
Gulls were common in all sea-bordering lands (perhaps especially abundant on the cape of [[Ras Mewrim|Bar-in-Mŷl]], the "Home of the Gulls", in the land of the [[Falas]]<ref name="QaE"/>), and for that, they were often attributed to [[Ossë]].<ref name="Fall">{{LT2|III}}</ref> The [[Teleri]] that dwelt in the [[Havens]] were very fond of them, and their mewing welcomed [[Tuor]] to their land.<ref>{{UT|1}}</ref> They were also known in [[Númenor]]<ref name="AaE">{{UT|4}}</ref> and [[Gondor]].<ref name="tLD">{{RK|V9}}</ref>

Their association with the sea caused a great sense of longing for the journey to [[Valinor]] among [[Elves]] that were not familiar with their sound. One of those was [[Legolas]].<ref name="tLD"/>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
The [[House of the Wing]] wore [[swans|swan]] or gull-like feathers on their helmets.<ref name="Fall"/> The [[Lindar]] were at one point considered the "Lords of the Gulls" among many other names.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 215</ref>

==Etymology==
In the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', one [[Noldorin]] and one [[Quenya]] word for "gull" appear, both from the same root: ''[[maew]]'' and ''[[maiwë]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} ([[Sundocarme|Root]] [[MIW]])</ref> A later recorded [[Sindarin]] word is ''[[mŷl]]'',<ref name="QaE">{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 379, 418 (note 8)</ref> which replaced ''[[gwael]]''.<ref name="QaE"/>

In manuscripts related to the ''Etymologies'' Tolkien also experimented with the Noldorin form ''cuen'', glossed as "small gull, petrel".<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 24</ref>

==Other fiction==
In the story ''[[Roverandom]]'', a seagull named Mew brings the dog Rover to the moon. On their way, Mew stops to visit other sea-birds, among them the "''oldest and most important of all the Blackbacked Gulls''".<ref>{{HM|R}}, "[Chapter] 2"</ref>
