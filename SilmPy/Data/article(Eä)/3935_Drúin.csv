'''''Drúin''''' is a [[Sindarin]] word referring to the wild, reclusive [[Men]] known as the [[Drúedain]]. The name comes ultimately from their own name for themselves, [[Drúedain|Drughu]], adapted to the sounds of Sindarin [[Elvish]]. Drúin is a simple plural (directly equivalent to "Woses"), but there were also other forms in Sindarin. [[Drúedain|Drúath]] would refer to a large number or crowd of these people, while [[Drúedain]] was a reference to the race as a whole.
