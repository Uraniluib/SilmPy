'''Tyeller''' (singular '''tyellë''') is the [[Quenya]] word for "grade, order; a step in a stairway, ladder".<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 122, 157</ref>

In the [[Tengwar]] system of writing, the Tyeller were the six "grades" used to indicate modifications to a basic sound in Tengwar and represented six modes of articulation in the mouth. 

The Tyeller were signified by the length of the [[telco]] and the number of the [[lúva]]r (one or two). Some specialized Tengwar modes had eight tyeller instead of six, containing an
extended telco both above and below the line.

For example, where the first tyellë referred to the basic [[patakar]], the tengwar known as [[Tinco]], [[Parma]], [[Calma]] and [[Quesse]], the following tyeller would typically represent modifications of their basic sounds. 

Specifically, in the sequence known as [[tincotéma]], the next tyeller would normally represent the dental sounds like ''nd'', ''d'', ''th'', ''dh'' etc, according to the system.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''tyelle'' obviously derives from [[PQ]] *''kjellê'', from the [[Sundocarmë|Root]] KJEL.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 157</ref>

It is also one of the few words ending in -''e'' which forms the plural in -''r'', instead of -''i'', hence ''tyeller'' instead of **''tyelli''.
