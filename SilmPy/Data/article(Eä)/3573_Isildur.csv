'''Isildur''' was a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] of [[Númenor]], the elder son of [[Elendil]], [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the [[Realms in Exile]]. He was briefly the second king of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].

== History ==
===Early Years in Númenor===
Isildur was born in Númenor in {{SA|3209}}.  He was the elder son of Elendil, son of [[Amandil]], the last [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].  His younger brother was [[Anárion]].  While living in the island realm he married and his first son, [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]] was born in {{SA|3299|n}}.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

Isildur learned from Amandil that King [[Ar-Pharazôn]], under the influence of [[Sauron]], purposed to cut down [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]].  One night Isildur went in disguise to [[Armenelos]] and from the courts of the King stole a fruit from the tree before it was cut down, thus preserving the line of the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]].  It is said that he received grievous wounds from the King's guards before escaping but that they all healed when a leaf first appeared on the sapling that grew from the fruit he had taken.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

When Ar-Pharazôn ordered the [[Great Armament]] to assail the land of [[Aman]], Elendil and his sons prepared ships to escape from Númenor.  In the ship of Isildur was guarded the young White Tree.<ref name="Akallabeth"/>  When the [[Downfall of Númenor]] came in {{SA|3319|n}}<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> Elendil and his son escaped in nine ships – four for Elendil, three for Isildur, and two for Anárion.<ref name="Akallabeth"/>

===Joint Rule of Gondor===
In the great storm that came with the drowning of Númenor the nine ships of the Exiles were borne to the east and scattered.  Elendil was cast up in the land of [[Lindon]], passed up the River [[Lhûn]], and founded the realm of [[Arnor]].  Isildur and Anárion were carried to the south.  Arriving at the mouths of the [[Anduin]], they ascended the great river and founded the realm of [[Gondor]].<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

Isildur set up his house in [[Minas Ithil]], where he planted the White Tree, while Anárion established his household in [[Minas Anor]].  However, they jointly ruled the kingdom and set up thrones side by side in the Great Hall of [[Osgiliath]].<ref name="Rings"/>  Isildur and his wife had two more sons, [[Aratan]] (in {{SA|3339|n}}) and [[Ciryon]] (in {{SA|3379|n}}), while living in Gondor.<ref name="Elendil"/>

However, [[Sauron]] had also escaped the Downfall of Númenor.  In {{SA|3320}}, while the Exiles were establishing their realms, Sauron reentered [[Mordor]] and re-established his power.  In {{SA|3429|n}} [[Sauron]] captured Minas Ithil and burnt the White Tree.<ref name="SA"/>  Yet Isildur escaped with his wife and sons, and a seedling of the White Tree.  While Anárion held Osgiliath, Isildur and his family sailed down the Anduin, then northwest to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]] and his father in Arnor.<ref name="Rings"/>

===The War of the Last Alliance===
In {{SA|3430}}, the same year that Isildur's fourth son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] was born, Isildur's father Elendil and Gil-galad formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]].  The army of the Alliance marched to [[Rivendell|Imladris]] in {{SA|3431|n}}, where Isildur left his wife and Valandil before the host moved on.  In {{SA|3434|n}} the combined armies of Elves and Men crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] and marched on to the [[Dagorlad]].  There the forces of Sauron were defeated and he retreated into the [[Barad-dûr]] to withstand a siege.<ref name="SA"/>

The siege lasted seven years, but finally Elendil and Gil-galad threw down Sauron, thus winning the battle though both were slain and Elendil's sword [[Narsil]] broke under him as he fell.  Isildur took the hilt shard of his father's sword and cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron's finger.  Ignoring the advice of [[Elrond]] and [[Círdan]], lieutenant of Gil-galad, Isildur did not destroy the Ring; instead he claimed it as a weregild for the deaths of his father and brother, and an heirloom for his House. <ref name="Rings"/>

===Triumph and Disaster===
After the fall of Sauron, Isildur returned to Gondor and assumed the [[Elendilmir]], proclaiming his Kingship in Arnor and sovereign lordship over the [[Dúnedain]] in both the North and the South. <ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>  He remained for a year in the South, planted the seedling of the White Tree in Minas Anor in memory of his brother [[Anárion]], put the realm to order, and instructed his nephew [[Meneldil]], son of Anárion, in the governance of the land.  With Meneldil and a company of trusted friends, Isildur rode about the boundaries of Gondor and in [[Anórien]] created the [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb]] and memorial of Elendil upon the hill of [[Eilenaer]], thereafter called [[Amon Anwar]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> While he remained there, he wrote an [[Scroll of Isildur|account]] on how he acquired the Ring, its significance to his [[House of Isildur|House]] and where he transcribed a [[Ring Verse|verse]] around the Ring while it was still hot.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

When Isildur finally felt free to leave he committed the rule of Gondor to Meneldil and with his three sons departed on [[5 September|5]]] [[Ivanneth]], {{TA|2}}.  Instead of heading west and then north they journeyed northwards along the Anduin in order to first come to Imladris where his wife and little son Valandil were.<ref name="Rings"/> On the thirtieth day of the journey, [[5 October|5]] [[Narbeleth]], the King, his sons, and his Guard of two hundred knights and soldiers reached the northern borders of the [[Gladden Fields]].  Isildur believed that all soldiers of the Enemy perished so his camp was unguarded.<ref name="Rings"/> There they were ambushed by a band of [[Orcs]] said to be ten times their number.

As the Orcs closed in, Isildur sent his esquire [[Ohtar]] with one companion to fly with the shards of Narsil. The enemy charged and charged again.  One by one Isildur's sons died about him; Elendur was the last and he insisted that Isildur leave with the One Ring. Isildur placed the Ring upon his finger and vanished from the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|battle]].

The Orcs could still sense his smell<ref name="Rings"/> and Isildur ran to the Anduin and swam across the river. It was during this effort that the One Ring slipped from his finger.  As he struggled to escape the reeds and rushes on the shore a small party of Orcs spotted him and shot him.  He fell back into the water and no trace of him was found by Elves or Men.<ref name="Gladden"/>

===Legacy===
The [[House of Isildur|line of Isildur]] continued, for Valandil became king of Arnor.  Isildur's line continued unbroken throughout the [[Third Age]] until it formed the basis for [[Aragorn]]'s claim to the kingship of Arnor and Gondor after the downfall of Sauron.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

In the riddling rhyme "''Seek for the Sword that was Broken''" the Ring is referred to cryptically as ''Isildur's Bane''.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]] the tower of [[Orthanc]] was opened, for King Elessar desired its restoration.  Behind a hidden door in a steel closet was found Isildur's [[Star of Elendil|Elendilmir]].  It was surmised that [[Saruman]] had found the bones of the long-lost king and had taken the ''[[mithril]]'' fillet with its jewel for his own, possibly destroying the king's remains afterwards.<ref name="Gladden"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Isildur.jpg|thumb|[[Harry Sinclair]] as Isildur in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Prince Isildur is mentioned in the [[Prologue: A Ring's Tale (1978 scene)|prologue]], and he is shown to cut the Ring off Sauron's hand in battle, rather than from a defeated Sauron.

'''2001-2002: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Isildur briefly appears in the first scenes of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|the first film]], as well as an extended flashback scene. Isildur is played by [[Harry Sinclair]]. Sinclair, a friend of [[Peter Jackson]], was asked because he was the most corrupt looking person Jackson knew. Sinclair had only one line, "No!", which was dubbed by [[Hugo Weaving]]. 

:In the movie, Isildur apparently is the last king of Gondor; Anárion and heirs and Arnor do not appear at all. However, in the Extended Editions both Arnor and the House of Anárion are mentioned, and at times it is clear that Isildur was not the last King, so this might be dialogue error. The story of Isildur's succumbing to the temptation of the Ring bothers Aragorn who fears that he could have the same weakness (a fear that is not evident in the book).

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)]]'':'''
:In the game starts with a prologue, where you control Isildur on the slopes of Mount Doom. After you complete the mission you see how Isildur defeats Sauron. By completing the Tower of Orthanc bonus level, Isildur becomes a playable character in the other stages, where he takes the place of his descendant Aragorn. Strangely, Isildur's version of the "Tower of Orthanc" level has the same script as Aragorn's, leading to Saruman referring to the ancient King of Gondor as a "ragtag Ranger".

[[File:Isildur-LOTRO.jpg|thumb|Isildur's appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Isildur appears only in cinematics battling [[Sauron]]. However, in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|expansion pack ''The Rise of the Witch-king'']], Isildur is mentioned more detailed in the [[Angmar]] campaign.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Isildur makes an appearance in a flashback scene titles "At the Stone of Erech". It covers the oath gives to Isildur by the men of [[Dunharrow]], subsequent return of Sauron several years later, the betrayal of the Dunharrow men and the curse that Isildur lays upon them.
