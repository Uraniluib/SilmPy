A '''Fishy Cart''' was a vehicle used by [[Ulmo]] to transport himself quickly through the waters of [[Arda]]. It was apparently a submersible war chariot, pulled by the great whale [[Uin]]. As it only appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', describing the earliest versions of the legendarium, it is unknown whether Ulmo still used this at later points in writing.
