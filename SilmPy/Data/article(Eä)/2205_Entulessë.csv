'''Entulessë''' was a ship which sailed by the great [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] mariner [[Vëantur]], who was [[Captain of the King's Ships]] in the time of [[Tar-Elendil]], [[Númenor]]'s fourth King. After nearly six hundred years, Entulessë was the first Númenórean vessel to make the journey back across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. 

According to the histories of Númenor, Vëantur sailed the ship into the harbour of the [[Grey Havens]] in the spring of {{SA|600}}. [[Gil-galad]] was still King in [[Lindon]] at that time, and Vëantur remained in his land for some months. As the following year turned to autumn, Entulessë set sail once again, beginning the long journey home to Númenor.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
