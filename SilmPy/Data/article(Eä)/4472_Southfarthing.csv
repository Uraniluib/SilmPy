The '''Southfarthing''' was the southmost and warmest [[Farthings|farthing]] of [[The Shire]].
==Geography==
Its northernmost point was the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], its eastern border was the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] River, and much of its border with the [[Eastfarthing]] ran along the River [[Shirebourn]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

Other features include:
*Hills: Part of the [[Green Hill Country]]
*Roads: An unnamed road crossed the Southfarthing to [[Sarn Ford]].
*Towns: Longbottom, [[Pincup]].

==History==
About {{TA|1630}} many [[Stoors]] from [[Dunland]] entered and settled in the Southfarthing,<ref name="third">{{App|TA}}</ref> and thereafter [[Stoors|Stoorish]] characteristics and appearance were common among the Hobbits in that region.

[[Tobold Hornblower]] of Longbottom first grew pipe-weed in the Southfarthing about the year {{TA|2670}}.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

[[Saruman]], having received reports on [[Gandalf]]’s movements and noting his interest in the Shire, began keeping agents in the Southfarthing in {{TA|2953}}.<ref name="third"/>

The Southfarthing was where [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] began his rise to power during the [[War of the Ring]], based on the substantial property in the region that he inherited from his father.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref> Presumably it was he who began exporting pipe-weed to Saruman.

==Culture==
This was the region where most of the Shire's [[pipe-weed]] production was concentrated, in warm sheltered places like [[Longbottom]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> Another noted product of the Southfarthing was the strong red wine called [[Old Winyards]].<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>
