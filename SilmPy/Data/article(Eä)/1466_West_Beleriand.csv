'''West Beleriand''' covered the lands of [[Beleriand]] to the west of the River [[Sirion]]; they were for the most part under the lordship of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] in [[Nargothrond]], and [[Círdan]] the Shipwright in the [[Falas]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==Geography==
West Beleriand was the region of Beleriand facing [[Belegaer]] to the west with the coast of [[Falas]] and the havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] and the seaward tower of [[Barad Nimras]]. To the north the [[Ered Wethrin]] separated [[Hithlum]] and [[Nevrast]] from the rest of Beleriand.  The forested strip of [[Nivrim]] was in West Beleriand, separated from the rest of [[Doriath]] by Sirion.  To the south, [[Nan Tathren]] was the small forested area between Narog and Sirion. Further south, the land of [[Arvernien]] with the forest of [[Nimbrethil]] formed the [[Bay of Balar]], ending to the [[Cape Balar]].

Rivers included [[Brithon]] and [[Nenning]] and the tributaries to Sirion, [[Narog]] (with [[Ginglith]] and [[Ringwil]]) and [[Taeglin]] (with [[Malduin]] and other minor rivers). Between Ginglith and Narog was the field of [[Tumhalad]]. The [[Ravines of Taeglin]] surrounded the [[Forest of Brethil]]. 

Between Narog and Sirion lay [[Talath Dirnen]], a part of the Realm of Nargothrond with the hill of [[Amon Rûdh]]. To that realm also belonged [[Taur-en-Faroth]] to the west of Narog.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

At its widest this region was ninety-nine leagues across.<ref> {{LR|Quenta}}, p. 272</ref>
