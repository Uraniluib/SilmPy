{{disambig-more|Atanatar|[[Atanatar (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Atanatári''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[aˌtanaˈtaːri]}}; singular '''Atanatar''', pron. {{IPA|[aˈtanatar]}}) is a [[Quenya]] term which means "Fathers of [[Men]]", and is used to describe the forefathers of the [[Edain]].<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref>

Its use is not exactly clear: sometimes it is used to refer to the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]], other times it is only applied to [[Bëor]], [[Marach]] and contemporaries, and in yet other places it is used to refer to those peoples the [[Edain]] are descended from.

If the third meaning is adopted, it can be said that the so-called [[Middle Men]] of [[Middle-earth]] (the [[Rohirrim]], [[Men]] of [[Dale]], etc.) are also descendants from the ''Atanatári'', like the ''[[Edain]]'' (or later [[Dúnedain]]).

The [[Sindarin]] form of the word is '''[[Edenedair]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[eˈdeneda͡ɪr]}}), singular '''[[Adanadar]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[aˈdanadar]}}).
