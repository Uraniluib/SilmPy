'''Nessa''' was the wife of [[Tulkas]] and sister of [[Oromë]]. In "due order," Nessa was the last named [[Valier|Valië]].<ref name=SIIb/> 

==History==
Nessa was noted for her speed, swift as an arrow, and ability to outrun the [[Deer|deer]] who followed her in the wild. She was also renowned for her dancing ability, as she danced on the ever-green lawns of [[Valimar]].<ref name=SIIb>{{S|IIb}}</ref> She wed Tulkas upon the Isle of [[Almaren]]<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref> in the [[Years of the Lamps|Year of the Lamps]] 3400.<ref>{{MR|P2a}}, 3400</ref> 

Nessa loved to retire to the green swards which her brother, Oromë, had cultivated from the richness of his forest.<ref name=Coming/>{{rp|75}} When creating the forests of Oromë, [[Yavanna]] had planted forest glades with spells so that the glades would always remain green and smooth, and Nessa along with her maidens would dance there as long as [[Laurelin]] was in bloom.<ref name=Coming>{{LT1|III}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Nessa'' ({{IPA|[ˈnesːa]}}) is a [[Quenya]] word meaning "young"; in the same text, Nessa has also the name '''[[Indis]]''' "bride".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 376-7</ref><ref>{{PE|14}}</ref>{{rp|14}} 

The [[Noldorin]] names of Nessa were '''Neth''' (a cognate of the Quenya/[[Qenya]] word) or '''Dineth''', a Noldorin word meaning "bride", related to the Quenya word ''indis''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry NI1</ref>

In a later text, [[Pengolodh]] notes that Nessa's name is "not [[elvish]]" and probably represents a [[Valarin]] title, much like the name of her spouse, adopted in Quenya, but there is no record.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

===Early etymology===
Her names were '''Helinyetille''' meaning "Eyes of Heartsease", from ''helin'' ("violet, pansy"), and '''Melesta''', from ''mele'' ("to love").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Nessa was one of the [[Valarindi]], daughter of [[Aule]] and [[Yavanna]]. Her son with Tulkas was [[Telimektar]].

Nessa was seen at the [[House of Tulkas]] bringing goblets of wine and drinks to his champions.<ref name=Coming/>{{rp|75}}
