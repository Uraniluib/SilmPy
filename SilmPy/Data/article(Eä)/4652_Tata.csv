'''Tata''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtata]}}) was the second of the three [[Elf-fathers]] who awoke at [[Cuiviénen]] after [[Imin]]. His spouse was [[Tatië]].

When the three Fathers walked, Tata, as the second to awake, took the second group of 18 Elves he found. He also took the fourth group of 36 Elves, because Imin refused, expecting an even greater group, so he gathered 56 companions.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi|}}, pp. 421-3.</ref>

He became the head of the Clan named after him [[Tatyar]], the "Seconds".<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 380-1.</ref>
