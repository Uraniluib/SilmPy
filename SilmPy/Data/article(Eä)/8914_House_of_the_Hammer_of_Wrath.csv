The '''House of the Hammer of Wrath''' was one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim|kindred]] of [[Gondolin]] whose lord was [[Rog]].  They were great smiths and craftsmen, and revered [[Aulë]]. In battle they carried great maces like hammers, and heavy shields, for they had strong arms.  The device of this people was the [[Stricken Anvil]], and a hammer that smites sparks about it; this was set upon their shields, for red gold and black iron was their delight.  They had a great hatred for [[Morgoth]] and the [[Balrogs]], and during the [[Fall of Gondolin]] they slew a number of the fell beasts, being the first of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] alike to slay a balrog. All of them perished in that battle, when a large force of Balrogs, [[Orcs]] and [[Fire-drakes]] was unleashed upon them.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
