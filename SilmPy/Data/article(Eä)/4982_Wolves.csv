'''Wolves''' were of old allied with the [[Dark Lord]];<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> [[Morgoth]] bred the two greatest of their kind, [[Draugluin]] and [[Carcharoth]], and [[Sauron]] was wont to take the form of a great Wolf. The lesser kinds were sometimes used as steeds by the [[Orcs]].

'''Wolf''' is also used as a short form of '''[[Werewolves|Werewolf]]'''.

==Inspiration==
* Possibly wolves on the plains outside [[Bloemfontein]].
{{quote|Only a few hundred yards beyond the houses [in Bloemfontein] was the open veldt where '''wolves, wild dogs''', and jackals roamed and menaced the flocks, and where after dark a post-rider might be attacked by a marauding lion.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

==Portrayal in adaptations == 

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'''''
:[[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] believes that wolves are in the Shire, and demands that [[Frodo Baggins]] alert the local [[Shirriff]], [[Robin Smallburrow]] about it by ringing Bywater's town bell. Robin initially dismisses Lobelia and Frodo's warning, but this changes when he is attacked by a white wolf the following night, and Frodo must save him. More wolves are encountered outside Bywater, then in the [[Old Forest]], the [[Barrow-downs]], and the streets of [[Bree]]. 

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Wolves are found in nearly every corner of Middle-earth. They are a popular mount of goblins, especially in Moria and Mirkwood.
