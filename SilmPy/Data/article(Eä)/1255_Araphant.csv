'''Araphant''' ({{TA|1789}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 195</ref> - {{TA|1964|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 175) was the fourteenth king of [[Arthedain]], and came to the throne upon the death of his father, [[Araval]], in 1891.

==History==
Despite his father's successes, [[Angmar]] rebuilt its strength and continued its attacks on Arthedain which Araphant struggled to hold off with dwindling strength.<ref name="Elendil"/>  Arthedain had been at war with Angmar for 500 years, and this was taking its toll on the [[Dúnedain]] as their resistance was starting to fail.

It was during Araphant's reign that the long silence and estrangement between the southern kingdom of [[Gondor]] and the northern kingdom ended when Araphant took counsel with the [[King of Gondor]]'s son, [[Ondoher]]. They realised that a single force was co-ordinating the attacks on both of their kingdoms and that they should work together to combat this evil.  In {{TA|1940|n}}, Araphant's son, [[Arvedui]], married the daughter of [[Ondoher]], [[Fíriel]], in token of the new alliance between Gondor and Arthedain.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

However, the alliance proved fruitless because neither kingdom could spare help for the other.  Arthedain was soon attacked by the forces of the [[Witch-king]], whilst Gondor was under attack by the [[Wainriders]].

When Ondoher died four years later, [[Gondor]] was left kingless, so [[Arvedui]] claimed the kingship of Gondor on behalf of his wife, but the Steward [[Pelendur]] persuaded the [[Council of Gondor]] to select [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], a distant relative of Ondoher, instead. However, the heirs of Arvedui did not forget this and claimed to be the heirs of both [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

Araphant ruled Arthedain for seventy-three years and was succeeded by his son, Arvedui,<ref name="North"/> who was the last king until [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].

== Etymology ==
Araphant's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Full King, King of All" possibly "Supreme King" from ''[[ar|ara-]]'' meaning "royal, king" and ''pant'' meaning "full" (his name could be seen as coming from ''[[aran]]'' and ''pant'', and the ''n+p'' mutating into ''ph''). His name could be a reference to Araphant asserting himself as the [[Kings of Arnor|king]] of all [[Arnor]].
