'''Harlindon''' was a green and fair elvish land on the north-western shores of [[Middle-earth]]. It was located west of the [[Blue Mountains]] and south of the [[Gulf of Lune]], which divided Lindon into the northern [[Forlindon]] and the southern Harlindon. At the head of the Gulf lay the seaport [[Grey Havens]].

There were woods at the foot of the Blue Mountains and a haven in a small inlet on the southern shores of the Gulf called [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[Second Age]], refugees of the [[War of Wrath]] came to Lindon, with [[Sindar]] being the most of those concentrating to Harlindon, along with [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. Celeborn ruled the [[Elves of Lindon|Elves of Harlindon]], until the couple moved to [[Eregion]] in {{SA|750}}.<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}</ref><ref name=gal2>{{UT|Galadriel}}, Note 2</ref>
