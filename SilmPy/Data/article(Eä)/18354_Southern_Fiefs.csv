The '''Southern Fiefs''' or '''Outlands''' of [[Gondor]] were the provinces of the South-kingdom. 

These seaboard lands along the [[Bay of Belfalas]] provided much of [[Minas Tirith]]'s needs: [[fish]] from the [[Ethir Anduin|Ethir]], [[:Category:Flowers|flowers]] from [[Lossarnach]], and at earlier times, stone from [[Anórien]]. The fiefs also provided skilled soldiers. 

By the late [[Third Age]], most regions of Gondor were either deserted or overrun and only the Southern Fiefs remained. During the [[War of the Ring]], the Outlands are under attack from the south by a large army of [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs from Umbar]], allies of [[Mordor]], and they sent small reinforcements to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

The Southern Fiefs were:
* [[Dor-en-Ernil]]
* [[Lossarnach]]
* [[Lebennin]]
* [[Belfalas]]
* [[Ethir Anduin]]
* [[Lamedon]]
* [[Anfalas]] and the [[Pinnath Gelin|Green Hills]]
* [[Blackroot Vale]]
* [[Ringló Vale]]

==Etymology==
A [[wikipedia:Fiefdom|fief]] is, in feudalism, a piece of inheritable land given to a vassal. The vassal returned this gift with (military) allegiance and/or revenue.
