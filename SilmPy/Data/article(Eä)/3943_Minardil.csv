'''Minardil''', {{TA|1454}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|1634|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> was the twenty-fifth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Since the end of the [[Kin-strife]], when the sons of [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]] escaped to [[Umbar]], the rebels had unceasingly made war upon [[Gondor]], raiding the coast and assailing ships.  However, his father [[Hyarmendacil II]] had soundly defeated the [[Haradrim]] who were in league with Umbar.

During Minardil's brief reign his Steward was [[Húrin of Emyn Arnen]].  

In {{TA|1634}} Minardil visited [[Pelargir]], thinking that there was no peril.  He was wrong for spies informed Castamir's great-grandsons [[Angamaitë]] and [[Sangahyando]] of the King's presence in the city.  Quickly they launched a great raid in which Minardil was slain, Pelargir ravaged, and great booty taken.<ref name="Elendil"/>

After Minardil's reign the Kings always chose their stewards from among Húrin's descendants, and eventually the Stewardship would become hereditary within the [[House of Húrin]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>
