'''Tincotéma''' was one of the four series of the [[Tengwar]] writing system.  As with all of the series it consisted of six characters in each of six ''[[Tyellë|tyeller]]'' or 'grades'.  This particular series took its name from the first of its signs, ''[[tinco]]'' (literally meaning 'metal', but here simply representing the character 't'). 
==Shapes==
Half of the symbols in this series had one bow or ''[[lúva]]'' while the other half had two bows.  All bows in this series were open, curving downwards and to the right from a stem, or ''[[telco]]'', which was either lowered, raised, or shortened. 
==Values==
In principle, the characters in this series could represent a variety of different sounds, though in practice their use had become essentially standardised by the [[Third Age]] to [[Wikipedia:Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and [[Wikipedia:Dental consonant|dental]] consonants. 

The first four signs in the series, ''[[tinco]]'', ''[[ando]]'', ''[[thúle]]'' and ''[[anto]]'', each represented a variant of the basic 't' sound: 't', 'd', 'th' and 'dh', respectively.  The fifth sign, ''[[númen]]'', represented 'n', and finally ''[[óre]]'' indicated a weak 'r' sound.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>
