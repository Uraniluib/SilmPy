'''Dunlendish''' was the [[Mannish]] tongue used by the [[Dunlendings]],<ref>{{App|Hobbits}}</ref> who inhabited the lands west of the [[Misty Mountains]] and northward from the [[Gap of Rohan]].

The language was [[Pre-Númenórean]], akin to the language of the [[Haladin]] of the [[First Age]].

Apparently Dunlendish was known also beyond the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]; the [[Great Gates]] of [[Moria]] included Dunlendish inscriptions in [[Cirth]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #8</ref>

At one time, a language akin to Dunlendish was spoken by some of the [[Hobbits]] of [[Stoors|Stoor-kind]], but by the later [[Third Age]] their descendants in [[the Shire]] had long abandoned it for the [[Westron|Common Speech]]. However such alien elements remained in [[Stoorish|their dialect]].

To this language belongs the word ''[[forgoil]]'', literally meaning 'strawheads', and used as an insult for their enemies, the [[Rohirrim]]. 

The only analysis that can be done with some degree of credibility, is that the final part -il could be the plural marker of the word; then, it would be reminiscent to the [[Elvish]] partitive plural -li, and perhaps related.<ref>[[Ardalambion]]: [https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm Mannish]</ref>
