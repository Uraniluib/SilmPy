The '''Black Breath''' was a weapon used by the [[Nazgûl]].  The Ringwraiths' breath was poisonous and could overpower those affected by it.

==History==
In the evening of [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] left [[the Prancing Pony]] and went for a stroll in [[Bree]].  He saw and followed (or was drawn by) a dark shadow, but then fell unconscious.  [[Aragorn|Strider]] stated that Merry had been overcome by the Black Breath.<ref>{{FR|I10}}</ref>

In the last retreat before the city of [[Minas Tirith]] was besieged, on [[13 March]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref name="Great"/> [[Faramir]] was struck by a dart shot by one of the Haradrim, which rendered him unconscious.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>  After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref name="Great"/> Aragorn came to the [[Houses of Healing]] and recognized that Faramir was suffering from the Black Breath.  Aragorn used ''[[athelas]]'' to cure Faramir, which led to the rapidly spread news that the King had returned.

Earlier, it appears that both Merry and [[Éowyn]] were exposed to the Black Breath when they fought the [[Witch-king]].  [[Aragorn]], after treating Faramir, also aided these two with ''athelas''.<ref name="House"/>
