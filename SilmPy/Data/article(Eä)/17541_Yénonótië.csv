The '''''Yénonótië''''' was a great work by the [[Lambengolmor|Loremaster]] [[Quennar]] in which he explained the chronology of the [[Valar]]. It included discussions on the lengths of [[Valian year|Valian years]], the Ages of the Valar, and the [[Years of the Sun]]. Some of the material in the ''Yénonótië'' was later quoted by [[Pengolodh]] in his enlargement of the ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]''.

==Etymology==
''Yénonótië'' means "Reckoning of Years" in [[Quenya]] (from the words ''[[yén]]'' '[[Valian year|long year]]' and ''onótië'', 'reckoning').
