The constellation [[Menelmacar]] is called '''Menelmakil''' in a note by Tolkien to his essay [[Quendi and Eldar]] (WJ 359-424) on the origin of the Elvish names for Elves: ' ''[[Telumehtar]]'' 'warrior of the sky', an older name for ''Menelmakil'', Orion' (Note 15, WJ 411).

In [[The Etymologies]] (s.v. MAK-; LR 371) the word ''makil'' is translated as 'sword', whereas 'warrior' is ''mahtar'' ( > -''mehtar'' in ''Telumehtar''; -''makar'' in ''Menelmacar'' ). The spelling ''Menelmakil'' may be just an error.

'''Abbreviations:'''
LR = [[The Lost Road and Other Writings]] (The History of Middle-earth, vol. 5).
WJ = [[The War of the Jewels]] (The History of Middle-earth, vol. 11).
