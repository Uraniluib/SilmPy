==Notes==
According to astronomy, the moon on that day of 3019, would have be a waning gibbous, which rises after midnight (and thus early on [[14 January|January 14]]) until it passes over the [[Misty Mountains]] and shine on the ''western'' side where the Gate was. 

So the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]] must be incorrect when it has the Company enter Moria before midnight on the 13th.<ref>http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html</ref>
