[[File:Matěj Čadil - Tower of Tar-Meneldur.jpg|thumb|right|"Tower of Tar-Meneldur" by [[:Category:Images by Matěj Čadil|Matěj Čadil]]]] '''Forostar''' was the northern promontory of [[Númenor]], a land of rocks, cliffs and high moors with woods of fir and larch.<ref name="Numenor">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> It stretched some two hundred miles from its southern borders with the [[Mittalmar]] to its [[North Cape]].<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> The great road from [[Rómenna]] to [[Andúnië]] passed through its southern parts, at the place known as [[Ondosto]].<ref name="Numenor"/>

The lands farther north, toward the Cape, became rockier and more mountainous. In the far north was a region around the peak of [[Sorontil]], where the landscape fell sheer into the sea forming tremendous cliffs. This was the abode of [[Eagles]], and also the dwelling-place of [[Tar-Meneldur|Meneldur Elentirmo]], heir to Númenor's throne and a watcher of the stars, who built a great tower here to follow the movements of the heavens.<ref name="Numenor"/>
