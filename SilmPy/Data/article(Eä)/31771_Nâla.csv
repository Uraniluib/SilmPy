__NOTOC__
'''''nâla''''' is a [[Khuzdul]] word. In one instance [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] translates ''nâla'' as "channel".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], "[[Index questions]]" (quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. 269)</ref> Later he would say that the meaning is unknown but suggested that it might mean "path, course, rivercourse, or bed", a meaning it would share with [[Sindarin]] ''[[rant]]'' of ''[[Celebrant]]''.<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 175</ref>
