The '''Elves of Sirion''' were members of a short-lived Elven culture that grew up in the lands around the [[Mouths of Sirion]] during the last years of the [[First Age]]. They were mainly [[Elves]] that had fled from the destruction of the great realms of [[Beleriand]], especially [[Gondolin]] and [[Doriath]]. Many of these Elves were killed, not by the [[Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]], but by the remaining [[Sons of FÃ«anor]] who sought the [[Silmaril]] of [[Elwing]], who dwelt with the Elves of Sirion.
