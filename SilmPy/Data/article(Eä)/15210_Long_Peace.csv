The '''Long Peace''' is a term referring to the extended peace in [[Beleriand]] in the [[First Age]] during which [[Morgoth]] did not try to break the [[Siege of Angband]]. It began when [[Glaurung]] was defeated<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref> in the First Age year {{FA|260|n}}<ref name="GA260">{{GA|260}}</ref> and ended with the [[Dagor Bragollach]]<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> in {{FA|455|n}}<ref>{{GA|145}}</ref> – lasting some 195 years.

During this period the [[Elves|Elven]] peoples in north west [[Middle-earth]] prospered. It was also during the Long Peace that the [[Edain]] passed into Beleriand from the east.

==History==
The forces of [[Darkness]] attempted to break the Siege of Angband. Glaurung the Worm managed to drive the [[Noldor]] off [[Ard-galen]], however he was too young, and was pushed back by [[Fingon]]. It was then decided that Glaurung should wait to mature until ready to strike back.<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref> This long wait allowed for the races of Beleriand to recover and prosper.

The first major event during those years was the arrival of the [[Edain]] into Beleriand, looking for the land of the [[Valar|Gods]] in the [[Uttermost West|West]]. [[Finrod]] quickly befriended these first [[Men]] and advised them to settle in [[Estolad]] in the realm of [[Amrod]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> In {{FA|402}}, [[Orcs]] attempted to break through the [[Pass of Aglon]], but the people of [[Bëor]] helped [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]] throw back the invaders.<ref>{{GA|125}}</ref> This was the first time Men fought on behalf of the [[Eldar]]. Their head was also given the region of [[Ladros]] of [[Dorthonion]]. 

Around that time, the [[Haladin]], the [[House of Marach|people of Marach]], and the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] crossed over the [[Blue Mountains]] into [[Beleriand]]. 

The Haladin dwelt in [[Thargelion]] as scattered groups until a host of orcs assaulted their territory in {{FA|375}}. They built a stockade between the angle of [[Gelion]] and [[Ascar]] until [[Caranthir]]'s army could relieve them. [[Haleth]] declined a fief in his lands and moved on to [[Talath Dirnen]] to settle in the [[Forest of Brethil]].

The Marachians remained in Estolad after the Beorians, becoming close allies with the [[House of Fingolfin]] in [[Hithlum]] and then moved to the southern slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]]; during the time of [[Hador]] in {{FA|416}} they were granted permanent fief of [[Dor-lómin]].

The period ended when the Siege was broken in the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
