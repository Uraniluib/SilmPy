'''Great beasts''' were used to pull the battering ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] during the [[Siege of Gondor|siege of Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>

Whether these beasts of burden used by [[Sauron]] were a foul breed, [[Oliphaunts|Mûmakil]], or a race of unknown animals from distant lands, is impossible to say for certain as we lack a more detailed description of the creatures.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''

:The great beasts are depicted as rhinoceros-like creatures. In the Weta Workshop [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|''Return of The King'' documentary]] it is revealed they are based off of [[Wikipedia:Megacerops|Brontotherium]] in appearance.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''

:In this video game the basic design of the great beasts from Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' is kept. However, a new idea is introduced: the creatures called "great beasts" were originally used by Dwarves in the Misty Mountains as underground draft animals (depicted as being much smaller than Sauron's beasts of burden). The Dwarves called them ''yurgs''.<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/690/690364p3.html Battle for Middle-earth II - The Dwarves] at [http://pc.ign.com/ IGN], accessed 16 October 2010</ref>
