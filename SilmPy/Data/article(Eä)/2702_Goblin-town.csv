'''Goblin-town''' was a [[Orcs#Goblins and Orcs|Goblin]] (or [[Orcs|Orc]]) dwelling which lay under the [[Misty Mountains]], ruled by the [[Great Goblin]].

The main gate of the town was in one of the passes of the Misty Mountains, but as travellers avoided that dangerous road, the goblins opened another under the safer [[High Pass]] (the [[Front Porch]]). Goblin-town was a series of tunnels and caverns, which went all the way through the mountains, with a "back door" (the [[Goblin-gate]]) near the [[Eagle's Eyrie]] in [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], which served as a means of escape, and an access to the Wilderland.<ref name=pan>{{H|Pan}}</ref> The cave of [[Gollum]] was deep beneath Goblin-town yet was connected to the Goblins' tunnels, with one passage leading to the "back door".<ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{app|TA}}</ref> during the journey to [[Lonely Mountain]], [[Thorin and Company]] were captured by the Goblins of Goblin-town. They were brought before the Great Goblin, who accused them of spying, and was enraged when he found that Thorin was carrying [[Orcrist]], a sword the Great Goblin remembered from [[Gondolin]]. With the help of [[Gandalf]], the Great Goblin was slain and Bilbo and the Dwarves escaped, pursued by force of Goblins.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>
