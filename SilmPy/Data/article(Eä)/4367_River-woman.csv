The '''River-woman''' was a mysterious person — apparently some kind of [[Spirits (creatures)|water-spirit]] — associated with the [[Withywindle]] in the [[Old Forest]].  She was the mother of [[Goldberry]], who was for this reason known as the "River-daughter".  

In a poem, [[Tom Bombadil]] was pulled into the river by the swimming Goldberry she swam "back to her mother's house in the deepest hollow". Later, Tom returned to the river and asked the River-woman for Goldberry's hand; she complied unquestionably, so the two were married.<ref>{{AB|Tom}}</ref>
