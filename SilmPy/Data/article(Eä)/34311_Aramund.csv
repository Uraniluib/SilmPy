'''''Aramund''''' is an [[Elvish]] word said to mean "Kingly bull".<ref name=L>{{L|345}}</ref>

[[Helge Fauskanger]] includes the word in his [[Neo-Quenya]] wordlist, but notes that the form "''may not be pure [[Quenya]], because of the final consonant cluster''".<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 25 June 2011)</ref>

==Etymology==

As the Elvish element ''[[ar|ar(a)]]'' is said to mean "high, noble, royal",<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, </ref> and an "elvish" word for "bull" is said to be ''[[mundo]]'',<ref>{{L|342}}</ref> it is likely that ''Aramund'' derives from these two elements (considering its given meaning, "Kingly bull").
