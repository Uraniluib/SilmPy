The '''Edge of the Wild''' was the counceptual boundary between most of [[Eriador]], which was or had been a settled area, and the dangerous uplands leading to the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[Wilderland]] beyond.  Conceptually it was a north-south line that ran just to the west of the [[Ford of Bruinen]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref>  When one was over (or east) of the Edge of the Wild even the best of plans could easily go astray, as [[Gandalf]] was well aware.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>
