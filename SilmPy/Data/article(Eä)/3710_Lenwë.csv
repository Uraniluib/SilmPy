'''Lenwë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈlɛnwɛ]}}; also named '''Dan''') was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Teleri|Telerin]] origin who set out on the [[Great Journey]] from [[Cuiviénen]].  When the [[Teleri]] reached the Great River [[Anduin]] and saw the [[Misty Mountains]] across their path to the west, they fell away from the Journey.  Lenwë led a part of the Teleri south down the [[Vales of Anduin]].  Lenwë's people afterwards became known as the [[Nandor]].

Lenwë had a son, [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]], who eventually crossed the Misty Mountains with a group of his father's people.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>
