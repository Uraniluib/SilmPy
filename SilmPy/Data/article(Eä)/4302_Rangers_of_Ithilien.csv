The '''Rangers of Ithilien''' were a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] special operations force, selected from the descendants of the people who had dwelt in [[Ithilien]] before it fell from [[Gondor]]'s control. Dressed in camouflaging green and brown, they crossed the [[Anduin]] in secret to harass the forces of the Enemy in Gondor's old domain and used several secret retreats in the region.<ref name="Herbs">{{TT|IV4}}</ref>
==History==
It is likely that the Rangers of Ithilien were established at the same time that [[Henneth Annûn]] was built, in {{TA|2901}} when most of the remaining inhabitants of the region departed due to [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]] attacks from [[Mordor]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> The Rangers' main task was to harry [[Sauron]]'s forces whenever they entered Ithilien.

At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] the leader of these Rangers was [[Faramir]], son of the [[Ruling Steward]] [[Denethor]].<ref name="Window">{{TT|IV5}}</ref> Other Rangers at that time were [[Damrod]], [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]],<ref name="Herbs"/> and [[Anborn]].<ref name="Window"/>

On [[7 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] witnessed a harassing attack by the Rangers of Ithilien upon a regiment of [[Haradrim|Southrons]] marching north.  The two hobbits were captured by Faramir and other Rangers and brought to Henneth Annûn.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>  Faramir learned of the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] carried by Frodo<ref name="Window"/> and captured [[Gollum]], but on [[8 March]] he let the three go to seek entry into Mordor.<ref>{{TT|IV6}}</ref>

Faramir and the Rangers of Ithilien left Henneth Annûn on [[9 March]].<ref name="Great"/>  The Rangers fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  When the [[Army of the West]] marched through Ithilien on its way to the [[Morannon]], a powerful force of [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]] tried to ambush its leading companies, but the Rangers of Ithilien, led by Mablung (since Faramir was recovering in the [[Houses of Healing]]) trapped the ambushers and destroyed them.<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>

After the defeat of [[Sauron]] it may be that the Rangers of Ithilien became the [[White Company]], the guard of Faramir, who became the [[Prince of Ithilien]] at the command of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 326, entry "Rangers of Ithilien"</ref>
