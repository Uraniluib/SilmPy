'''Minas Tirith''' was the tower on the island of [[Tol Sirion]] that guarded the [[Pass of Sirion]].

Minas Tirith was built around {{FA|60}}<ref>{{GA|85}}</ref> by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] to prevent the forces of [[Morgoth]] from invading [[Beleriand]] from the plains of [[Ard-galen]]. After Finrod built [[Nargothrond]] he handed over control of the watchtower to his nephew, [[Orodreth]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

In {{FA|457}} [[Sauron]] captured Minas Tirith in the aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and Orodreth fled south. The island was then called '''[[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]''', the "Isle of [[Werewolves]]".<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Although the [[Noldor]] regained control of the Pass of Sirion until the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"), they did not attempt to rebuild the tower.

==Etymology==
Minas Tirith means "Tower of the Guard" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[minas]]'' = "tower, citadel" and ''[[tirith]]'' = "watch, guard").
