__NOTOC__
'''''sar''''' (pl. *'''sarni''') is a noun meaning "stone" in [[Quenya]]. 
==Etymology==
From [[PQ]] *''sarno'', [[root]] [[SAR]].

''Sar'' is unusual in Quenya for being a proper one-syllable noun whose vowel is not compensatorily lengthened in the nominative case. One would expect *''sarno'' > **''s√°r''
==Example==
* [[Elessar]]
==Cognates==
*[[Sindarin]]: ''[[sarn]]''
==Other versions==
''[[The Etymologies]]'' give the stem of the word as ''sard-'' (eg. plural ''sardi'') however in another source, the stem of the name [[Elessar]] is given as ''Elesarno''<ref>{{VT|49a}}, p. 28</ref>. This, and the Sindarin word ''sarn'', point out that the stem was corrected by Tolkien to ''sarn-''.
