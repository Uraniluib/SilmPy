'''Pre-Númenórean''' is a term used to refer to several [[Mannish]] tongues and dialects in [[Gondor]] that predate [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] settlement. Its speakers were the [[Pre-Númenóreans]], including the folk of [[Agar]],<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref> the [[Drúedain]], the [[Oathbreakers|Men of Dunharrow]], the [[Dunlendings]]<ref name="AppF">{{App|Men}}</ref> and several other inhabitants of [[Lamedon]] and [[Anórien]].<ref name="CE51">{{UT|Cirion}}, note 51</ref>

==Roots==
Pre-Númenórean languages derived from the settlers who were separated relatives of the [[House of Haleth]]. Their members stayed back in [[Eriador]] while the [[Edain]] migrated to the west during the [[First Age]].<ref name="Drú"/>

Their language was foreign to [[Taliska]], the language of the other two tribes, and as a result, the evolved languages became distinctly alien from [[Adûnaic]],<ref name="AppF"/> being a closer to the tongue of the [[Haladin]].<ref name="Drú"/>

==Survival==
The only pre-Númenórean tongues that survived into the [[Third Age]] as active languages were [[Dunlendish]]<ref name="AppF"/> and the [[Drúedain]] tongue.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref> For the former, it was the result of a long enmity and a reluctance to speak [[Westron]],<ref name="AppF"/><ref name="HD">{{TT|Deep}}</ref> while in the latter case it was isolation.<ref name="Drú">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> 

The pre-Númenórean tongue of the [[Ethir Anduin|Ethir]] and [[Pelargir]] merged with [[Adûnaic]] into Westron.<ref name="AppF"/> Under the Númenórean dominion, the language only survived in placenames and personal names, such as [[Eilenach]]<ref name="CE51"/>, [[Min-Rimmon|Rimmon]] and [[Forlong]].<ref name="AppF"/>
