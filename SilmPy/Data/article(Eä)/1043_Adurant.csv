The river '''Adurant''' was the southernmost of the seven rivers of [[Ossiriand]] marking its southern boundary.  It ran from the southern [[Ered Luin]] into the river [[Gelion]], marking the southern boundary of [[Ossiriand]]. Halfway along its course the river divided and later rejoined, forming the island of [[Tol Galen]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name means ''Doublestream'' (from ''[[adu]]'' "double" and ''[[rant]]'' "course") in [[Sindarin]], referring to a parting of the river about the isle of Tol Galen.<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>
