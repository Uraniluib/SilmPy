'''Common Telerin''' was an ancient dialect of the [[Common Eldarin]], spoken by the [[Teleri]] or [[Lindar]] clan of the [[Elves]]. 

It became the common ancestor of both [[Valinor]]ean [[Telerin]] and the vernacular [[Elvish]] languages of the [[Westlands]] (the [[Sindarin]] dialects, and some of the [[Silvan Elvish]] like [[Nandorin]]).

==History==
It descended from [[Primitive Quendian]], the original language of all [[Quendi]], or Elves, but split off [[Common Eldarin]] early, at some time during the [[Great Journey]], perhaps because the Lindar were further off from both [[Minyar]] and [[Tatyar]].

Since many Teleri teams abandoned the March, and stayed in [[Middle-earth]], all the languages of [[Beleriand]] of the [[First Age]], like [[Sindarin]], and the various [[Nandor]]in languages in the East, are descendants of Common Telerin.

[[Telerin]] of Valinor as spoken by the [[Falmari]] we the branch of Common Telerin that reached the West.

==Characteristics==
One major Telerin change was that where Primitive Quendian used 'KW', Telerin had evolved it into 'P'. 

Another significant change was the simplification of palatal 'J' into the vowel 'I'. 

Another yet characteristic see in the Telerin languages was the loss of an unaccented pre-stress vowel, for example [[PQ]] ''[[turúmbê]]'' becomes ''[[trumbe|t'rumbê]]'' and *''berektâ'' becomes *''b'rektâ''.

A trait seen in Telerin languages was the evolution of the diphthong [[CE]] ''eu'' to ''iu'' in some dialects. For example *''beurô'' evolved into ''[[beor]]'' with the alternative form ''[[bior]]''. ''[[ndeuro]]'' evolved into [[Doriathrin]] ''[[dior]]''. 

In Telerin of Aman variants of the same word with ''iu'' would coexist with those in ''eu'' in its place.<ref>{{VT|48a}} p.7</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The model of Common Telerin belongs to a newer part of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings. In his personal early unpublished writings like ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the only languages which possess the qualities of the Telerin languages are [[Telerin]] and [[Old Noldorin]] (and by extension, [[Noldorin]]). 

The other languages of the [[Great Lands]] like [[Doriathrin]], [[Ilkorin]] etc don't; for example, they had retained the Primitive 'KW' (cf. Ilkorin ''[[cwess]]'' and Doriathrin ''[[cwindor]]'')

Fans who believe that those early languages are not obsolete in the later continuity, interpret them as dialects of Sindarin and/or Telerin languages in their minds. In that case those "anomalous" words that don't fit Telerin, are "updated" in [[Neo-Sindarin]] (for example *''pess'' and *''pindor'')
