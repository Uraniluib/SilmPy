The '''Scroll of Kings''' was a list of all the [[King of Númenor|Rulers]] of [[Númenor]]. These names were written in [[Quenya]], the tongue of the [[High Elves]] of [[Aman|the West]]. Even after the Kings of Númenor began to hate the Elves, they still used Quenya when they wrote their names into the Scroll, because they feared to break this tradition. For example, [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]], the first King to take an [[Adûnaic]] royal name, had the Quenya translation [[Tar-Herunúmen]] written into the Scroll.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> The original Scroll of Kings was probably destroyed in the [[Downfall of Númenor]], but copies of the same information, such as the ''[[Line of Elros (document)|Line of Elros]]'', survived the disaster and were later preserved in [[Gondor]].
