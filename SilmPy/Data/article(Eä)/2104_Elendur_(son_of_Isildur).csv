}}'''Elendur''' was the eldest son and heir of [[Isildur]], slain with his father in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]. He was also the most trusted son of Isildur, being the only son with knowledge of [[the One Ring]] borne by Isildur. Elendur was often said to be remarkably similar to [[Elendil]], his grandfather.<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

==History==
===Early History===
Elendur was born in [[Númenor]] in {{SA|3299}}, and escaped the downfall of the island with his family. In [[Middle-earth]], he stayed by his father's side, and fought with him in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. After the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], Elendur alone of Isildur's sons accompanied him into [[Mordor]]. Isildur sent [[Aratan]] and [[Ciryon]] to [[Minas Ithil]] to guard the pass against a possible escape. Elendur was not present at the final fight with [[Sauron]] on the slopes of [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 11</ref>

===Death===
In {{TA|2}}, Elendur joined a band of travellers escorting his father to [[Rivendell|Imladris]]. With his brothers, Aratan and Ciryon, and two hundred knights and soldiers, they passed [[Dagorlad]] and sought to follow [[Anduin]] upstream until [[Amon Lanc]]. From there, they followed old Sylvan paths on the eaves of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]]. On [[5 October]], when they were at the [[Gladden Fields]], the company was attacked by [[Orcs]] coming from the [[Misty Mountains]], but led by servants of [[Barad-dûr]]. 

Knowing of the Ring, Elendur argued with his father. Though Isildur had sent [[Ohtar]] away to preserve the shards of [[Narsil]], the King still bore the [[Elendilmir]] and the Ring. Elendur thought is was wise for his father to flee and abandon them: Ciryon was dead and Aratan was dying, and orcs overran them from all sides. Isildur did eventually flee, but was pierced by arrows after he swam across the Anduin. Elendur took command of what remained, and was slain with his troops.<ref name="Gladden"/>

==Etymology==
''Elendur'' most likely means "Servant of the [[Elves]]" in [[Quenya]]. The first element, ''[[eled]]'',<ref>{{L|297}}</ref> was likely taken from his grandfather's name. The later [[Elendur (King of Arnor)|King of Arnor Elendur]] was likely named after him.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In early manuscripts Elendur was named "Kiryandil" and his date of birth was {{SA|3318}}, which made him and not [[Meneldil]] the last man born in Númenor.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary</ref>
