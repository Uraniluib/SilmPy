The '''Rivil''' was a lesser tributary of the [[Sirion|Sirion River]]. Its source was [[Rivil's Well]] in the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], from which it flowed westward to meet the Sirion at the [[Fen of Serech]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

During the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] King [[Turgon]] retreated down the [[Pass of Sirion]]. His escape was successful because [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] formed a rearguard that used the Rivil as a defence. The host of [[Angband]] bridged the stream with the corpses of their dead. Huor was slain beside the Rivil and Húrin was captured.<ref>{{CH|2}}, p. 59</ref>
