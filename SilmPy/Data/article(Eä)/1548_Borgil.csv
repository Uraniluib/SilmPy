'''Borgil''' was a bright red star near the constellation of [[Menelvagor]].<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Borgil'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, composed of ''[[born]]'' "hot, red" and ''[[gil]]'' "star".<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]] have suggested that Borgil might either refer to the star [[wikipedia:Betelgeuse|Betelgeuse]] or the star [[wikipedia:Aldebaran|Aldebaran]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://thainsbook.net/stars.html|articlename=Stars & Other Celestial Bodies|dated=|website=[http://thainsbook.net/index.html The Thain's Book]|accessed=27 April 2013}}</ref>

Basing her approach both on literary assumptions and astronomical evidences, Prof. [[Kristine Larsen]] has argued that Borgil can be identified as Aldebaran.<ref>[[Kristine Larsen]], "A Definitive Identification of Tolkien’s `Borgil': An Astronomical and Literary Approach" in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'', vol. [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 2|2]] (pp. 161–170), West Virginia University Press, 2005</ref>
