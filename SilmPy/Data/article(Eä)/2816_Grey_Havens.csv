The '''Grey Havens''', also known as '''Mithlond''', was a seaport on the [[Gulf of Lune]] at the mouth of the River [[Lhûn]] in western [[Eriador]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

== History ==
Founded by the [[Elves of Lindon]] in {{SA|1}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> the Grey Havens were afterwards used by any of the Elves (whether [[Noldor]], [[Sindar]], or [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]]) to leave Middle-earth for [[Valinor]]. [[Círdan]] was Lord of the Havens, but throughout the Second Age [[Gil-galad]], [[High King of the Noldor]], ruled all of [[Lindon]] from the Grey Havens.<ref name="SA"/>

In {{SA|600}}, ''[[Entulessë]]'', a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ship headed by [[Captain of the King's Ships|Captain]] [[Vëantur]], arrived in Mithlond. It was the first time the Númenóreans landed in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="B1">{{App|B1}}, entry "600"</ref><ref name="Island">{{UT|Island}}</ref>

About {{TA|1000}} the [[Istari]] or Wizards arrived in [[Middle-earth]] at the Grey Havens. Círdan, upon meeting [[Gandalf]], gave him [[Narya]], the Elven Ring of Fire.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

In {{TA|1975}}, Prince [[Eärnur]] of [[Gondor]] brought a Gondorian fleet to the Grey Havens to aid [[Arthedain]] [[Angmar War|against]] [[Angmar]]. The fleet was so massive that the ships of Gondor filled the Grey Havens, as well as [[Forlond]] and [[Harlond]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

In {{TA|3018}},<ref name="TA"/> Círdan sent [[Galdor of the Havens]] "on an errand" to [[Rivendell]] and he became Círdan's representative at the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

Following the defeat of [[Sauron]] and the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]] in the [[War of the Ring]], [[Gandalf]], [[Elrond]], and [[Galadriel]] left [[Middle-earth]] for [[Valinor]] from the Grey Havens. The [[Last Riding of the Keepers]] was accompanied by [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Frodo Baggins]], who were given the honor of taking the [[Straight Road]] because they had both been a [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> Years later [[Fairbairn Family|Fairbairn]] family tradition held that [[Samwise Gamgee]] in {{FoA|61}} also sailed [[Aman|West]] from the Grey Havens because he too had been a Ring-bearer, even if just briefly.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>.

It is unclear how long the Grey Havens lasted into the [[Fourth Age]], as the number of Elves dwindled with the coming of the "Age of Men". Supposedly Círdan remained at the Havens until the last ship left from Middle-earth for the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]].

== Etymology ==
''Mithlond'' translates as "Grey Havens" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[mith]]'' "grey" and ''[[lond]]'' "harbour").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 28</ref>
