'''Frumgar''' was the fourth [[Lord of the Éothéod]] and the grandson of [[Forthwini]].<ref group=note>His father's name is not recorded.</ref>

During his youth the [[Éothéod]] lived in the [[Vales of Anduin]], near [[Mirkwood|Mirkwood Forest]]. It was a dangerous area, beleaguered by the creatures of the [[Necromancer]] at [[Dol Guldur]]. However, in {{TA|1975}} the evil [[Angmar|Kingdom of Angmar]] was [[Battle of Fornost|destroyed]], freeing up land to the north. In {{TA|1977}} Frumgar led the Éothéod to the vale between the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 

The settlement later known as [[Framsburg]] after his son, [[Fram]], was built there.<ref>''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''</ref>
