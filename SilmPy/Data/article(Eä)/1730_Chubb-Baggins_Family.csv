The '''Chubb-Baggins Family''' was a family created by the wedding of [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s uncle [[Bingo Baggins]] to [[Chica Chubb]]. Double surnames were not uncommon in [[the Shire]], and were used when the daughter of the head of the family married. This way, the family name would be preserved.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref>
