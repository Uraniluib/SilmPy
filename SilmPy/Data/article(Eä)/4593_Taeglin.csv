The '''Taeglin''' was a river in [[Beleriand]], a tributary of [[Sirion]].
It rose in the [[Ered Wethrin]] and flowed southeast through [[Brethil]] to join Sirion on the borders of [[Doriath]]. It had two minor tributaries: [[Celebros]] and [[Malduin]].

The river could be forded at the [[Crossings of the Taeglin]], near the western border of Brethil. A road ran through it from [[Nargothrond]] to [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]].
==Etymology==
The element ''[[taeg]]'' means "boundary".<ref name="WJ">{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 309-10</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier writings, the river was called '''Teiglin'''. As revealed in the ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, the rivername should actually have been spelt ''Taeglin'' ("Boundary River").<ref name="WJ"/> This was a relatively late change which was not adopted into the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which uses the old name, as does ''[[The Children of HÃºrin]]''.
