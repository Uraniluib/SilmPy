The '''Noldor''' ([[Third Age]] Exilic [[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈnoldor]}}) or '''Ñoldor''' (older and [[Aman]]ya Q, pron. {{IPA|[ˈŋoldor]}}) were those of the second clan of the [[Elves]] who came to [[Aman]]. They were highly skilled in crafts and gained much knowledge, which they passed on to [[Men]] after their [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]]. Their [[King of the Noldor|King]] was originally [[Finwë]], but he was slain by [[Morgoth]], leading his son [[Fëanor]] to avenge him and the theft of his [[Silmarils|jewels]] by making war upon Morgoth in [[Middle-earth]]. The war of the Noldor against Morgoth comprises many of the tales of the [[First Age]].

==History==
According to legend, the clan was founded by [[Tata]], the second Elf to awake at [[Cuiviénen]]. With him were his spouse Tatië and their 54 companions, and this clan became known as the '''Tatyar'''. [[Finwë]], the first Ñoldor to come to [[Valinor]] with [[Oromë]], became their King, and led most of them to Valinor. Out of the original 56 Tatyar who awoke at Cuiviénen, 28 remained at the place of their awakening, becoming [[Avari]], while the other original 28 and their offspring continued on their [[Great Journey]].

===The Noldor in Valinor===
The Noldor were accounted the greatest of the Elves and all the peoples in [[Middle-earth]] in lore, warfare and crafts. In Valinor "great became their knowledge and their skill; yet even greater was their thirst for more knowledge, and in many things they soon surpassed their teachers. The Noldor were changeful in speech, for they had great love of words, and sought ever to find names more fit for all things they knew or imagined". They were beloved of [[Aulë]] the Smith, and were the first to discover and carve gems. Their chief dwelling-place was the city of [[Tirion]] upon [[Túna]]. Among the wisest of the Noldor were [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], creator of the first writing system and author of many books of lore. [[Fëanor]], son of Finwë and [[Míriel]], was the greatest of their craftsmen, "mightiest in skill of word and of hand", and creator of the [[Silmarils]].

The Noldor earned the greatest hatred of [[Morgoth|Melkor]], who envied their prosperity and, most of all, the Silmarils. So he went often among them, offering counsel, and the Noldor hearkened, being eager for lore. But amid his seemingly good advice, Melkor sowed lies to turn one House of the Noldor against another, and in the end the peace in Tirion was poisoned. After threatening his half-brother [[Fingolfin]], Fëanor was banished from Tirion by the [[Valar]], and with him went Finwë his father. Fingolfin remained as the ruler of the Noldor of Tirion.

But Melkor had yet other designs to accomplish. Soon after with the aid of [[Ungoliant]] he destroyed the [[Two Trees]], and coming to [[Formenos]] he killed Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and departed from Aman. Fëanor, driven by grief and desiring vengeance, rebelled against the Valar by coming back into Tirion and making a speech before the Noldor, in which he persuaded them to leave Valinor, follow Melkor to [[Middle-earth]], and wage war against him for the recovery of the Silmarils. He swore a terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]], as did his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]], to pursue Melkor and reclaim the Silmarils at all costs. Fëanor then claimed the title of the High King since his father was dead, but though the greater part of the Noldor still held Fingolfin as King, they followed Fëanor into [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]] due to their valor.

====The Kinslaying====
The Noldor led by Fëanor demanded that the [[Teleri]] let them use their ships. When the Teleri refused, they took the ships by force, committing the first [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|kinslaying]]. A messenger from the Valar came later and delivered the [[Doom of Mandos]], pronouncing judgment on the Noldor for the Kinslaying and rebellion and warning that if they proceeded they would not recover the Silmarils and moreover would be slain or tormented by grief. At this, some of the Noldor who had no hand in the Kinslaying, including [[Finarfin]] son of Finwë and [[Indis]], returned to Valinor, and the Valar forgave them. Other Noldor led by Fingolfin (some of whom were blameless in the Kinslaying) remained determined to leave Valinor for Middle-earth. Prominent among these others was Finarfin's son, [[Finrod]].

===Exile to Middle-earth===
The Noldor led by Fëanor crossed the sea to Middle-earth, leaving those led by Fingolfin, his half-brother, behind. Upon his arrival in Middle-earth, Fëanor had the ships burned. When the Noldor led by Fingolfin discovered their betrayal, they went farther north and crossed the sea at the [[Grinding Ice]] which cost them many lives.

Fëanor's company was soon attacked by Morgoth. When Fëanor rode too far from his bodyguard during the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], several [[Balrogs|Balrogs]], including their Lord [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], fought him. Despite battling valiantly, Fëanor was mortally wounded and would have been captured and taken to Angband had it not been for the swift arrival of his sons. However, Fëanor died whilst being taken back to his own people. 

Because Fëanor had taken the ships and left the Noldor led by his half-brother on the west side of the sea, much enmity remained between the royal Houses of the Noldor. [[Fingon]] son of Fingolfin, saved [[Maedhros]] Fëanor's son from Morgoth's imprisonment, however, and the feud was settled. Maedhros was due to succeed Fëanor, but he regretted his part of the Kinslaying and left the High Kingship of the Noldor to his uncle Fingolfin, who became the first High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth. His brothers did not agree to this, and began to refer to themselves as ''the Dispossessed'', because the High Kingship had passed them by.

====Kingdoms of the Noldor====
In the north-west of Middle-earth the Noldor made alliance with the [[Sindar]], the Elves of [[Beleriand]], and later with Men of the Three Houses of the [[Edain]]. Fingolfin reigned long in the land of [[Hithlum]], and his younger son [[Turgon]] built the Hidden City of [[Gondolin]]. The Sons of Fëanor ruled the lands in Eastern Beleriand, while Finrod Finarfin's son was the King of [[Nargothrond]] and his brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] held [[Dorthonion]]. Fingolfin's reign was marked by warfare against Morgoth and in the year 60 of the First Age after their victory in [[Dagor Aglareb]] the Noldor started the [[Siege of Angband]], the great fortress of Morgoth. In the year 455 the Siege was broken by Morgoth in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], in which the north-eastern Elvish realms were conquered. Fingolfin in despair rode to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. He dealt Morgoth seven wounds but perished, and he was succeeded by his eldest son Fingon, who became the second High King of the Noldor in Beleriand.

====The Nirnaeth Arnoediad====
In the year 472, Maedhros organised an all-out attack on Morgoth and this led to the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. Betrayed by the new-come [[Easterlings]], the forces of the Noldor, Sindar and Edain were utterly defeated. Fingon the Valiant was slain; he was succeeded by his brother Turgon. 

Morgoth scattered the remaining forces of the Sons of Fëanor, and in 495 Nargothrond was also overridden. Turgon had withdrawn to Gondolin which was kept hidden from both Morgoth and other Elves. In 510, Gondolin was betrayed by [[Maeglin]] and sacked. During the attack Turgon was killed; however, many of his people escaped and found their way south. Turgon was the last surviving male descendant of Fingolfin, so [[Gil-galad]], great-grandson of Finarfin, became the fourth and last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth.

Finally the Valar came down to Middle-earth and in the years 545-583 the [[War of Wrath]] was fought and Morgoth was cast into the Void. But Beleriand sank into the sea, except for a part of [[Ossiriand]] (Lindon), and a few isles. The defeat of Morgoth marked the end of the [[First Age]] and the start of the [[Second Age|Second]].

===The Second Age===
Most of the Noldor sailed back to Aman at the End of the First Age; but some, like [[Galadriel]] daughter of Finarfin or [[Celebrimbor]] grandson of Fëanor, refused the pardon of the Valar and remained in Middle-earth. Gil-galad founded a new kingdom at Lindon, and ruled throughout the Second Age, longer than any of the High Kings except for Finwë. But after a while [[Sauron]] had replaced his master Morgoth as the Dark Lord. With the aid of the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] he fortified [[Mordor]] and began the long war with the remaining Elves. He attacked Eregion, destroying it, but was withstood in [[Rivendell]] and Lindon. With the aid of the [[Númenóreans]], the Noldor managed to defeat him for a time.

However, in the year 3319 of the Second Age Númenor fell due to [[Ar-Pharazôn]]'s rebellion against the Valar, in which Sauron had a great part. When [[Elendil]] with his sons escaped to Middle-earth and established the realms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], Sauron tried to conquer Gondor before it could take root. Both Elendil and Gil-galad set out for Mordor in the [[Last Alliance]] of Men and Elves and defeated Sauron in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and finally in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]]. There Gil-galad perished, and so ended the High Kingship of the Noldor. Of the descendants of Finwë in Middle-earth, only Galadriel and [[Elrond]] Half-elven remained (and the Númenórean Kings through Elrond's twin brother [[Elros]]).

===The Third Age===
In the [[Third Age]], the Noldor in Middle-earth dwindled, and by the end of the Third Age the only big communities of Noldor remaining in Middle-earth were in Rivendell and Lindon. Their further fate of fading utterly from the World was shared by all Elves.

==Kings of the Noldor==
''See also: [[King of the Noldor]].

* In Valinor:
# [[Finwë]], first King.
# [[Fëanor]], first son of Finwë; claimed the title after his father's death.
# [[Finarfin]], third son of Finwë; ruled the Noldor remaining in Aman.

* In Middle-earth:
# [[Fingolfin]], second son of Finwë; held to be the [[High King of the Noldor]] by the majority of the Noldor after Maedhros son of Fëanor gave up his claims.
# [[Fingon]], first son of Fingolfin.
# [[Turgon]], second son of Fingolfin.
# [[Gil-galad]], great-grandson of Finarfin.

It is not known exactly how Finwë became King: he may have been a descendant of the Noldorin primogenitor [[Tata]], or simply have been accepted as leader based on his status as ambassador to the Valar. The Noldor had many princely houses besides that of Finwë: [[Glorfindel]] of Gondolin and [[Gwindor]] of Nargothrond, while not related to Finwë, were princes in their own right. These lesser houses held no realms, however: all the Noldorin realms of Beleriand and later Eriador were ruled by a descendant of Finwë.

The [[Men|Mannish]] descendants of [[Elros]] (the [[Kings of Arnor]]) called themselves High Kings, although their authority was only over the [[Dúnedain]]. As descendants through the female line Elros and his brother Elrond were not considered eligible, and Elrond indeed never claimed Kingship.

It is perhaps notable that Galadriel, the last of the House of Finwë in Middle-earth (other than the [[Half-elven]]) after the fall of Gil-galad, likewise never claimed a title, let alone that of High Queen. Indeed the only known Elven "kingdom" in Middle-earth after the Second Age was the [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] realm of Mirkwood, ruled by the Sinda [[Thranduil]].

==The House of Finwë==
The leaders of the Noldor were all members of the House of Finwë. The descendants of this house were also many of the major historical figures of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages, culminating in [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] and his wife [[Arwen]]. Below is a family tree showing the lines of descent from Finwë to the kings of Elves and [[Men]] in [[Middle-earth]] and [[Númenor]]. The names of the High Kings of the Noldor are in bold.

==Characteristics==
The Noldor were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the [[Vanyar]], a smaller group, and the [[Teleri]], a much larger one. The Noldor typically had grey eyes, fair skin, and dark hair, save for the members of the golden-haired [[House of Finarfin]].

However, the Noldor were the proudest of the Elves; in the words of the [[Sindar]], they came to Middle-earth because "they needed room to quarrel in". It was this pride that Melkor used to turn the Houses of [[House of Fëanor|Fëanor]] and [[House of Fingolfin|Fingolfin]] against each other. The pride of the Noldor also led to their [[Fall of the Noldor|Fall]] and [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]] (and their continued quarrels in Middle-earth, as noted by the Sindar).

Of the three clans of the [[Eldar]] they are also the people who most favors sword and shield as their weapons.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 215 footnote to §29</ref><ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 228 footnote to §49</ref>

==Etymology and Names==
The singular form of the [[Quenya]] noun is '''[[Noldo]]''' and the adjective is '''[[Noldorin]]'''.

''noldo'' is derived from the [[Elvish]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[NGOL]].<ref name=WJC>{{WJ|C}}, p. 383</ref>

The Noldor were called '''[[Golodhrim]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[ɡoˈloðrim]}}) or '''Gódhellim''' ({{IPA|[ɡoˈðelːim]}}) by [[Sindarin]]-speakers and '''Goldoi''' by [[Falmari]] of [[Tol Eressëa]]; they are also known as ''Deep Elves'' ("deep" as in "wise, learned").  Additionally, the Sindarin singular '''[[Golodh]]''' ({{IPA|[ˈɡoloð]}}) could be pluralized '''[[Golodhrim]]''', '''[[Gelydh]]''' ({{IPA|[ˈɡelyð]}}, later {{IPA|[ˈɡelið]}}) or more archaicly '''[[Gœlydh]]''' ({{IPA|[ˈɡølyð]}}).{{fact}}

The Noldor were known as the "'''Deep-elves'''".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref> Other names used for the Noldor included the Wise, the Golden, the Valiant, the Sword-elves, the Elves of the Earth, the Foes of Melkor, the Skilled of Hand, the Jewel-wrights, the Companions of Men, and the Followers of Finwë.<ref>{{HM|MR}}, p. 164</ref> It is also told that the Noldor were often called the Lispers by other native speakers of Quenya (such as the [[Vanyar]]), since they retained the medial "th" in their speech.<ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 34</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the early versions of Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium (see: ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''), the Noldor were most often called ''Noldoli'' or ''[[Gnomes]]''. They were still called Gnomes in early editions of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. They were also the ones who spoke the language that later became [[Sindarin]] (then called ''Gnomish'' or ''Noldorin'').

The spelling ''Ñoldor'' rather than ''Noldor'' was used by Tolkien in his later writings (the character ''ñ'' signifying the velar nasal, the sound found in the English word "si'''ng'''"), but even in earlier versions the name ''Ñoldo'' came from a [[Primitive Quendian]] stem *ñgolod&#333;, which led to Ñoldo in [[Quenya]] and ''Golodh'' in [[Sindarin]].

The family tree given above is correct in the placement of [[Orodreth]] and [[Gil-galad]]: Orodreth was [[Angrod]]'s son, and [[Gil-galad]] was Orodreth's son, thus the grandson of [[Angrod]] and great-grandson of [[Finarfin]], and brother to [[Finduilas]]. These are wrongly placed in the published ''Silmarillion''. (See Orodreth and Gil-galad articles for details). [[Argon]], the third son of [[Fingolfin]], does not appear in the published ''Silmarillion'' at all.
