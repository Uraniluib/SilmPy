'''Telumehtar''' ([[Quenya]] "Warrior of the Sky") is another name of the constellation [[Menelmacar]]. It is known in our world as [[Wikipedia:Orion| Orion]].

Behind this name lies an early story about a [[Valar|Vala]] named [[Telimektar]], son of [[Tulkas]], who apparently was converted into the constellation of Orion<ref>{{HM|LT1}}</ref>. Apart from the story of [[Telimektar]] there are two mentions of Telumehtar the Constellation:

# The name is quoted as an example of the pronunciation of the consonant /H/ with a reference to Orion, explained in a footnote: "usually called in [[Sindarin]] [[Menelvagor]], --- Q[uenya] Menelmacar".<ref>{{App|E1i}} (entry concerning the pronounciation of H)</ref>
# With the translation "''Warrior of the Sky''", as an older name for [[Menelmakil]], Orion.<ref>{{WJ|Author}} (Note 15, p. 411)</ref>
