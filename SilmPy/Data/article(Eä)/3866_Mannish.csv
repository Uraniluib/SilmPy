'''Mannish''' is a term used to refer to the languages of [[Men]], as opposed to the [[Elvish]] tongues, or those of the other races of [[Middle-earth]]. By far the most prominent Mannish language was [[Westron]].
==History==
Languages of Men started in [[Hildórien]]. When the [[Edain]] divided to migrate to the west. The groups that would eventually be known as [[House of Bëor]] and [[House of Hador|House of Marach]], used [[Taliska|one language]]. The third tribe, that would be later known as the [[House of Haleth]], used an unrelated tongue. 

During the march, the tribes left behind various descendants in [[Eriador]] who continued their languages. In [[Beleriand]] the House of Bëor quickly adopted [[Sindarin]]. However the language of Hador retained and was influenced by [[Khuzdul]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

The language of the [[House of Hador]] during the [[Second Age]] evolved into [[Adûnaic]].<ref>{{SD|Notion}}</ref> Meanwhile the descendants of the First Age in the Westlands became the [[Éothéod]] from whom ultimately derives the [[Rohan language|Rohirric]] language. The language of the House of Haleth also left descendants that were known as [[Pre-Númenórean]] languages.<ref name="Drú">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref><ref name="AppF"/>

Early Adûnaic mingled with many words of the languages of lesser men and became a Common Speech that spread thence along the coasts among all that had dealings with Westernesse<ref name="AppF">{{App|F}}</ref>. 

After the Downfall, the faithful considered Sindarin their mother tongue and used the Common Speech in their dealings with other folk and in the government of their wide realms; but they enlarged the language and enriched it with many words drawn from the Elven-tongues.<ref name="AppF"/>

==Translation==
Tolkien used real-life languages and names to present Mannish. The most known example is Westron, which is always replaced with modern English. 

This logic went one step further by also presenting all languages akin to Westron in languages related to English, so that their "understandability" by the protagonists is simulated to the English reader. Since English belongs to the Germanic family, most names Tolkien used are Germanic ([[Norse]], [[Gothic]], et cetera) with some Celtic exceptions. 

*Ancient names related to ''' [[Rhovanion]]''' (such as "[[Vidugavia]]") are '''[[Gothic]],'''' indicating a relationship to Dalish but not recognizable by Westron.
*'''[[Rohirric]]''', the language of the [[Rohirrim]] was replaced by '''[[Old English]]''', as Rohirric is an archaic relative of Westron, much as Anglo-Saxon is an archaic relative of English; 
*The '''[[Dalish]]''', the tongue of [[Dale]] (from which came the names of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]]), was translated into '''Old Norse''', a language related to Anglo-Saxon and modern English as Dalish was related to Rohirric and Westron; 
*The '''[[hobbitish]]''' names of the [[Stoors]], [[Buckland]] as well as some [[Bree-land]] names are '''[[Celtic]]'''; 

Mannish languages unrelated to Westron that sounded alien to the protagonists (such as [[Dunlendish]]), were left in their "genuine" form.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Men awoke as dumb creatures, and they were taught speech by [[Nuin]] the "Father of Speech", an Elf of the [[Hisildi]] who awoke them.<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>

In the 1930s ''[[The Tree of Tongues]]'', a schematic belonging to a later phase of the mythology, the "Tongues of Man" is derived from [[Lemberin]] ([[Avarin]]) and [[Khuzdul]], as in the later legendarium, but also from "[[Orcish]] languages".<ref>{{LR|P2V}}</ref>
