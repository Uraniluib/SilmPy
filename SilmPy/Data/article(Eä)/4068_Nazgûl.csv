The '''[[#Etymology|Nazgûl]]''' ([[Black Speech]]: '''Ringwraiths''', sometimes written '''''Ring-wraiths'''''), also known as the '''Nine Riders''' or '''Black Riders''' (or simply '''the Nine'''), were [[Sauron]]'s "most terrible servants" in [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Sometime during the [[Second Age]] (after year {{SA|1600}}<ref group=note>Sauron created the One Ring around this year, and later distributed the Nine Rings (cf. {{App|B}} and {{UT|Concerning}}).</ref>) Sauron gave [[Nine Rings|nine Rings of Power]] to powerful mortal [[Men]]. It is said that three of the Nine were lords of [[Númenor]] corrupted by Sauron,<ref name=Akallabeth>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> and one was a king among the [[Easterlings]].<ref name=Black/>

For many years the bearers used the rings to gain great wealth, prestige and power, becoming "''mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old''". The effect of the rings caused their lives to be prolonged, and to see things of the [[Unseen]]. But over time their bodily forms faded until they became [[wraiths]] entirely, slaves under the domination of Sauron's [[The One Ring|One Ring]].<ref name=Rings/>

Known as the Nazgûl, they first appeared around {{SA|2251}}<ref name=AppB1/> and were soon established as Sauron's principal servants. 

When Sauron was overthrown in {{SA|3441}} at the hands of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], the wraiths faded into the shadows.<ref name=AppB1>{{App|B1}}</ref> 

===Third Age===
However around {{TA|1050|n}} of the [[Third Age]] Sauron returned in the form of a shadow in [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]], triggering also the return of his servants. It was around {{TA|1300}} when the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] gathered evil [[Men]] and founded the Witch-kingdom of [[Angmar]]. From there he led Sauron's forces against the mannish kingdom of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1409}}. He was eventually defeated in battle in {{TA|1975}} and returned to [[Mordor]], gathering the other Nazgûl in preparation for the return of Sauron to that realm.<ref name=AppB2/> 

In {{TA|2000}}, they besieged [[Minas Ithil]] and captured it after a two-year siege. The city thereafter became the stronghold of the Nazgûl, from where they directed the rebuilding of Sauron's armies, also acquiring a ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' for the Dark Lord.<ref name=AppB2>{{App|B2}}</ref>
[[File:Ted_Nasmith_-_The_Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Nazgûl'']]
Indeed, after his defeat in [[Dol Guldur]], Sauron returned to Mordor in {{TA|2942}} and declared himself openly in {{TA|2951}}. Three of the Nazgûl were sent to his fortress at [[Dol Guldur]] to garrison that outpost.<ref name=AppB2/>

In {{TA|3017}} Sauron commanded the Ringwraiths to recover [[the One Ring]] of Power from "Baggins of the Shire". Disguised as horse riders clad in black (hence the term ''Black Riders''), they sought out [[Bilbo Baggins]] who, as [[Gollum]] had revealed, had the One Ring in his possession.

The [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] spoke of a rider who had come to offer Sauron's friendship and ask about [[Hobbits]].  As a token of their friendship he asked for a "trifle", a ring, "the least of rings", that the [[Bilbo Baggins|thief]] had stolen.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref><ref group=note>The identity of the messenger is unknown. In [[fandom]] it has been proposed that he was the [[Mouth of Sauron]]. [[Michael Martinez]] [http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/01/26/is-the-messenger-sent-to-dain-a-black-rider-or-the-mouth-of-sauron/ considers more possible] that it was a Nazgûl .</ref>

The Nazgûl at this point were dependent on their black horses (stolen from [[Rohan]]) for transportation. When they were swept away by the waters of the river [[Bruinen]], their horses were killed.  The Ringwraiths were forced to return to Mordor to regroup. They reappeared later mounted on [[Fell beasts|flying creatures]], at which point they were referred to as '''Winged Nazgûl'''.

By the conclusion of the [[War of the Ring]], all of the Nine Nazgûl were destroyed.  The [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] himself was slain by [[Éowyn]], the niece of King [[Théoden]] (with help from [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], known as "The Magnificent" thereafter) during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  The remaining eight Ringwraiths attacked the Army of the West during the last battle at the [[Black Gate]].  However, when [[Frodo Baggins]] put on the ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]], Sauron ordered the eight remaining Nazgûl to fly with all possible speed to Mount Doom to intercept Frodo. They arrived too late, with the Ring falling into the fire along with the hapless Gollum. The Nazgûl were caught in the firestorm of the erupting mountain and were destroyed.

== Powers and abilities ==

{{quote|The Nazgûl were they, the Ringwraiths, the Enemy's most terrible servants; darkness went with them, and they cried with the voices of death.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]"}}

Given form only through the attire of black cloaks and hauberks of silver mail, their original form was completely gone and invisible to mortal eyes. Their hypnotic eyes could be plainly distinguished from their dark clothing, and in a rage they appeared in a hellish fire. Mortal men could not touch them (unless blessed by weapons or tools of the ancient [[Elves]] of the [[First Age]] or by the [[Dúnedain]], such as the barrow-blade used by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] on the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]]). The Ringwraiths had many weapons, which included long swords of steel and flame, daggers with venomous properties, poisonous darts and black maces of great strength.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Attack of the Wraiths.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Attack of the Wraiths'']]
Their arsenal of deadly armaments was not confined to physical means; they also had seemingly magical weapons of devastating power. They were surrounded by an aura of terror, which affected all living creatures; their "breath" (called the ''[[Black Breath]]'') was poisonous, and their cries caused terror and despair in all who heard them. Some of the Nazgûl appear to have been accomplished sorcerers and used magic to devastating effect. According to Tolkien, though, it was the fear they inspired that was the chief danger:
{{quote|They have no great physical power against the fearless," he wrote, "but what they have, and the fear that they inspire, is enormously increased in darkness|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}

The Nazgûl existed mostly in the wraith world (the [[Unseen]]), making them extremely difficult to harm.  Ordinary weapons would not hurt them, and even weapons of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] manufacture would be destroyed if they passed through the wraith forms of the Nazgûl.  They could not, however, interact normally with the material world (the [[Seen]]): they needed garments and weapons provided by Sauron to give them form.  Consequently, they could be defeated by attacks that destroyed their disguises, forcing them to return to [[Sauron]] to receive new ones.

The Nazgûl spread terror in mortal creatures merely by their presence.  Only specially trained horses or the [[fell beasts]] of [[Mordor]] could bear them.  They caused panic and despair in their enemies simply by flying overhead, and only individuals of great courage could face them in combat.

They were also poisonous to mortal beings, causing a condition known as the [[Black Breath]].  Merely being in the vicinity of one of them could cause disorientation and illness.  Intense exposure could be lethal.

The Nazgûl had poor vision in the material world, but they were acutely aware of the beings with a presence in the wraith world, like the wearer of [[the One Ring]] and certain Elves, such as Glorfindel.  Anyone who could see into the wraith world could see the Nazgûl as they had appeared in their mortal lives.

The [[Witch-king]] could also affect matter with his voice, shattering the dagger that Frodo had gotten in the [[Barrow-downs]] and weakening the gates of [[Minas Tirith]].  Whether other Nazgûl could perform similar feats is unknown.

== Identities ==

Only a few of the Nazgûl are named or identified individually. Their leader was the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]], and his second in command was named [[Khamûl]]. Khamûl was a lord of [[Easterlings]],<ref name=Black>{{UT|Black}}</ref> and was the only Nazgûl known by his name. Three of them were [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=Akallabeth/> 

==Etymology==

''Nazgûl'' means "ringwraiths" in the [[Black Speech]] (consisting of ''[[nazg]]'' + ''[[gûl]]'').<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 31, 79, 125</ref>

== Other names and titles ==

Among their many names and titles were: the Ringwraiths, the Black Riders, the Fell Riders, the Nine Riders, the Black Wings, the Shadows, the Nine, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings, and the Shriekers.

An [[Elvish]] name given for the Ringwraiths is '''''Úlairi'''''.<ref name=Rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 153 (§30)</ref> Linguists have remarked that it is a [[Quenya]] plural name of unknown meaning and etymology.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=25 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]''</ref> [[Michael Martinez]], analysing the word, has tentatively suggested that: 

{{blockquote| ''Úlairi'' is a compound formed from ''Ú'' + ''lai'' + ''ri'' with probable meaning of "un (bad or immoral)" + "shadow" + "ones". In other words, the name may mean something like "those who are in/of unnatural shadow".|<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2014/08/15/what-is-the-literal-translation-of-ulairi/|articlename=What is the Literal Translation of Úlairi?|dated=15 August 2014|website=[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/ middle-earth.xenite.org]|accessed=16 August 2014}}</ref>}}

:A new Ringwraith is introduced in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. Morgomir is the "Lieutenant of Carn-Dûm", the right-hand man of the Witch-king, of [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] descent. The design is similar to that in [[Peter Jackson]]'s films: he is hooded and cloaked when he works for the [[Mordor]] faction, and white and ghostly when he fights for Angmar.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl appear throughout the game. Three are Easterlings: "The Bane of Rhûn", "The Woe of Khand", and "The Cursed Rider"; three are [[Haradrim]]: "The Grim Southron", "The High Sorcerer of Harad", and "The Forsaken Reaver"; and three are of Númenórean origin: "The Black Blade of Lebennin", "The Gloom of Nurn", and the Witch-king of Angmar. The Nazgûl are also given the [[Sindarin]] name "Gwatharan" (pl. "Gwetherain").

:Early in the game one of the Nine wounds a [[Dúnedain]] Ranger Amdir with a [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]], who is later transformed into a Wraith himself, despite the best efforts of Free Peoples. Later, the player attempts to resist the troubles the Nine are spreading in Bree-Land. During the Fellowship's stay in [[Lothlórien]], the [[Galadhrim]] Elves launch a military strike against [[Dol Guldur]], to draw the attention of the Eye from the company departing down the Shores of Anduin. During their travel down the waters of the Great River, Legolas shot and killed a fell shadow in the sky, not knowing it to be a Nazgûl. The player is later able to find the corpse of the fell beast in the [[Brown Lands]] and it becomes clear that a Nazgûl is not far. At night, the Wraith ambushes the player who manages to drive him away with the use of fire. 

:During the Battle of the Pelennor, the Witch-king plays the role as described in the books. The High Sorcerer of Harad and the Woe of Khand guard the way to Gothmog in the raid instance "Throne of the Dread Terror", and the Forsaken Reaver is found at the end of the "Quays of the [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]] instance, in which he attempts to prevent Aragorn and his host from joining the battle.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:In the Evil Campaign, the Eight Nazgûl bring Witch-King back to life after Sauron reclaims The One Ring.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl appear in a flasback during the prologue of the game, in which they attack the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] at [[Sarn Ford]], the entrance of [[the Shire]]. Later in the flashback their leader, the [[Witch-king]], speaks with [[Agandaûr]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series) ]]:'''
:In the context of the film adaptation, the Witch-king and the other Ringwraiths were buried in a dungeon in the [[High Fells of Rhudaur]] after the [[Battle of Fornost|fall]] of Angmar. The Witch-king of Angmar initially appears in Dol Guldur, where he briefly fights [[Radagast]] (who also discovers a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] within the fortress) with his Morgul-blade. He drops it and Radagast takes it with him, ultimately bringing it to [[Gandalf]], who then shows to the [[White Council]] in [[Rivendell]]. Later, Gandalf, per Galadriel's advice, visits the High Fells dungeons and discovers that they had been brought back to life, as their cells were empty, broken open from the inside. Through this investigation, he is convinced that the Necromancer is indeed Sauron.

:During the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]] they appeared in armored, ghostly versions of their mortal forms after Galadriel rescues Gandalf From his cage in Dol Guldur. The Nine do battle with Galadriel, [[Saruman]], and Elrond. During a confrontation between Galadriel and Sauron, they are driven to Mordor, with their master eventually following suit.
