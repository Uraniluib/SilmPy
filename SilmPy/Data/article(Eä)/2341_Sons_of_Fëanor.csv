The '''Sons of Fëanor''' were the seven [[Noldor|Noldorin]] [[Elves]] [[Maedhros]], [[Maglor]], [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]], [[Curufin]], [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]]. They took the [[Oath of Fëanor]] with their father, and pursued it after his death in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]]. They held lands in [[East Beleriand]], with Maedhros and Maglor holding the immediate passes south of [[Lothlann]], and the other brothers ruling lands behind their guard to the south.  Their [[Sindarin]] names are the ones usually given.

==History==
[[Fëanor]]'s sons were in general allied with the other [[Elves of Beleriand]] against the power of [[Morgoth]]. After the recovery of one of the [[Great Jewels]] by [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], however, the Oath of their father came into action, and they fell upon the other Elves in hope of retrieving the Silmaril. They attacked [[Dior]] in [[Doriath]], and the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], but neither of these forays gained them the [[Silmarils|Jewel]]; it was borne into the West by [[Eärendil]].

At the time of the [[War of Wrath]], only two of the seven sons remained, Maedhros and Maglor. They stole the last two Silmarils from the camp of [[Eönwë]], but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the hallowed Jewels rejected their claimants. Maedhros in anguish threw himself into a fiery fissure, and Maglor in despair cast his Jewel into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].

#'''[[Maedhros]] the Tall''' - his [[father-name]] was ''[[Nelyafinwë]]'' ("Finwë the Third") and his [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Maitimo]]'' ("Well-shaped One"). He gave up the High Kingship because of his rescue by [[Fingon]] son of [[Fingolfin]].
#'''[[Maglor]] the Minstrel''' - his father-name was ''Kanafinwë'' ("Strong-voiced [of] Finwë") and his mother-name was ''[[Makalaurë]]'' ("Forging Gold" meant in the poetic sense).
#'''[[Celegorm]] the Fair''' - his father-name was ''[[Turcafinwë]]'' ("Strong Bodied [of] Finwë") and his mother-name was ''[[Tyelcormo]]'' ("Hasty-Riser").
#'''[[Caranthir]] the Dark''' - his father-name was ''[[Morifinwë]]'' ("Dark[-haired of] Finwë") because of his dark hair, and his mother name was ''[[Carnistir]]'' ("Red-faced") because of his ruddy complexion.
#'''[[Curufin]] the Crafty''' - his father-name was ''[[Curufinwë]]'' ("Skillful [son of] Finwë"), the same name as Fëanor.  His mother-name was ''Atarinkë'' ("Little Father"). He was the father of [[Celebrimbor]], maker of the [[Rings of Power]].
#'''[[Amrod]]''' - his father-name was ''[[Pityafinwë]]'' ("Little [son of] Finwë") and his mother name was ''[[Ambarussa]]'' ("Top-russet").
#'''[[Amras]]''' - his father-name was ''[[Telufinwë]]'' ("Last [of] Finwë") and though his mother-name was originally ''[[Ambarussa]]'', his father insisted on naming him seperately. His mother gave him the name ''[[Umbarto]]'' ("The Fated"), but Fëanor changed it to ''[[Ambarto]]'' ("Upwards-exalted"), disturbed with the ominous name.
