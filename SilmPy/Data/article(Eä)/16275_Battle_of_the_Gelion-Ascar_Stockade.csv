The '''Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade''' was a battle fought about {{FA|375}} between the forces of [[Morgoth]] and the [[Haladin]] and later the [[Noldor]] under [[Caranthir]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>

== History ==
===Prelude===
During the [[Long Peace]] the [[Secondborn]] began crossing over [[Ered Lindon]] and into [[Beleriand]] where they have been making contact with the [[Eldar]] living there. One group of these Men were the [[Haladin]] that dwelt in [[Thargelion]] after unfriendly meetings with the [[Green-elves]].

[[Morgoth]] endeavoured to do as much harm to Men as possible and sent an Orc-raid passing East escaping the leaguer, crossing Ered Lindon and back through the [[Dwarf-road]] in stealth. They entered into the southern woods of Caranthir’s land and fell upon the Haladin.

===The Battle===
The Haladin at the time dwelt in homesteads far apart each other and were slow to unite to defend themselves. Among the men there was one named Haldad, ‘who was masterful and fearless’ gathered all the strong men retreated between the [[Ascar]] and [[Gelion]] and built a [[Gelion-Ascar Stockade|stockade]] across them and led all his people that he could gather behind them. The Orcs continued to attack the Haladin and besieged the stockade.

[[Haldad]] led a sortie against the Orcs and here he was slain along with his son [[Haldar]] who rushed out to save his father’s body from the Orcs. Haldad had a daughter named [[Haleth]] and like her father and her twin brother she was valiant and brave and she led the defence of the stockade.

The Haladin were without hope and some cast themselves in the rivers hoping to escape but drowned in the attempt. After seven days the Orcs prepared for their final assault on the stockade until the music of trumpets were heard. Caranthir arrived with a Noldorin host from the North and attacked the Orcs driving many of them to the rivers.

===Aftermath===
The Orc-raid was routed and Caranthir seeing the valour of the Men and the potential as allies offered Haleth and the Haladin land and protection further in the north. However Haleth refused as she was proud and unwilling to be guided or ruled. The Haladin were like minded so they gathered all what remained of their goods and people whom were lost they left the shadow of the mountains going west.

Haleth was chosen as their chief and there people were now known as the [[House of Haleth]].
