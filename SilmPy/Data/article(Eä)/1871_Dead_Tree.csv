The '''Dead Tree''' ({{TA|1640}} - {{TA|2872|n}}; the [[wikipedia:Snag_(ecology)|snag]] stood [[Third Age 3019|for 147 years]]) was planted by King [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]]. It was the third and last [[White Tree of Gondor]]. It died at the same time as [[Belecthor II]] the twenty-first [[Ruling Steward]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

For lack of a seedling, the Dead Tree was left standing in the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] of [[Minas Tirith]] "until the King comes".<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref>. It stood throughout the following centuries and the [[War of the Ring]]. That was until King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]] found a new seedling on [[Mindolluin|Mount Mindolluin]] in 3019.

When it was replaced, it was removed from the court but was placed in the [[Rath Dínen|Tombs of the Kings]] with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen [[Kings of Gondor|monarch]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
