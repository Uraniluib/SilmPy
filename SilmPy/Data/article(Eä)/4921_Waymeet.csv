'''Waymeet''' or '''Waymoot''' was a town in the [[Westfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].  The [[East Road]], the main road through the Shire, ran through the town on its way to [[Michel Delving]].  Two smaller roads also led to Waymeet: one from [[Little Delving]] to the north and one from [[Tookland]] and the [[Southfarthing]] beyond.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  Where these roadways came together, a town had grown up, appropriately known as Waymeet.

==History==
In the [[War of the Ring]], the ruffians who took over the Shire had a staging post or barracks in Waymeet,<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref> and it was from here that [[Sharkey's Men]] set out for the [[Battle of Bywater]], in which they were soundly defeated by the [[Shire-hobbits]]. 

==Etymology==
The name refers to the village being at the meeting of three ways.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 778</ref> 

The name ''Waymeet'' is a modernised spelling of the older form, [[Waymoot]], which was the spelling preferred by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in early drafts of ''[[The Return of the King]]''. Though he ultimately modernised the name within the book itself, the map of the Shire in the prologue of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] '' was never corrected, and still carries the older spelling of the name.<ref name="RC">[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 660</ref>
