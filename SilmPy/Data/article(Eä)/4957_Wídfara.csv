'''Wídfara''' was a man of Rohan during the [[War of the Ring]].
==History==
His home was in [[the Wold]], the wild grasslands of [[Rohan]]'s northern border, and in these northern lands he had acquired a special weather-sense. He followed [[Théoden]] to [[Minas Tirith]] and it was he who first reported a change in the wind during the long ride, a change that augured the end of [[Sauron]]'s looming darkness.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> He fought in the ensuing [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Widfara"</ref>

==Etymology==
''Wídfara'' is [[Old English]] for "far, wide traveller".
