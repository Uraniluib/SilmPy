'''The Wold''' was the northernmost and least populated part of [[Rohan]], a grassy upland plain lying between [[Fangorn Forest]] and the [[Anduin]], bordered to the north by the [[Limlight]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
Prior to the late years of the [[Second Age]] the Wold was part of no kingdom; the [[Elves]] of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] never claimed any land south of the [[Limlight]] as part of their realm.<ref>{{UT|6c}}</ref> When the kingdom of [[Gondor]] was established in {{SA|3320}},<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> the Wold became part of [[Calenardhon]].

After victory in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], [[Isildur]], his nephew [[Meneldil]], and a company of trusted friends rode about the borders of Gondor. The Wold was one of their last stops before they journeyed to [[Amon Anwar]] where the tomb of [[Elendil]] was made.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iv) ''The Tradition of Isildur''</ref>

In {{TA|2510}} the Wold was invaded by a host of the [[Balchoth]] who crossed over the [[Anduin]] from the [[Brown Lands]]. At the same time Orcs descended upon the Wold from the [[Misty Mountains]] in the west. The [[Ruling Steward]] [[Cirion]] sent messengers north to seek aid and then led Gondor's northern army to repel the invaders. This army had been driven into the [[Field of Celebrant]] and was facing annihilation when [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]] and his mounted host burst upon the rear of the enemy. The invaders fled across the Limlight and were hunted by Eorl's riders across the Wold.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

It was after that victory when Calenardhon, including the Wold, was given to Eorl's people and became an independent kingdom. However, in {{TA|2545|n}} [[Easterlings]] once more attempted to invade the area and King [[Eorl]] of the [[Rohirrim]] fell in battle in the Wold.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

The main inhabitants were nomadic Men of Rohan who used the land to graze cattle, although during the years up to the [[War of the Ring]] the land had become deserted due to [[Orcs|orc-raids]].<ref name="River">{{FR|II9}}</ref>

In [[July]] {{TA|3018|n}} the [[Nazgûl]] passed northward across the Wold as they began searching for the land of the [[Hobbits]]. They returned to the Wold in [[September]] empty-handed, where they met messengers from Sauron with orders to ride in haste to [[Isengard]].<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, (i) ''On the Journey of the Black Riders according to the account that Gandalf gave to Frodo''</ref>

In [[February]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] passed by the eastern edge of the Wold as they coursed down the [[Anduin]].<ref name="River"/> Later that month the Fellowship was broken and first the [[Uruk-hai]], who had captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]],<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref> followed by the [[Three Hunters]], skirted the western edge of the Wold as they raced towards Fangorn Forest. It was here that [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] met [[Éomer]], who was riding back after destroying the Orcs who had crossed the northern plains of Rohan.<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>

The Wold was invaded from the north by forces from [[Dol Guldur]] on [[11 March]], {{TA|3019|n}}. These invaders were destroyed upon the Wold by the [[Ents]] on [[12 March]].<ref name="TA"/>
