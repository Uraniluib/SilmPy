The '''North Moors''' lay along the northern border of [[the Shire]] in the [[Northfarthing]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  It was the one place within the Shire where heavy snowfalls were common.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>  

Around the spring of {{TA|3018}}, [[Halfast Gamgee]] reported seeing [[Ents|Tree-men]] or [[giants]] away beyond the North Moors.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
Assuming that Halfast's story is not a fanciful fabrication and indeed he saw something strange, [[fandom|fans]] have connected the "tree-man" to the [[Ents]] (or [[Entwives]]) that appear later in the story. However [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] specifically mentioned that he had not invented the Ents before the moment he reached the chapter ''[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]''<ref>{{L|231}}</ref> and the "tree-man" reference was written before it.<ref>{{HM|RS}}, pp. 253-254</ref> It is unknown whether Tolkien himself consciously considered such a connection or if he revisited the matter subsequently.<ref>{{webcite|author=WDBL, Paul Adams, Mark Gordon|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/tfaq/EnemyMisc.html#Entwives|articlename=What became of the Entwives?|dated=|website=[[Tolkien FAQ]]|accessed=}}</ref>
