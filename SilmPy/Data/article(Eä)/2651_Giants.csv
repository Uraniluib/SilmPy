'''Giants''' were one of the mysterious [[:Portal:Characters|races]] of [[Middle-earth]], mentioned only fleetingly.

==History==
Giants are beings shrouded in mystery. [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] was known for telling stories about [[dragons]] and [[Orcs|goblins]] and giants<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] had heard of giants in tales,<ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref> but none of these tales survive and the origin and history of the giants is obscure.<ref name="Giants">{{HH|IV}}, "(iii): The Giants", pp. 143-5</ref>

A local legend among the [[Pre-Númenóreans|indigenous people]] of [[Gondor]] told of giants making the [[White Mountains]], to keep [[Men]] out of their lands by the [[Belegaer|Sea]]. One of them, [[Tarlang]], tripped, and broke his neck. The other giants did not clean up his body, which became incorporated in the land instead. The giant's neck became [[Tarlang's Neck]], his head [[Dol Tarlang]], and the stones he was carrying [[Cûl Veleg]] and [[Cûl Bîn]].<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 536-7</ref>

The [[Ettenmoors]] owed their name to some gigantic creatures of that land, although these were perhaps merely some kind of [[trolls]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 183</ref><ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>

The ''stone-giants'' lived in the Misty Mountains during the late [[Third Age]]. Upon coming, they drove out the majority of the [[bears]] that lived there.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> They found a sport in throwing rocks at each other, and then into the depths below them to hear them shatter among the trees.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>

Presumably, not all giants were evil, as Gandalf hoped to convince a more or less decent giant to block the [[Front Porch]] to [[Goblin-town]] at the top of the [[High Pass]] in the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{H|6}}</ref>

==Fandom==
Giants are notable for being definitely mentioned in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as actual creatures of the mythological setting, yet appearing nowhere else among the creatures and races of [[Arda]], nor participating in any of the wars. The [[Valaquenta]] doesn't mention them, nor do they appear in the wars of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', neither does [[Sauron]] use them in the [[War of the Ring]].

This led some [[Tolkienists]] to assume that giants are maybe a fleeting idea of Tolkien that perhaps should not be considered [[canon]]ical. [[Robert Foster]] comments that the ''stone-giants'' "may be no more serious than [[Golfimbul]]".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 366</ref>

Other theories attempt to include the giants among the known races of Arda. For example they might be a large race of [[Men]] (like [[Hobbits]] are a small race of Men), or [[Trolls]], or simply "nature [[Spirit (disambiguation)|spirits]]" more or less like [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Steuard Jensen|website=Tolkien meta-FAQ|articlename=What were the giants?|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/Creatures.html#Giants}}</ref> Furthermore, Douglas A. Anderson's annotations in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition]]'' express the opinion that stone-giants are a variety of troll.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 104</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Before ''The Hobbit''===
Giants originally had a larger part in the [[legendarium]]. In one early manuscript, the giants are counted among the [[úvanimo|Úvanimor]], servants of [[Morgoth|Melko]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref> In another manuscript, the giants are counted among the [[Earthlings]], and are divided between the "wood-giants" ([[Qenya]] ''ulbandi'') and "mountainous-giants" (Qenya ''taulir'').<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 9</ref> And in other early writings, two giants are named: [[Nan (Giant)|Nan]] (said to be like an [[Elms|Elm]]-tree) and [[Gilim]] (whose name is [[Gnomish]] for "winter").<ref>{{LB|C5}} (verse 1497)</ref><ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>.

It is quite possible that their appearance in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' is a relic from this early phase of the legendarium. [[John D. Rateliff]] has argued that they might have become "free agents"; not wicked, but simply not aware of their surroundings.<ref name="Giants"/>

===Other names and etymologies===
An early [[Sundocarmë|root]] for "giant" is given as [[NOROTH]]. This yields [[Quenya]] ''[[norsa]]'',<ref name="NOROTH">{{LR|Etymologies}} (cf. [[Sundocarmë|Root]] ''[[NOROTH]]'')</ref> and ''Noroth'' (likely supposed to be a [[Noldorin]] word<ref>{{webcite|author=Roman Rausch|articleurl=http://sindanorie.lima-city.de/RS&TI&WR.htm|articlename=''Essekenta Endamarwa'' - Names from ''The Return of the Shadow'', ''The Treason of Isengard'' and ''The War of the Ring''|dated=23 December 2006|website=Sindanórie|accessed=8 October 2011}}</ref>). A discarded Quenya word was ''hanako'', from a root KHAN-AK.<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 21</ref>


===Giants and Ents===
Giants were the wicked precursors of [[Ents]]. The elm-like features of the Giant Nan, and that in early versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' it was the Giant [[Treebeard]] who held [[Gandalf]] captive, not [[Saruman]],<ref>{{RS|3XXI}}</ref> makes the connection between Giants and Ents within [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s imagination clear.<ref name="Giants"/> "Ent" comes from an [[Old English]] word for "giant",<ref>{{RS|1XId}}</ref> seen at various points in ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', for example line 2717, ''enta geweorc'', "the work of giants".<ref>Howell D. Chickering, Jr., "Beowulf: A Dual Language Edition", pp. 212-3</ref>

==Inspiration==
In Germanic mythology names for the giants were ''jotun'' ([[Norse]]) and ''eoten'' ([[Old English]]). From the latter word Tolkien derived the name "[[Ent]]".

In the ''[[The Return of the King|Return of the King]]'' it is noted that [[Minas Tirith]] "''seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth''".<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] have suggested that this notion derives from [[Old English]] mythology, in which giants were often portrayed as builders of ancient structures.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 514</ref>

==Other fiction==
A [[The Giant|giant]] troubles [[Farmer Giles]]' land, who chases him off with his blunderbuss.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>
