'''Arassuil''' ({{TA|2719}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2784|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 156) was the eleventh [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], succeeding his father, [[Arahad II]], when he died in 2719.

==History==
During his chieftainship the [[Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] became more bold, daring to invade [[Eriador]]. The [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] fought many battles trying to hold them back,<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> but one party of [[Orcs]] managed to reach [[the Shire]], where they were fought off by a party of brave [[Hobbits]] under [[Bandobras Took|Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took]] in {{TA|2747|n}} at the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Also during this time, in {{TA|2758|n}}, the [[Long Winter]] arrived. Many lives were lost, and [[Gandalf]] and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] had to help the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] survive.<ref name="TA"/>

After having been chieftain for 65 years, Arassuil died in 2784. He was succeeded by his son, [[Arathorn I]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Arassuil's name is [[Sindarin]], however, the etymology of it is a bit uncertain. It could be from ''[[aran]]'' meaning "king", and ''[[suil]]'' meaning "greeting".
