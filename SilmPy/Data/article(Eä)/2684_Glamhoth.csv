__NOTOC__
'''''Glamhoth''''' is a [[Sindarin]] word for [[Orcs]]. Literally, it means "the dinhorde, the yelling horde", and is a descriptive term referring to the loud and barbarous speech of the Orcs.<ref name=UT/>

==Etymology==
The first part, ''glam'', means "barbaric speech", and is an expansion of ''[[lam]]'', "tongue, language". An individual within the group is referred to as a ''glamog'', and ''glam'' appears in [[Glamdring]]. The second element, ''[[hoth]]'' is a common suffix to denote a collection of people. 

==Phrases==
*"''[[Gurth]] [[an]] '''Glamhoth'''!''" (Death to the Orcs!)<ref name=UT>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

==Commentary==
Throughout history, populations have always considered the languages of other peoples inferior, or uncouth to the ears. The term [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian "Barbarian"] originally meant "brabbler". Similarly, Germany is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_Germany "Land of the Mute"], "land of those who do not speak our tongue" in some Slavic countries. A similar pattern is found in [[Adûnaic]], where the word for "shout" (''rûkh'') is related to the words for "Orc", ''[[uruk]]''.
