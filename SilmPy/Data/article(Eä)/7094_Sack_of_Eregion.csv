The '''Sack of Eregion''' was the campaign in which [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]] to find the three Elven Rings of power or to find out where they are by torture. He also scattered the [[Elves]] that lived there.

==Background==
Sauron first came to [[Ost-in-Edhil]] around {{SA|1200}} disguised as an emissary of the [[Valar]] offering his knowledge to [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]. He was called [[Annatar]], Lord of the Gifts. Annatar taught Gwaith-i-Mírdain the craft of making [[Rings of Power]]. Based on the knowledge gained from Annatar, [[Celebrimbor]] created the [[Three Rings]]: [[Vilya]], [[Narya]] and [[Nenya]].

However, Sauron secretly forged [[the One Ring]] in [[Orodruin]], the mountain of [[Mordor]]. Celebrimbor sent the Three away for safekeeping - Vilya and Narya to [[Gil-galad]], and Nenya to [[Galadriel]] - and then prepared for war.

==Opposing Forces==
Sauron commanded a great host of evil men, orcs, and other creatures. No number can be certain, but considering the time it likely was a force of many tens of thousands. Enough to be able to challenge and destroy not just Hollin, but the great kingdoms of Lindon and Khazad-dûm.

As with Sauron's forces it cannot be certain the number of troops the Elves or Dwarves deployed. However it can be speculated that there were at least several thousand Elves, and several thousand Dwarves; whose inhabitants in Khazad-dûm were at their height.

==The Battle==
[[Sauron]] marched through [[Eriador]] until he came to [[Ost-in-Edhil]]. He sacked the city and took [[Celebrimbor]] prisoner.

==Aftermath==
