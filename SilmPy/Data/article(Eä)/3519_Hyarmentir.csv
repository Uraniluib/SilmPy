'''Hyarmentir''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[çarˈmentir]}}) was a mighty mountain to the south and east of [[Valinor]], perhaps of the [[Pelóri]].<ref name=guide/><ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> It was one of the tallest in [[Aman]], but not as [[Taniquetil]] to the north, which was the tallest of the world. 

[[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]] climbed it, as Ungoliant wrought her webs between clefts and pinnacles. From its summit, they looked out over the Tree-lit land of the [[Valar]], before they descended Hyarmentir's long, shallow western slopes and set out to destroy the [[light of Valinor|light]] of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{S|8}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Hyarmentir'' is [[Quenya]]. The first element in the name is ''[[hyarmen]]'' ("south").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> The second element is likely ''[[tir]]'' ("watch").

It probably means "south-watch".<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Hyarmentir"</ref>
