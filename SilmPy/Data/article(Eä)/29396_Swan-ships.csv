The '''Swan-ships''' were [[Elves|Elven]] ships crafted to resemble [[swans]].
==The Teleri==

"''...the Haven of the Swans, lit with many lamps. For that was their city, and the haven of their ships; and those were made in the likeness of swans, with beaks of gold and eyes of gold and jet.''"<ref>{{S|5}}</ref>

==Lothlórien==

The Elves of [[Lothlórien]] built a "''swan-shaped barge''", having a "''curved neck, and jewelled eyes, and half-raised wings''".<ref name=TI>{{HM|TI}}, "Farewell to Lórien", p. 279</ref>

"''...sailing proudly down the stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang.''"<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

==Other versions of the [[Legendarium]]==

In the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One|The Book of Lost Tales]]'', [[Aulë]] seems to have been the first to make "''great vessels like to the bodies of swans''".<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|V}}, p. 124</ref>

A detail left out from the description of the swan-boat of Lothlórien in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (either out of space constraints, literary considerations, or because the idea was abandoned), has been provided by [[Christopher Tolkien]]:

"''Two elves, clad in white, steered it with black paddles so contrived that the blades folded back, as a swan's foot does, when they were thrust forward in the water.''"<ref name=TI/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:A swan-ship can be seen along the banks of [[Celebrant]], a small river running from [[Mirrormere]] to [[Anduin]], near the tributary to Anduin in [[Lothlórien]].
