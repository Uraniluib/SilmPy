The '''Deeping-stream''' rose in the gorge of the [[White Mountains]] known as [[Helm's Deep]]. It flowed through a culvert in the wall that guarded that refuge of the [[Rohirrim]], and then around the feet of the rock where the [[Hornburg]] stood, before beginning its journey into the wide lands of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>
