'''Cermië''' ([[Cerveth]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the seventh month of the year in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] of [[Gondor]], following [[Loëndë]], and preceding [[Úrimë]]. In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the fourth month of the year, immediately following [[Nárië]].

''Cermië'' in the Kings' Reckoning and in the Stewards' Reckoning corresponded, for the most part, to [[Afterlithe]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[24 June]] through [[23 July]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
