'''Shelob''' was a great spider-like creature akin to those of [[Nan Dungortheb]] in [[Beleriand]], the last offspring of the demonic [[Ungoliant]].

==History== 
Shelob was born during the [[Elder Days]], to the spider-like demon Ungoliant, who mated with (and devoured) the spider-creatures of the [[Ered Gorgoroth]]. She dwelt for many years in [[Nan Dungortheb]] with her countless brothers and sisters, even after Ungoliant ventured elsewhere.

Shelob fled from ruin (apparently the [[War of Wrath]]) and established her lair high in the mountains of [[Mordor]] at least in the first centuries of the [[Second Age]], before [[Sauron]] claimed that land as his own. She mated with her offspring which she slew, and her descendants were to be seen in [[Ephel DÃºath]] and [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=lair>{{TT|Lair}}</ref><ref name=guide/> 

Shelob fed off all living things, such as [[Elves]] and [[Men]], but as these became scarce in the area, she fed upon [[orcs]].<ref name=lair/> Sauron would sometimes send her captured prisoners for whom he had no further use and amuse himself watching how she played with her prey. Even though they did not communicate, Sauron and Shelob understood each other. She served as a secure guardian of the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] to prevent any intruders from entering the dark land.

While looking for [[the One Ring]], [[Gollum]] was trapped by her, but he managed somehow to communicate with her and promised to bring her more food if she released him. Indeed, Gollum (whom the orcs of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] call "Shelob's Sneak") brought [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] near her Lair while seeking [[Mount Doom]].

While put off by the [[Phial of Galadriel]] in the tunnels, she intercepted them again outside and attacked Frodo, stinging him into a death-like coma. Sam managed to defeat her by letting her impale herself upon [[Sting]] when she tried to crush him under her massive body and using all power of the Phial of Galadriel to blind her. Wounded, she fled to her lair and was not seen for the remainder of Lord of the Rings.

Thinking Frodo dead, Sam took the One Ring from him and left his body behind, but discovered later that Shelob's venom was not intended to kill its victims but only to render them unconscious and keep their meat fresh.

Shelob may have eventually died of starvation caused by her inability to hunt while blind.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 353, entry "Shelob"</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Shelob'' is derived from "lob", an archaic English word for spider. A variation, "cob" is the derivation of the word "cobweb".  The first element, "she", simply mentions the spider's gender.<ref>{{L|70}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] mistakenly classified the name as [[Sindarin]], failing to provide a translation.<ref name=guide/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Shelob was voiced by [[Jenny Lee]].  Lee had no dialogue, but hissed to convey Shelob's menace, then made a bubbling noise to suggest the passing of her poison into Frodo.  Finally, she made a roaring sound during her fight with Sam to convey her pain when Sam's thrusts found their mark. 

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Shelob's face.jpg|thumb|right|Shelob's face from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]].]]
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''

:Shelob can be seen to have a retractable venomous sting at the rear end between the spinnerets, resembling a wasp's sting. This is very much unlike real spiders which inject venom with their fangs but accurate relative to the novel. Shelob also appears to have a gaping mouth, whereas real spiders can ingest only liquid.

:In the book, on the other hand, "clusters" of eyes are mentioned, which may suggest compound eyes like those of insects; the Shelob in the movie does ''not'' have compound eyes, which is appropriate. A hunting spider of the family [[wikipedia:Lycosidae|Lycosidae]],{{fact}} which Shelob most closely resembles, would have two large eyes facing forward, and a few smaller ones almost hidden below. The only spiders that can reasonably be said to have "clustered" eyes (though not true compound eyes) are the daddy long-legs spiders of the family Pholcidae, but Shelob does not resemble these rather spindly and fragile spiders in other aspects of her physique.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'''''
:Shelob is a playable hero for the Goblins faction, and appears in the fifth level of the Evil Campaign, "Mirkwood", where she has apparently joined the [[Mouth of Sauron]] on his mission to take the [[Old Forest Road]]. During the level, Shelob can be used to recruit the Spiders of Mirkwood, as they are her children, and will obey her if she is sent to their nest. She also appears during the final mission, "Rivendell", alongside the other villains.

'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'''''
:Though unseen, Shelob is identified in the Appendices as the mother of the Ungol spiders that are encountered throughout Mordor. She is also referred to as the Spider Queen, a title that wasn't given to her in the book. An artefact, a "Crushed Ungol Egg", shows that Shelob initially lived in Mordor itself with Sauron and his servants, until it became apparent that Shelob would disobey Sauron, so he banished her to the pass of Cirith Ungol, and forbade her from laying any more eggs on his land. According to the "Ungol" article in the Appendices, Shelob has taken an interest in the recent events occurring in Mordor, though it is unclear to what extent. 

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'''''
:Shelob is voiced by Pollyanna McIntosh, and plays a prominent role early in the game. This portrayal of Shelob is unique in that she is able to assume a fair form, as a raven-haired woman in a black dress. She can also project visions of the future into a person's mind. She ensnares the wraith of [[Celebrimbor]] and holds him prisoner at the start of the game. She releases him after Talion surrenders their newly-forged Ring of Power to her. After Minas Ithil is conquered by Sauron's forces, the Ringwraiths are sent to seize the Ring from her. After the Nine are driven away, she gives the Ring back to Talion and tells him to forge an army to conquer Mordor.
: Reading her memories, which are found throughout Mordor, reveals a number of details of her life, including a romantic relationship she once had with Sauron.
