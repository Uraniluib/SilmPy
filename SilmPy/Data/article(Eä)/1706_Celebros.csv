'''Celebros''' was a stream of [[Beleriand]], a tributary to [[Taeglin]] that flowed through [[Brethil]] forest.<ref>{{CH|A2M}}</ref>  It included the fall [[Dimrost]]<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> which was renamed [[Nen Girith]], the "Shuddering Water", when the resting [[Nienor]] became cold and could not be warmed or comforted.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''Nienor in Brethil''</ref>

[[Glaurung]] was slain by [[TÃºrin]] near the confluence of this stream with Taeglin, which was also near to the spot where Nienor committed suicide by jumping into Taeglin.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>
