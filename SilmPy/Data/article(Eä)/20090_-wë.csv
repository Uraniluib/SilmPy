__NOTOC__
'''''-wë''''' (or ''-we'') is a [[Quenya]] suffix used mainly in masculine names more usual in the [[First Age]]. It is translated as "man" or simply "person".<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 340</ref><ref name=WJAD1>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref><ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 398</ref>

It was seen in names of the Elves of [[Cuiviénen]] and the [[Great March]]: [[Morwë]], [[Nurwë]], [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], [[Elwë]], [[Olwë]], [[Nowë]], [[Lenwë]]; and [[Aranwë]]. 

The ending was also seen in [[Manwë]],<ref name=WJAD1/> and perhaps also in [[Eönwë]].{{fact}} It could be that the ending also is found in the feminine name [[Elenwë]].{{fact}}<!--speculation-->
==Etymology==
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], ''-we'' derives from the [[Primitive Quendian]] ending ''[[-wego]]'' (from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[WEG]]).<ref name=LR/>

In the later text "[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]", the ending derives from the stem [[EWE]], which is also an ancient word for "person".<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 340</ref>

==Cognates==
The element is seen in names of [[Quenya]] form which in turn perhaps represents [[Common Eldarin]]. The name ending did not seem to survive in later generations or in other languages; an exception is the element ''-u'' seen only in the name ''[[Elu]]'' (from *''Elwego'') who was better known as [[Thingol]] in [[Sindarin]]. The Elf ''Nowë'' became better known as [[Círdan]].{{fact}}

Olwë became [[Olue]] in [[Telerin]]. Lenwë was known as [[Denweg]].{{fact}}
