The '''White Hand''' was an emblem of [[Saruman]] during the [[War of the Ring]].  After [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] had been captured, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] came upon the [[Orcs]] slain by [[Boromir]].  Four of the goblin-soldiers bore shields with a small white hand centered in a field of black - these were warriors of [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>

On the road to Isengard there was a tall black pillar upon which was a great stone carved in the likeness of a long white hand with a finger pointing north.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>
