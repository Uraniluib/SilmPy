'''Tréowine''', son of [[Céolwulf]], was a close friend of [[Ælfwine]].
==History==
Around the year [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915 915 AD], in autumn, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes Danes] attacked [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porlock Porlock]. They were at first driven off and Ælfwine's company managed to capture a Danish [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr cnearr] at night. At dawn Ælfwine told to his closest friend, Tréowine, he intended to sail off westward, perhaps to the country of the legendary king [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceafa Sheaf]. Tréowine agreed to accompany him at least as far as to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland Ireland]. They got two other companions: [[Ceola]] of Somerset and [[Geraint]] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Wales West Wales].

Many days after they passed Ireland the voyagers were exhausted. A "dreamlike death" seemed to come over them, and soon they passed out. The last that is known of the journey is that Tréowine saw the world plunge down under them, while sailing the [[Straight Road]].<ref name="2d" />
