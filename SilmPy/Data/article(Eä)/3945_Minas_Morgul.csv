}}'''Minas Morgul''' (originally called '''Minas Ithil''') was the twin city of [[Minas Tirith]] before its fall to the forces of [[Sauron]] in the [[Third Age]].

==History==
===Second Age===
After the destruction of [[Númenor]], [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], the sons of [[Elendil]], landed in [[Gondor]]. Isildur built Minas Ithil near the mountainous border of [[Mordor]] from where he would rule the fief of [[Ithilien]]; while Anárion built [[Minas Anor]] to rule over the fief of [[Anórien]]. Minas Ithil housed a ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'', the [[Ithil-stone]].

When [[Sauron]] returned after escaping [[Númenor]]'s destruction, he attacked the exiles of Númenor, and his forces [[Fall of Minas Ithil|took Minas Ithil]] by storm. When the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] defeated Sauron in the year {{SA|3429}}, Minas Ithil was restored as a watchtower.

===Third Age===
In {{TA|1980}}, the [[Nazgûl]] returned to Mordor (after the defeat of the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in the north of Middle-earth).

The [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] laid siege to Minas Ithil shortly after their return, in {{TA|2002}}, and they took the city for their master, Sauron (who was still hidden at the time).

Minas Ithil was occupied by fell creatures, and it changed into a foul, evil place.  As a result, it came to be called Minas Morgul, which in the [[Gondor Sindarin|tongue of Gondor]] means "Tower of Dark Sorcery". The [[Ithil-stone]], was captured and later used by Sauron to influence [[Denethor|Denethor II]] during the War of the Ring.

During the [[Watchful Peace]] the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the [[Uruk-hai]], and in {{TA|2475}} these creatures assailed and overran Ithilien.

During the [[War of the Ring]], a host from Minas Morgul set forth toward [[Minas Tirith]]. The host was witnessed by Frodo, Sam and Gollum. After some [[Faramir's defense of Osgiliath|opposition in Osgiliath]], the Morgul-host proceeded to [[Pelennor Fields]] and lay [[Siege of Gondor|siege]]. However the host, including the city's garrison was devastated during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

Following the battle, the [[Army of the West]] pulled down the bridge leading to [[Morgul Vale]] and set its fields aflame. They met no opposition as the entire city's garrison had been killed at the Battle.   

After the War of the Ring, [[Faramir]] was made [[Prince of Ithilien]] by King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], who advised him to make his abode in the [[Emyn Arnen]] southeast of Minas Tirith for even though Minas Morgul was completely abandoned, the land was such a terror on the minds of Men that it would not be fit for habitation or even Mannish contact for many years. Eventually, the city was rebuilt as Minas Ithil and the evil that tainted the land was at last gone.

==Description==
[[File:Matthew Burton - Minas Morgul.jpg|350px|thumb|Matthew Burton - ''Minas Morgul'']]
In its prime, Minas Ithil was a beautiful place. The moon cast silver light throughout the courtyards and streets, and reflected off the marble walls, so that it seemed to shine. The houses also shone white. The city also had one tall tower, with many windows, that rotated slowly. The city was accessed by a road, which was said to gleam like the city's white marble walls, running over a bridge as it crossed [[Imlad Morgul]]. Large meadows were placed on both banks of the stream. 

When it was taken by the forces of evil, the beauty was replaced by terror. The lovely white light was replaced by a sickly corpse-pale light, the meadows were filled with sick pale flowers, and Imlad Morgul began to steam cold poisonous vapours. At the head of the bridge crossing the stream the bestial and human figures that stood there were corrupted. <ref>{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing.|[[The Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]}}
