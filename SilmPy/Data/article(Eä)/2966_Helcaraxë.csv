'''Helcaraxë''' (pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌhelkaˈrakse]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌxelkaˈrakse]}}, "ice fangs"<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Helcaraxe"</ref>) was the perilous icy wastes that formerly lay between [[Araman]] (a region in the north of [[Aman]]) and [[Middle-earth]] in the far north of [[Arda]].<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> Here met the [[Ekkaia|Encircling Sea]] and the [[Belegaer]], creating "''vast fogs and mists of deathly cold, and the sea-streams were filled with clashing hills of ice and the grinding of ice deep-sunken''."<ref name=S9/>

At the beginning of the [[First Age]], [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]], escaping from the pursuit of the [[Valar]], fled to Middle-earth across the treacherous wastes of the Helcaraxë. Later, [[Fingolfin]] and his people also made their way into [[Beleriand]] across the Helcaraxë.<ref name=S9>{{S|9}}</ref>

Helcaraxë was also referred to as the '''Grinding Ice'''.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref><ref>{{S|15}}</ref> Another name for this region was perhaps also the '''Narrow Ice''', used by [[Bilbo Baggins]] in his poem [[Song of Eärendil]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Helcaraxe.mp3|Ardamir}}
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], the second element in ''Helkarakse'' is said to be the [[Quenya]] word ''[[karakse]]'' ("jagged hedge of spikes").<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 362 (entry [[KARAK|KARAK-]])</ref> [[Helge Fauskanger]] has suggested that the first element (''hel-'') derives from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHELEK]] ("ice").<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 25 June 2011)</ref>

Also in the ''Etymologies'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] experimented with [[Noldorin]] translations of ''Hekarakse'': ''elcharaes'', ''helcharaes'' or ''Helcharach''.<ref name=LR/><ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 19</ref>
