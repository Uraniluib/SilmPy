}}The '''Nirnaeth Arnoediad''' or '''Battle of Unnumbered Tears''' was the disastrous Fifth Battle in the [[Wars of Beleriand]]. Its name was taken from the first words of the [[Doom of Mandos]]: "Tears unnumbered ye shall shed..."

== Background ==
{{main|Union of Maedhros}}
In the almost two decades since their defeat in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the Noldor had lost control over the entire north of Beleriand, and were, for the most part, reduced to refugees dwelling in [[Hithlum]] and [[Nargothrond]]. [[Gondolin]] was shut up and unknown. 

In the year {{FA|473}}, [[Maedhros]] decided that taking the offence against [[Angband]] might help the [[Noldor]] regain their former lands. 

=== Opposing Forces and Strategy ===

Under the [[Union of Maedhros]] all the [[Elves]] of Beleriand, as well as the [[Edain]], [[Dwarves]], and the newly arrived [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] were invited to combine in arms and fight Morgoth. The Union first cleared Beleriand and Dorthonion of Orcs and then gathered to assault [[Thangorodrim]].

The plan was for Maedhros's host in the east to assault and draw out the army of Angband, after which Fingon's host would attack from the [[Ered Wethrin]], taking the offensive in the west, crushing Morgoth's forces between them.

Under [[Maedhros]] in the east were gathered the remainder of the [[sons of Fëanor]], the Elves and Men of [[Himring]] under Maedhros and [[Bór]], and the men of Amon Ereb under [[Caranthir]] and [[Ulfang]].

Under [[Fingon]] in the west were gathered the Elves and Men of [[Hithlum]], the Elves of the [[Falas]], the [[Haladin]] of Brethil and the companies sent from [[Nargothrond]] and the two elves of [[Doriath]], [[Beleg]] and [[Mablung]].

Because of the evil deeds of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], two of Maedhros's brothers, Nargothrond would send only a small company of Elves under [[Gwindor]]. From Doriath, where [[Thingol]] had sworn never to fight beside any son of Fëanor, came only [[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]], who did not wish to remain behind. However, [[Turgon]] unexpectedly came forth with over ten thousand Elves from [[Gondolin]], doubling the force of the west.

== The Battle ==
[[File:Alan Lee - The Battle of Unnumbered Tears.jpg|left|thumb|[[Alan Lee]] - ''The Battle of Unnumbered Tears'']]
But Morgoth through his spies had learned of the battle plan, and his spy [[Ulfang]], who betrayed the Noldor, delayed [[Maedhros]]' attack. A small host of Orcs sallied forth from [[Angband]] to provoke the Western host to attack. Within sight of the [[Ered Wethrin]], [[Gwindor]]'s brother [[Gelmir]], captured during the Dagor Bragollach, was brought forth, and brutally slain. Enraged, Gwindor broke ranks and charged along with his men. From their hidden positions in the eastern hills, Fingon's forces suddenly charged along with them. The Orc host was taken by surprise and swiftly defeated, and the sudden charge of Fingon's army nearly foiled Morgoth's plans; the forces of Gwindor and Fingon pushed forth, reaching Angband itself.

Morgoth shook upon this throne as Gwindor's company pounded at his gates above. They burst through, and slew the guards on the steps of Angband itself, though Morgoth had trapped them. They were then ambushed with hidden forces set about Angband; all of Gwindor's company was slain and Gwindor himself was captured. From clandestine gates around Angband, thousands of Orcs erupted suddenly, repulsing the host of Fingon from the walls. The Elven army was driven back in great slaughter, and many [[Haladin]] fell fighting in the rearguard.

[[Turgon]], who had withheld his host from the reckless charge, now came upon the Orc host. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the Angband lines, and met with the guard of Fingon. 

Finally, Maedhros arrived, but before he could make junction with Fingon and Turgon, [[Glaurung]] the dragon and [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] lord of [[Balrogs|Balrog]]s intercepted him.  Union forces could yet have prevailed, but [[Uldor]], son of Ulfang and a traitor, turned ranks and attacked Maedhros in the rear, while more of his kin came down from the mountains and attacked from the east. [[Maglor]] slew Uldor in single combat, but could not turn the tide of the battle. Under assault from three sides, the eastern host was scattered, and only the valour of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]] helped them escape, as their lord [[Azaghâl]] and his forces held off Glaurung, allowing the [[sons of Fëanor]] to escape into Ossiriand.

[[Azaghâl]] and his army fought with fierce iron masks on, and they were able to resist the fire far better than any Elf or Man. Then Glaurung trampled Azaghâl beneath his feet, but Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's stomach, and the dragon fled in pain.  Many of Morgoth's forces retreated with him. In a solemn ceremony, the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader, abandoning the battle, and marched him home in a great procession. Their wrath was so great that none troubled them.

All this had not helped the western host, who were attacked by many Orcs under Gothmog. Gothmog cut a path to Fingon and fought him in single combat. Fingon fell under his might, and [[Húrin]] begged Turgon to retreat back to Gondolin. [[Huor]] and Húrin and the remaining [[Men of Dor-lómin]] formed a living wall across the [[Fen of Serech]], buying time for Turgon to escape with most of the surviving Elves of the north. Acting as a rearguard, these Men were almost all slain &ndash; Huor fell when his eye was pierced by a poisoned arrow. His brother Húrin fought ferociously to buy his allies time to escape, fighting until his axe withered away. Morgoth had ordered him to be taken alive, however; he killed no fewer than seventy Orcs and Trolls before he became pinned under their corpses, and was later taken prisoner by Gothmog.

=== Aftermath and Repercussions ===

Morgoth's victory was near complete, as he had destroyed all the people of Hithlum and had scattered the sons of Fëanor away from Himring.  Morgoth's Orcs razed all of [[Beleriand]] except for [[Doriath]], which was still protected by the Girdle of [[Melian]], and sacked the havens of the [[Falas]].

Morgoth betrayed his servants the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]], shutting them in [[Hithlum]] under penalty of death, and denied to them the fertile lands of [[Beleriand]]. Morgoth's destruction was not entirely complete, however, for Turgon, now High King of the Ñoldor after the death of Fingon, had evaded capture, and his city Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. While the Union's attack inflicted fairly heavy losses on Morgoth's forces, this was largely irrelevant compared to how utterly Morgoth had broken the power of so many of his enemies in the battle. His armies would take time to regain their former strength, however, and thus he remained dormant once more for some time, seeking out the hidden city of Gondolin and the last bastion of his enemies. Gwindor himself was one of few prominent survivors of the battle and was enslaved in Morgoth's mines for fourteen years before finally escaping. He returned and warned the [[King of Nargothrond]] that [[Ulmo]] had advised against fighting open war with Morgoth; the King did not heed his advice, however, and at the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], followed by the [[Sack of Nargothrond]], the Elves there were completely eradicated.

The Ñoldor ultimately recovered from the battle but remained hidden within Gondolin away from Morgoth's wrath, where they stayed clandestine and defensively rebuilt their forces. It wasn't until some 38 years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad that Morgoth obtained the location of Gondolin, and [[Fall of Gondolin|besieged it]] in order to finalize his annihilation of the Ñoldor and to cement his domination of Middle-earth.

Morgoth had personally laid waste to Ard-Galen, turning it into a dust-choked wasteland of fire and poisonous gas, known from then on as [[Anfauglith]]. It was here that many Elves and Men were slain and thrown into great piles on a hill in the midst of the desolate landscape; referred to as the [[Hill of Slain]] by the Elves, grass grew on that hill long after the battle but nowhere else in Anfauglith.

==Etymology==
''Nirnaeth ''(or ''Nírnaeth'')'' Arnoediad ''(or ''Arnediad'') is [[Sindarin]] for "Tears Uncountable".<ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

Note that the "oe" of "Arnoediad" is not the Sindarin diphthong "oe", but rather the single [[i-affection|umlaut]] vowel "œ", better represented with a digraph.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>
