The '''Dúnedain''' ([[Sindarin|S]]: "west-men", pron. {{IPA|[ˈduːnedaɪn]}}), singular '''Dúnadan''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈduːnadan]}}), were the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] and their descendants who peopled [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third Ages]]. 

Some [[Númenóreans]] had settled around the haven of [[Pelargir]], but others, who belonged to the [[Faithful]], fled Númenor just before its [[Downfall of Númenor|destruction]], led by [[Elendil]] and his sons. However there were also other colonies in Middle-earth founded by hostile survivors of the Downfall, known as the [[Black Númenóreans]].

The Dúnedain formed the [[Realms in Exile]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], around the [[Middle Men]] who were ruled by Númenórean lords. Originally ruled by the [[High King of the Dúnedain]], they were divided as the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] and the [[Dúnedain of the South|Dúnedain of Gondor]]. Their lords and rulers communicated and surveyed their realms with the seven [[Palantíri]] they brought from Númenor, distributed around their lands.

After the fall of Arnor and then [[Arthedain]], some of the northern Dúnedain became the [[Rangers of the North]]. The surviving Dúnedainic population of Arnor retreated to the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle]] south of [[Rivendell]]. In the meantime the southern Dúnedain, the Men of Gondor, intermarried more and more with so-called [[Middle Men]], except in some regions (such as [[Dol Amroth]]).

In the [[Fourth Age]], the Dúnedain of Gondor and Arnor were [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited]] under king [[Aragorn|Aragorn II Elessar]] (who was also called ''the Dúnadan'').

They are also called the ''Men of the West'' and the ''Men of Westernesse'' (direct translations of the [[Sindarin]] term) and comes from ''[[dûn]]'' and ''[[adan]]''.

The [[Quenya]] name was '''Núnatan''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈnuːnatan]}}), pl. '''Núnatani''' (pron. {{IPA|[nuːˈnatani]}}).

The [[Westron]] name for ''Dúnadan'' was simply '''[[Adûn]]''', "westerner", but this name was seldom used.
