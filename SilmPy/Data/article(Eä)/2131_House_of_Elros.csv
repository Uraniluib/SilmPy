The '''House of Elros''' was the line of descendants begun by [[Elros]], the son of [[Eärendil]] and brother of [[Elrond]]. Due to his ancestry, he was counted as one of the [[Half-elven]], and given the choice of the life of the [[Eldar]] or the [[Gift of Men]]. He chose to live as a mortal, but was granted an extraordinary lifespan of five hundred years. He passed his longevity on to the descendants of his House, though none enjoyed such a count of years as Elros himself. 

As [[Elros|Tar-Minyatur]], Elros was the first [[King of Númenor]]. After his time, that island was ruled by Kings and Queens of his House through nearly three thousand years of the [[Second Age]]. In the end, Elros' distant descendant [[Ar-Pharazôn]] was manipulated by [[Sauron]] into bringing about the [[Downfall of Númenor]], and with it the end of the Line of Kings.<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}</ref>

Though Númenor and its Kings were no more, the House of Elros did not end in the Downfall. The Kings had been descended through Elros' great-great-grandson [[Meneldur]], but another branch of the House also survived: the [[:Category:Lords of Andúnië|Lords of Andúnië]], descended from Meneldur's elder sister [[Silmariën]]. The line of the Lords of Andúnië continued down to Elendil and his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], and so was carried from Númenor to [[Middle-earth]], surviving in the [[Kings of Arnor]] and of [[Gondor]]. Even at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], some six thousand years after the death of its founder, there was still a living heir to the House of Elros: none other than [[Aragorn]] himself.

A family of [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the [[Second Age]]. This family of [[Númenóreans]] were akin to the Lords of Andúnië, and thus related to [[Elendil]] and descended from the House of Elros.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>  After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they had been given the title ''Prince of Belfalas'' by [[Elendil]]<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> and their land, now a fief of [[Gondor]], was called [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas which was succeeded by the [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Princes of Dol Amroth]].

==The Family Tree of the House of Elros==
Showing the descendants of Elros Tar-Minyatur.  All information in the tree is from the ''Unfinished Tales'', either from the chart "The earlier generations of the Line of Elros"<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref> or from "The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor"<ref name="Kings"/> unless otherwise specified.<ref group="note">"The Earlier Generations of the Line of Elros" is only included in some editions of ''Unfinished Tales''.</ref> The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded (when only one figure is shown it is the date of birth).  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name preceded by '*' indicates one of the ruling Kings or Queens of Númenor; an ''italicized'' name denotes a female.  A vertical dashed line indicates a line of descent with some members missing.  Some rulers have a name before the '*', which was their "right name" before taking the [[Sceptre of Númenor|Sceptre]].
