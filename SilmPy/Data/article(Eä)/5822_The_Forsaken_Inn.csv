'''The Forsaken Inn''' appears to have been the easternmost outpost of the [[Bree-land]]. Situated along the [[East Road]], it was, according to [[Aragorn|Strider]], "a day's ride east of [[Bree]]" and he doubted "if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn".<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

It is possible that it was abandoned or ruined by {{TA|2941}} as it is said that [[Thorin and Company]] on the quest to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] found a deserted building where they camped.<ref name=bridge/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Around [[1960]] [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] embarked on a detailed revision of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', with a goal of reconciling it with ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{HH|Fifth}}, The 1960 Hobbit, p. 765</ref>  In the retelling, the sketchy details of the trip from [[Bag End]] to [[Rivendell]] were filled in and made to fit the geography of the later story.  After Thorin's company left [[Bree]], a day's journey brought them to the '''Last Inn''', which they found deserted.<ref name=bridge>{{HH|Fifth}}, The Broken Bridge, p. 792</ref>  There they camped on [[3 May]] {{TA|2941}}, being too depressed to proceed further than the twenty miles they had progressed.<ref>{{HH|Fifth}}, Timelines and Itinerary, p. 816</ref>  [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') states that the Last Inn (later called the Forsaken Inn) was brought in to emphasize the desolation which had grown east of Bree.<ref>{{HH|Fifth}}, Timelines and Itinerary, p. 814</ref>

''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'' included the first map of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  On Map II, in the square K-8, there is a dot with the initials "F.I." on the road east of Bree about one-quarter of the distance to [[Weathertop]].<ref>{{TI|MII}}</ref>  [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that these initials did stand for the Forsaken Inn.<ref>{{TI|First}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:In this adaptation, the role of the inn is greatly expanded. It is the [[Lone-lands]] settlement closest to [[Bree-land]] and lies in the shadow of [[Weathertop]]. A respite for travelers, the Inn has a milestone, mail service, and many merchants, in addition to a great number of people in need of travellers' assistance. These include the Inn's proprietor, Anlaf, and his staff as well as travellers, guests, and some of the Eglain that have recently been displaced from Minas Eriol.

:To the north and northeast lie the ruins of the fortifications of the war between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]], now occupied and spanned by camps of [[orcs]] and goblins. Ruins also lie to the south-east, and along both sides of the road to the East. A long journey across the Lone-lands in that direction eventually leads to Ost Guruth, the last settlement before the [[Hoarwell]], which marks the borders of the [[Trollshaws]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Landmark:The_Forsaken_Inn|articlename=The Forsaken Inn|dated=|website=[http://lorebook.lotro.com/ LoreBook.Lotro.com]|accessed=20 February 2013}}</ref>
