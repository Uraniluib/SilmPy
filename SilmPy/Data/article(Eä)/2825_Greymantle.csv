'''Greymantle''' was a title borne by two famous characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works. The first of these was [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], the King of [[Doriath]] in the [[First Age]]. His [[Sindarin]] name Thingol (and its older [[Quenya]] equivalent, [[Singollo]]) both meant '[[Greycloak]]' or 'Greymantle'. 

The name reappeared in a quite different form in the [[Third Age]], when it was one of many acquired by the Wizard [[Gandalf]] on his journeys. It was said to come from a name given to him in the [[Westron]] or [[Westron|Common Tongue]]. That original name was possibly [[Gandalf#Names|Inc√°nus]], translated into the language of the [[Rohirrim]] as [[Greyhame]], and so into modern English as 'Greymantle'.
