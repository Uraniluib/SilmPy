'''Valmar''' or '''Valimar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈval(i)mar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈβal(i)mar]}}) was the city of many bells in the heart of [[Valinor]] where many of the [[Valar]] and [[Maiar]] dwelt. It lay on the [[Girdle of Arda]] in the east-central part of the Plain of Valinor, west of [[Taniquetil]].<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref> 

The [[Two Trees of Valinor]] grew nearby on the mound of [[Ezellohar]]. It is said that the houses in Valmar had roofs of gold and their floors silver and their doors were of polished bronze; and that they were lifted with spells and their stones were bound with magic.

== Etymology ==
The name '''Valmar''' means "dwelling of the Valar" (from [[Valar|Vala]] and [[-mbar|mar]] = "dwelling").
