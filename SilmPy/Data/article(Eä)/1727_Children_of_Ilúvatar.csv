The '''Children of [[Ilúvatar]]''' also '''Híni Ilúvataro''' or '''Eruhíni'''<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref> are the two races of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. Their existence, along with the [[Eä|Universe]] in which they were to live, was conceived in the [[Music of the Ainur]], but the [[Ainur]] had no part in their making. Ilúvatar alone brought them into being, and they had ''[[fëar]]'' (spirits) of the same type as the Ainur, though far less powerful.

Unlike the Ainur, however, the Children were intended to exist as a union of flesh and spirit; their bodies, or ''[[hröar]]'', are as integral to their being as their ''[[fëar]]''. As such, they are also called [[Incarnate|Incarnates]].

While their status as embodied souls created by Ilùvatar makes them extraordinarily alike, each Kindred of the Children was also bestowed with different gifts from their maker. The Elves received great beauty, near [[immortality]], skill with arts and crafts, and keen memories. Men, on the other hand, were given freedom to act outside the boundaries set by the [[Music of the Ainur]], eventual [[Dominion of Men|supremacy]] over [[Middle-earth]], and [[Gift of Men|mortality]].

Elves were the first of the Children of Ilúvatar to appear in [[Middle-earth]]; Men were not to follow until the rising of the [[Sun]] and the beginning of the [[First Age]], many thousands of years later.

Both Kindreds awoke in the far east of Middle-earth: the Elves at [[Cuiviénen]] and Men in [[Hildórien]].

The [[Dwarves]], while also incarnates, are not typically called Children of Ilúvatar, for though they were given sapience and independent being by [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], they were in fact created by [[Aulë]]. When Eru gave blessing to Aulë's work, he distinguished the Dwarves from Elves and Men by calling them "the children of my adoption" while referring to Elves and Men as "the children of my choice." 
==Parallels between Men and Elves==
The history of Men and their races throughout the Ages, bore some similarities to that of the Elves, especially during the [[First Age]].

Both Elves and Men originated somewhere in the East ([[Cuiviénen]] and [[Hildórien]]) and then both marched for the [[Westlands|West]] ([[Eldar]] and [[Edain]]) leaving some of them behind ([[Avari]] and [[Men of Darkness]]).

They were divided mainly into three groups ([[Vanyar]]/[[Noldor]]/[[Teleri]] and [[House of Beor]]/[[House of Hador]]/[[House of Haleth]]) when they reached [[Beleriand]].

Eventually some of them ([[Calaquendi]] and [[Númenóreans]]) passed the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and reached a western place ([[Valinor]] and [[Númenor]]). They advanced and prospered near the [[Light of Valinor]] while their kin were left behind in [[Middle-earth]].

There, some were corrupted by the [[Sauron|Enemy]] which caused a Fall ([[Noldolante]] and [[Atalante]]). A part of them returned to Middle-earth and founded realms ([[Exile of the Noldor]] and [[Realms in Exile]]) becoming Kings among their "lesser" kin.

==Etymology==
'''''Eruhíni''''' (sing. ''Eruhin'') is the [[Quenya]] term. It contains the name [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], [[the One]] (a name for [[Ilúvatar]]) and ''[[hín]]'', 'child'.<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 403</ref>
