:A Decipher card identifies one of the Gondorians of [[Minas Tirith]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' as Derufin.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Derufin and [[Duilin (son of Duinhir)|his brother]] were hunting enthusiasts. Bored waiting for battle, they sneaked across the river to [[Ithilien]] to hunt. They could be found in Bar Húrin. In [[The Strength of Sauron|Epic Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron]] the player accompanied them as they attempted to hunt [[Oliphaunts|mûmakil]]. They encountered more than one mûmak and, finding them larger than expected, were quickly forced to flee. However the brothers noted the beasts' eyes as vulnerable targets, and despite the failure they agreed to help the player search [[Osgiliath]] for [[Faramir]] in exchange for the assistance. The brothers accompanied the player into the city, and the group succeeded in damaging [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] before encountering [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] and being forced to retreat.
