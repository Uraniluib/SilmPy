:''Not to be confounded with: '''[[Sunlands]]''', the name of [[Harad]] in the [[Westron|Common Speech]]''
'''Sunlending''' was the name used by the [[Rohirrim]] of the land of ''[[An칩rien]]'', 'Sun-land'. It is mentioned in the song ''From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning'', l. 15: "''six thousand spears to Sunlending''".<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

The name ''Sunlending'' did not refer to the climate, but was rather 'heraldic', as An칩rien was immediately attached to [[Minas Anor]]. ''Sunlending'' was thus connected to the name and the emblem of [[An치rion]], brother of [[Isildur]].<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>
