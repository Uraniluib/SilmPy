{{quote|And it came to pass after many years of journeying in this manner that the [[Eldar]] took their course through a forest, and they came to a '''great river''', wider than any they had yet seen; and beyond it were [[Misty Mountains|mountains]] whose sharp horns seemed to pierce the realm of the stars.|''[[The Silmarillion]]''<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>}}
'''Anduin''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈanduɪn]}} as two syllables) was the river that crossed most of [[Middle-earth]] east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Passing through many lands, it had received many names - '''Langflood''' by the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]], the '''Great River of Wilderland''' in the [[Westron]] of [[Rivendell]] and [[the Shire]], and simply the '''Great River''' in [[Gondor]]. All these names are in recognition of the river's length.

It flowed from its source in the [[Grey Mountains|Grey]] and [[Misty Mountains]] to the [[Ethir Anduin]] in the [[Belegaer|Great Sea (Belegaer)]]. In her ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth|Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimated the river had a total run of 1,388 miles.

==Source==
The Anduin began as two different streams near where the Misty Mountains met the Grey. These were called the [[Langwell]] and the [[Greylin]] by the [[Éothéod]] when they lived in the triangle of land formed by it. Their old capital [[Framsburg]] was built at the confluence of these streams where the Anduin proper began. The [[Langwell]] had its source in the Misty Mountains, close to [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]], and the [[Greylin]] began in the westernmost heights of the Grey Mountains.

==Course==

The Anduin flowed parallel to the [[Misty Mountains]] in a [[Vales of Anduin|broad vale]] which formed the western part of [[Rhovanion]], lying between the mountains and [[Mirkwood]]. After passing [[Lothlórien]], the river and mountains parted company, and the river flowed through the [[Brown Lands]] via the [[North Undeep|North]] and [[South Undeep|South Undeeps]] until it flowed past the [[Emyn Muil]] and the [[Argonath]] and entered [[Nen Hithoel]] through [[Sarn Gebir]], a series of ferocious rapids. Thence it flowed over the Falls of [[Rauros]], and past the [[Mouths of Entwash]] and the marshes known as the [[Nindalf|Wetwang]]. It then passed between the [[White Mountains]] and the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]] by the capital of [[Gondor]], [[Osgiliath]], before swinging past the harbour of [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]] close to the [[Rammas Echor]], south of [[Minas Tirith]]. It flowed through the port of [[Pelargir]], entering the Great Sea in the [[Bay of Belfalas]] in a broad delta known as the Mouths of Anduin.

In order from north to south: the [[Rhimdath]] (Rushdown), the [[Gladden River|Ninglor]] (Gladden) which joined at the marshes known as the [[Gladden Fields]], the [[Celebrant]] (Silverlode), the River [[Limlight]], the [[Entwash|Onodló]] (Entwash), the [[Morgulduin]], the [[Erui]], the [[Sirith]] and the [[Poros]]. The first five had their sources in the Misty Mountains, the Morgulduin and (presumably) the Poros in the Ephel Dúath on the border of [[Mordor]], and the rest in the White Mountains.

===Crossing Points===
The [[Old Forest Road]] which led from the [[High Pass]] into Mirkwood crossed the river at the Old Ford, to the south of [[Beorn|Beorn's Halls]]. There used to be a bridge, this was fortified when [[Elendil]] crossed the river to [[War of the Last Alliance|go to war]] with [[Sauron]], but it had been destroyed by the late [[Third Age]]. The only other bridge was in [[Osgiliath]], but during the late Third Age, this was broken by forces of [[Mordor]].

===Islands===
The principal islands appear to have been [[Cair Andros]], on the borders of [[Ithilien]] and [[Tol Brandir]] in Nen Hithoel. [[Carrock]], in the north was where the Eagles deposited [[Thorin and Company]]. There was also an eyot, where the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] rested during their travel between Lórien and [[Parth Galen]].

==Settlements==
During the [[Great March|March of the Elves]] in the [[Years of the Trees|Time of the Trees]], the [[Nandor]] left the [[Eldar|Eldarin]] host when faced with the great heights of the Misty Mountains, and lived in the [[Vales of Anduin]]. Some of those people later left and became the Green-elves of [[Ossiriand]], but Elves remained present even until the time of the War the Ring, strengthed by refugees from [[Beleriand]] (at the end of the [[First Age]]) and [[Eregion]] (during the [[Second Age|Second]]).

Settlements in the Vale of Anduin during the Third Age included the [[Éothéod]] city of [[Framsburg]], [[Rhosgobel]], [[Beorn]]'s Halls and the [[Stoors|Stoor]] settlements near the Gladden Fields. It was in the [[Gladden Fields]] in the northern reaches of Anduin that [[Isildur]] was slain in {{TA|2}} and [[the One Ring]] lost; and it was there, more than two millennia later, that [[Déagol]] found the Ring and [[Sméagol]] took it from him. 

Once it had entered Gondor the river flowed past Osgiliath and Minas Tirith and then Pelargir, close to the sea. After the fall of Osgiliath the river effectively marks the eastern limit of Gondor's influence.

==Etymology==

''Anduin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "long river" or "great river", composed of ''[[and]]'' + ''[[duin]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 11</ref><ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 23</ref>
