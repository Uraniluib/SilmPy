'''Avallónë''' was a city and seaport on the eastern shore of the island of [[Tol Eressëa]]. Its name indicated that it was the city nearest to [[Valinor]] and the tower of Avallónë was the first sight that a mariner beheld as he approached the [[Undying Lands]]. The city was described as white-shining with a great harbour with lamplit quays.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> It had a tower where the [[Master-stone]] abode. 
 	
==History==
After the [[War of Wrath]] and the downfall of [[Morgoth]] the [[Valar]] summoned the [[Eldar]] to return to the West. Not all obeyed this new summons but those who did dwelt on Tol Eressëa.
 
In the [[Second Age]] some of the Men of [[Númenor]], those most far-sighted, could see Avallónë from the summit of the [[Meneltarma]] or from a tall ship that lay off the western coast as far as was lawful to go. Some thought this far off vision was of Valinor itself but the wise knew it was but Avallónë. While the [[Númenóreans]] respected the [[Ban of the Valar]] many elves would sail to Númenor; they brought birds, flower, and herbs to the land.
 
The sight of Avallónë beyond their reach helped to kindle resentment in the hearts of the Númenóreans against the Ban. As the people of the island turned against the Valar the visits of the Eldar became few and only made in secret to the [[Faithful]]. By the reign of [[Tar-Palantir]] the city of Avallónë was veiled in cloud.<ref name="Akallabeth"/>
 
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the island of Tol Eressëa with Avallónë and the Undying Lands beyond were removed from the world. Yet in the towers of the [[Emyn Beraid]] was kept the [[Elostirion-stone|Palantir of Elostirion]], which allowed the Elves to see the Tower of Avallónë, where the [[Master-stone]] abode.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>
 
==Inspiration==
In [[Letter to Milton Waldman|a letter to Milton Waldman]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] states that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] were given an "Arthurian ending".<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}, p. 132</ref> It has been suggested by [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] that Tolkien was emphasising this connection in the name Avallónë, echoing the island of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon Avalon] that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur King Arthur] goes to in order to recover from his wounds.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, 677</ref>
