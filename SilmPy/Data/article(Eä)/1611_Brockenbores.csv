'''Brockenbores''', or '''Brockenborings''', was a network of tunnels in the northern part of [[the Shire]]'s [[Eastfarthing]], in the hilly region of [[Scary]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  This was one of the more outlying parts of the Shire, which was perhaps the reason that a band of [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] rebels led by [[Fredegar Bolger]], hid here for a time when '[[Sharkey]]' took control of the Shire during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name of this place is given as 'Brockenbores' in the text of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but as "Brockenborings" on ''[[A Part of the Shire]]''. 

[[David Salo]] suggests a speculative derivation from [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] *''Broccesboran''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

The name(s) translate approximately as "badger-burrowings".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 767</ref>
