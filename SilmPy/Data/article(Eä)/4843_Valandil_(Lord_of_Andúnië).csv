}}'''Valandil''' was the son of [[Elatan]] of [[Andúnië]] and [[Silmariën]], the eldest daughter of [[Tar-Elendil]], the fourth [[King of Númenor]].<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref><ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref>  

However, when it came time for Tar-Elendi to relinquish the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] it did not pass on to Silmariën or her sister [[Isilmë]]; instead it went to Tar-Elendil's third child [[Tar-Meneldur|Meneldur]].<ref group=note>The royal law of succession at that time (actually an unquestioned inherited custom) stated that the Sceptre was to be inherited by the Ruler's eldest son.<br>In ''[[Aldarion and Erendis]]'' we learn that later, Tar-Meneldur's son [[Tar-Aldarion]] altered the law so that the eldest ''child'' of the King, whether man or woman, would receive the Sceptre. Had this law existed when Tar-Elendil relinquished the Sceptre, Silmariën would have been the first [[Ruling Queen]] and Valandil and his descendants would have been the rulers of Númenor.</ref>

As Silmarien or Valandil could not become Kings of Númenor, Tar-Elendil instead made Valandil the first of the [[Lords of Andúnië]], who ruled the city in [[Andustar]] in western [[Númenor]] and were held in the highest honor after the Kings.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref><ref name="Akallabeth"/> As a ruler of one of the divisions of Númenor Valandil was also a member of the [[Council of the Sceptre]],<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 23</ref> a position that was inherited by his descendants.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Valandil was a close cousin of [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] and twice hosted feasts for him in Andúnië, on the one hundredth anniversary of the founding of the [[Guild of Venturers]] and again in midsummer of {{SA|870}} when the newly wedded Aldarion and [[Erendis]] visited.<ref name="Wife"/>

In time, one of the descendants of Valandil was [[Elendil]],<ref>{{UT|Kings}}</ref> the first [[High King of the Dúnedain]] in [[Middle-earth]]. Elendil's son was [[Isildur]] and from his line, many generations later, came [[Aragorn]].
==Etymology==
''Valandil'' means "Devoted to the [[Valar]]" in [[Quenya]] (from ''Vala'' and the suffix ''[[-ndil]]'', 'friend of', 'devoted to').
