The '''City Wall''' was the protective stone wall that enclosed [[Minas Tirith]] on its lowest level. Its only opening was the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]] that pierced the wall at its easternmost point.<ref name="Tirith">{{RK|V1}}</ref>

{{quote|For the main wall of the City was of great height and marvellous thickness, built ere the power and craft of [[NÃºmenor]] waned in exile; and its outward face was like to the Tower of [[Orthanc]], hard and dark and smooth, unconquerable by steel or fire, unbreakable except by some convulsion that would rend the very earth on which it stood.|{{RK|V4}}}}

==History==
The city of Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith) was built after {{SA|3320}} upon the founding of the realm of Gondor.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> The City Wall may have been built at this time although it is unknown if the fortress-city had all seven of its levels at its earliest stage.

In the great [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the host of [[Sauron]] did not attempt to breach the City Wall; instead they concentrated upon breaking the Great Gate.<ref name="Siege">{{RK|V4}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On a plan of Minas Tirith, drawn on the back of a typescript page, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote "'''Othram''' or City Wall" to the left of the words "Great Gate".<ref>{{WR|3|III}}, p. 288</ref> Although the phrase "City Wall" was used in ''[[The Return of the King]]'',<ref name="Tirith"/> the [[Sindarin]] word ''Othram'' was not included.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Although the text of ''The Return of the King'' states that the outer wall of Minas Tirith was "dark" (see quotation above) in the movie, as in other depictions of the City, the wall is white.
