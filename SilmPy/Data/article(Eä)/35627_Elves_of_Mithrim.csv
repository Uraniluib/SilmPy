The '''Elves of Mithrim''' were the [[Sindar|Sindarin]] inhabitants of the land of [[Mithrim]].

The Elves of Mithrim crossed into [[Hithlum]] from [[Beleriand]] at some time before the rising of the [[Sun]], settling in the regions around [[Lake Mithrim]].<ref>{{WJ|B}}</ref> They were the first Elves of [[Middle-earth]] encountered by the [[Noldor]] upon their return from [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> [[Fingolfin]] took up lordship in Hithlum, with most of his own people dwelling around the shores of Lake Mithrim,<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and there was presumably a degree of intermingling between the two peoples. It is not stated to what extent the Grey-elves of Mithrim participated in the Wars of Beleriand under Fingolfin and Fingon. After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] they sheltered [[RÃ­an]];<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> when she departed Hithlum, one of the Elves, [[Annael]], fostered her son [[Tuor]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Mithrim'' has two alternate etymologies. In the earlier version, ''Mithrim'' was [[Noldorin]] in origin, including the roots ''mith-'' "fog, misty, grey" and ''-rhim(b)'' "cold" or "cold lake".<ref>{{LR|P3}}</ref>

A later version is that ''Mithrim'' "grey folk" was applied by the Sindar of Beleriand to their kindred who had gone north into Hithlum. The climate north of [[Ered Wethrin]] was cool, misty, and grey, but the Elves also wove a grey cloth that aided in their concealment. It is also suggested that the Noldor first used the term ''Sindar'' (or ''Sindeldi'') to refer to the Elves of Mithrim, later applying it to all the [[Sindarin]]-speaking Elves of Beleriand.<ref name="Author">{{WJ|Author}}</ref>
