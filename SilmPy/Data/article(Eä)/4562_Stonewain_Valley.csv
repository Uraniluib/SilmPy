'''Stonewain Valley''' was a long narrow straight valley in the eastern [[White Mountains]], deep within the [[Drúadan Forest]]. Its eastern end opened just to the north-west of the [[Rammas Echor]] that encircled [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==History==
A road, four horses wide, had been made in ancient days by the [[Men]] of [[Gondor]],<ref name="Ride">{{RK|V5}}</ref> as a route from the quarries beneath [[Min-Rimmon]] to [[Minas Anor]].<ref name="Parma 17">{{PE|17}}, p. 28</ref>

By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], it was overgrown and all but forgotten. However, on [[13 March]] {{TA|3019}}, King [[Théoden]] met with [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] in the Drúadan Forest<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and the headman of the [[Woses]] revealed the existence of the old road. During the next day the [[Rohirrim]] used the road in Stonewain Valley to avoid the [[Orcs]] blocking the main road to come to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name="Ride"/>

== Etymology ==
The name was given because of the "''wains (sleds or drays) passed to and fro from the stone-quarries''" along the long, narrow defile.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>

In [[Quenya]] it was called ''Nand' Ondolunkava'' or ''Ondolunkanan(do)'', in [[Sindarin]] ''Nan Gondresgion'' and in [[Rohirric]] ''Stānwægna Dæl''.<ref name="Parma 17"/> Another Sindarin name, a translation of "Stonewain Valley", was ''Imrath Gondraich'', where ''imrath'' meant "a long narrow valley with a road or watercourse running through it lengthwise."<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Stonewain Valley''</ref>
