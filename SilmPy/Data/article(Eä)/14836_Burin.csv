'''Burin''' was a Dwarf that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] abandoned while in the process of creating ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==History==
Burin first started out as the son of [[Balin]] and attended the council of [[Elrond]] with [[Glóin]], as well as accompanying the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] on their quest.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>  When that idea was abandoned and [[Gimli]] was created in his stead, the name was used for the father of Balin, but that was scrapped in favour of [[Fundin]].<ref>{{RS|Moria}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Burin, or ''Burinn'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "Son-like".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
