}}'''Ingold''' was a soldier of [[Gondor]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
On the road that passed northward from [[Minas Tirith]] into [[Rohan]], at the point where it passed through the encircling wall of the [[Rammas Echor]], a guard of [[Gondorians]] was posted . Their leader was Ingold, by whose permission [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] entered the town-lands of Minas Tirith on their journey southwards from Rohan.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> 

Days after Gandalf had passed, an army out of the east crossed the River [[Anduin]] and descended on Ingold's position. He retreated with his men back to the city, reporting that the northern road had fallen into the hands of the enemy. This was woeful news in Minas Tirith, because it was thought to mean that the [[Rohirrim]] could not come to their aid.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''Ingoldo''', or ''i [[Noldor|Ñoldo]]'', was [[Finrod]]'s [[amilessë|mothername]]. It became a frequent given name in [[Númenor]], and in the [[Third Age]] it was shortened to '''Ingold''' under influence of [[Westron]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 30</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
