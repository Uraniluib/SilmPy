'''Far Harad''', a part of the larger region known as [[Harad]], was a name used in Northwestern [[Middle-earth]] for a distant, unknown land far to the south of [[Gondor]].<ref name=RKV6>{{RK|V6}}</ref> The name simply means the Far South ([[Sindarin]] ''[[Harad#Etymology|harad]]'', "south"),<ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref> as opposed to [[Near Harad]], the more familiar southern lands.

Some of the people of Far Harad travelled north at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], and fought on the side of [[Sauron]] at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. These warriors (which were described as [[Half-trolls]]) had black skin.<ref name=RKV6/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] stated that [[Gandalf]] might have made (although unlikely) a visit to Far Harad during one of his travels, but that it was too short a visit for there having "''acquired a special name''".<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Far Harad (said to be called Bozisha-Miraz in the local tongue) is fleshed out with detailed descriptions of the geography, flora and fauna, peoples, etc.<ref>{{ICE|3800}}</ref>
