'''WOR''' is an [[Elvish]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "express, cause to exude (by pressure)" and is an element in the word ''[[miruvor]]''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 38</ref><ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 191</ref>  

Note that the root appears to have been rejected by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], who wrote that "this is [[Wikipedia:false etymology|false etymology]] [...] there was not in fact any word ''wor-'' in Elvish, [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]]."<ref name=PE17/> One can interpret Tolkien's note in several ways:
*The Elves falsely thought that the latter elements of ''[[miruvor|miruvórë/miruvor]]'' derived from a presumed root WOR.
*Tolkien altogether removed the root WOR (and its relation to ''miruvórë/miruvor'') from the [[legendarium]] .
