The '''Northern Army''' refers to the army that defended northern [[Gondor]] from the [[Wainriders]] from the east in {{TA|1944}}.  King [[Ondoher]] led the Northern Army in the center along with his son [[Artamir]].  His right flank was commanded by [[Minohtar]], while his left flank was commanded by [[Adrahil I]].  The army was mostly destroyed in a battle near the [[Black Gate]] by the Wainriders, who slew Ondoher and Artamir as well.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>  However, when [[EÃ¤rnil]] and the [[Southern Army]] hastened north they gathered the remnants of the Northern Army into their ranks and defeated the Wainriders.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
