'''Gwindor''' was a prince of the [[Elves of Nargothrond]].
==History==
He was the son of [[Guilin]] and brother of [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]. While he was in [[Nargothrond]], he was betrothed to [[Finduilas]] the daughter of [[Orodreth]]. His brother was lost during the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. Wishing to avenge his loss, he joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] and followed [[Fingon]] to battle.

During the assault, Gwindor led a small company of Elves of Nargothrond stationed at [[Barad Eithel]]. But the hosts of [[Morgoth]] were prepared; they brought his brother and mutilated and slew him. At the sight of Gelmir's mangled corpse, he charged on the plains of [[Anfauglith]], and thus beginning the battle of [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. It is said that Morgoth trembled as his company pounded on his gates, but he had ambushed the company within Angband itself, and all but Gwindor were slain.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

He spent fourteen years as a captive slave in the mines of Angband where the strength and beauty of his body was ruined, and he lost a hand. But he escaped and while in [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] he was found by [[Beleg]] who was looking for his friend [[Túrin]]. Gwindor helped Beleg locate the [[Orc]]-band that had captred Túrin, and they freed him. But Túrin thought Beleg was an orc and killed him before realizing his mistake. Gwindor consoled Túrin in his grief and led him to Nargothrond.
===Return to Nargothrond===
Túrin was admitted in the Elven realm thanks to Gwindor, but now Gwindor was worn out and did not have the power he once had before his capture. "Agarwaen" (Túrin's name while he stayed there) gained much influence among the Elves of Nargothrond and even Finduilas fell in love with him, a fact that Gwindor accepted without bitterness for Túrin. Believing that Finduilas would save Túrin from his fate, Gwindor revealed Agarwaen's identity to Finduilas, while he tried to persuade Túrin to return her feelings.

But when Túrin talked about open warfare upon Morgoth's forces, Gwindor could see the incoming doom of Nargothrond approach and counselled against this, only to be ignored. Orodreth the [[King of Nargothrond]] built a bridge, which not only eliminated the defense provided by the river [[Narog]], but also revealed the location of the Kingdom.

Indeed, Gwindor was right and [[Glaurung]] with a band of Orcs came. The Elves were driven towards the plain of [[Tumhalad]], where most of them, including King Orodreth and Gwindor, were slain in [[Battle of Tumhalad|battle]]. Before dying, he assigned the protection of Finduilas to Túrin, and that she alone could save him from the Curse of Morgoth; however his prophecy did not come to be, as Túrin failed to protect her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gwindor.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name is not explained, however in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the name-element ''-dor'' (a compounded form of [[Noldorin]] ''[[taur]]'') has the sense of "king, master".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry TA, TA3</ref>

It has been suggested that the first element of the name could be ''gwind'' "pale blue".<ref>{{webcite|website=EoA|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/gwindor.html|articlename=Gwindor}}, citing {{LR|Etymologies}}, entry WIN</ref>
<!-- Another possibility from The Etymologies could be gwing "spindrift" -->
