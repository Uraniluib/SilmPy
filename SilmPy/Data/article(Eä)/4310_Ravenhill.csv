[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Ravenhill.jpg|thumb|300px|Azog's Ravenhill command post in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'']]'''Ravenhill''' was an outlying hill beneath the height of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the [[Lonely Mountain]].  It stood at the end of a ridge of high ground extending southwards from the mountain itself, overlooking the [[River Running]] and the valley of [[Dale]].<ref name=door>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>  

The [[Dwarves of Erebor]] built a guard-post on the hill, about five hours march from the [[Front Gate]] to the Mountain,<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref> and above its chamber for many years lived friendly intelligent [[ravens]], like [[Carc]]. It was they, and the ravens of hill, that gave it its name.<ref name="Gathering">{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] made their first camp north of the hill as they reached Erebor.<ref name=door/>  Much later the Company returned to Ravenhill when they made their escape from the Mountain.  After spending one night in the rock chamber on the hill the thrush that they had last seen on the "Doorstep" came to them.  When [[Balin]] wished that it was a raven the thrush flew off and brought back [[Roäc]], who gave them the news of the death of [[Smaug]] and the approach of the [[Elves]] and [[Lake-men]].<ref name="Gathering"/>

In the [[Battle of Five Armies]] the [[Elves]], [[Gandalf]], and [[Bilbo Baggins]] took a stand on Ravenhill.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>  Knocked senseless, Bilbo woke up in this same place the next morning (having not been found since he had been wearing [[The One Ring|the Ring]] when he was struck down).<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', when the Company climbed up to Ravenhill [[Thorin]] pointed to a rocky opening and stated that "steps lead down back into the mountain".<ref>{{HH|While}}, p. 583</ref>  That there was to be a tunnel from Ravenhill into the Lonely Mountain was further suggested in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s plot notes, in which the opening was to be guarded by [[Dori]] and [[Nori]].<ref>{{HH|PNE}}, p. 626</ref>  This tunnel did not appear in the finished work.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:In the film the area of the Ravenhill has several Dwarven ruins, like stairs and turrets. The Dwarves go to Ravenhill to see the destruction of Lake-town from a distance. During the battle, it is used by [[Azog]] as his command center. Thorin decides to run there to kill him, followed by [[Dwalin]], [[Kíli]] and [[Fíli]]. However they find nobody when they arrive there. [[Bilbo]] follows them invisible, and [[Tauriel]] and [[Legolas]] also arrive to warn the Dwarves of [[Bolg]]'s army approaching from [[Gundabad]]. Fíli is captured by Azog, who executes him in front of the Dwarves. Thorin engages Azog in a fight on a frozen lake, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and Kíli temporarily saves her only to be killed. Legolas also battles Bolg on a fallen tower stuck between two edges and eventually kills him throwing him from the edge. Azog has Thorin on the edge of his sword, and Thorin allows him to penetrate him, so that he can kill Azog. 

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Dís]] served as the main caretaker of Ravenhill, and tended the birds that flocked there. The Ravens, led by Arcah, Daughter of Croär, returned to live at Ravenhill.
