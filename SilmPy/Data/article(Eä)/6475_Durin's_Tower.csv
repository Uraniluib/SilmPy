'''Durin's Tower''' was the tower upon the [[Celebdil|Silvertine]]. It was built by the [[Dwarves]] in ancient times on the peak of the Silvertine, which they called [[Celebdil|Zirakzigil]] - one of the three [[Mountains of Moria]] under which lay the realm of [[Moria|Khazad-dum]]. The tower was carved out of the living rock of the mountain and stood upon a high eyrie. The [[Endless Stair]] led to the tower from the foundations of the mountain.<ref name="White">{{TT|III5}}</ref>

By the end of the [[Third Age]], Durin's Tower had long been lost. Some Dwarves believed it had been destroyed, while others thought it was only a legend. On [[23 January]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Gandalf]] and the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] climbed the Endless Stair to Durin's Tower. Upon the Silvertine they [[Battle of the Peak|fought]] until Gandalf defeated the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] [[25 January|two days later]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> During the battle, the tower was destroyed and the entrance to the stair was blocked.<ref name="White"/>
