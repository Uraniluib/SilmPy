The '''Towers of the Teeth''' stood at the northwest corner of [[Mordor]], the [[Ephel Dúath]] and the [[Ered Lithui]] came together at the haunted Pass of [[Cirith Gorgor]], and formed a gateway into that dark land. In the early days of [[Gondor]], after [[Sauron]]'s first defeat, the [[Gondorians]] built two watchtowers at the entrance to the pass, to guard Mordor and prevent the return of Sauron's servants. They failed, and the watchtowers fell under the control of the [[Sauron#Eye of Sauron|Red Eye]]. They became known as [[Carchost]] and [[Narchost]], the Towers of the Teeth.

Other names include the ''Teeth of Mordor'', the ''Towers of the Black Gate'', and the ''Watch-towers of Morannon''.
