'''Forannest''' was the northern gate of the [[Rammas Echor]], the great encircling wall of the [[Pelennor Fields]].  
==History==
It was located in the north-west part of the Rammas and the northern road from [[Minas Tirith]] ran through Forannest joining the [[Great West Road]].

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took]] passed through the gate which was under the command of [[Ingold]]. Several days later the forces of [[Sauron]] coming from the [[Morannon]], took [[Cair Andros]] and breached the Rammas Echor, destroying Forannest, and Ingold and his men were the last to retreat from the wall to Minas Tirith.

Two days later the [[Rohirrim]] passed through Forannest and the breaches around it, therefore leading to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. 
==Etymology==
The name is apparently [[Noldorin]] (which was later re-envisioned as [[Sindarin]]) and is glossed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] as "North Entrance ..." with an obscure final word looking as "in".<ref name=wr354>{{HM|WR}}, p. 354</ref>

The name seems to be composed of the Noldorin/Sindarin elements ''forn'' "north", ''[[annon]]'' "gate" and ''nest'' which probably means "heart, core".<ref>{{HM|WR}}, p. 357, note 18</ref><ref group=note>In the same note Tolkien provided the related words ''nesta'' and ''nethra'' , but with inexplicable meaning.</ref>

==Other versions==
Earlier names of the gate that Tolkien rejected were ''Fornest'' and ''Anfornest''.<ref name=wr354/>

The name appears only in drafts from the 1940s and didn't make it to the final ''[[Return of the King]]''.
