==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]] was the leader who led the people of the third house of the Edain across the Ered Luin into Beleriand and Adanel was his sister.  When the House of Hador genealogy was changed so that Marach was the first leader then Adanel became the great-aunt of Hador.

There were two versions of the genealogical table for the House of Hador.  In the first version of the table there was a note that Beren, son of Belemir and Adanel, was their fifth child.  In the second version there was no reference to these other children.  The section of the second version shown above shows only the first Beren although the other children may have existed.<ref name="WJwest"/>
