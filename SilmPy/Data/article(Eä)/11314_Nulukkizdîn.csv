'''Nulukkizdîn''' or '''Nulukkhizdīn''' was a hall of the [[Petty-dwarves]] on the river [[Narog]].

==History==
Nulukkizdîn was delved by Dwarves before the [[Elves]] were exiled from [[Valinor]]. Over the years, its population waned, and others were hunted to near-extinction by the Elves, who were unfamiliar with the Petty-dwarves. Nulukkizdîn was eventually abandoned, and repopulated by Elves. [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] founded [[Nargothrond]] in its stead. After Nargothrond fell to [[Glaurung]], the last Petty-dwarf, [[Mîm]], reclaimed it, but he was slain by [[Húrin]].<ref name="S22"/>

==Etymology==
Tolkien provided no translations of either '''Nulukkizdîn''' or '''Nulukkhizdīn'''. The last element is usually believed to be the [[Khuzdul]] root for "Dwarf", Kh-Z-D.<ref name="Ardalambion">[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul]", published at ''[[Ardalambion]]''</ref> Whether this is a true Khuzdul word or a Petty-dwarvish dialect is unknown, but circumstantial evidence points to the latter option. The [[Angerthas Daeron]] and its specific Dwarven variation [[Angerthas Moria]], do not have a symbol for the letter ''Î''.<ref name="Angerthas">{{App|E2ii}}</ref> Other than in ''Nulukkizdîn'', it only appears in ''[[Khîm]]'' and ''Mîm'',<ref name="Ardalambion"/> the names of two Petty-dwarves.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the name is spelled ''Nulukkizdîn''; however, [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that in the original manuscript, his father used the spelling '''Nulukkhizdīn'''. It replaced an earlier spelling '''Nulukkhizidûn'''.<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, "[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]", "Of the Siege of Angband"</ref>

Tolkien's later notes on the origin of Nargothrond give a different Dwarvish name, '''Nar(u)kuthûn''', derived from a Dwarvish name of the [[Narog]], *''[[Naruka]]''. Tolkien includes the words "of Petty-dwarves" between parentheses behind the mention of its Dwarvish origin.<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}, page 47</ref> Whether Tolkien ever intended to replace ''Nulukkhizdīn'' with ''Nar(u)kuthûn'' is unknown.
