'''Eärnur''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: contraction of [[Eärendur (disambiguation)|Eärendur]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈarnur]}}; [[Third Age]] {{TA|1928|n}} – {{TA|2050|n}}) was the thirty-third and last [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]. He took the throne upon the death of his father [[Eärnil II]] in {{TA|2043}}, and after his disappearance, the [[Stewards of Gondor]] ruled in his name for many generations.

==History==
===Angmar===
During the [[Angmar War]], what was left of the ancient realm of [[Arnor]] was under attack. While not ignoring the North-Kingdom, King [[Eärnil II]] had trouble of his own, and could not spare any of his troops to send North. Upon learning that the Witch-king was preparing for the final blow in {{TA|1973}}, he sent his son Prince Eärnur north, as [[Captain of Gondor]]. Though his fleet sailed rapidly, he was not in time to save [[Arthedain]] or [[Arvedui]], its last king. His massive fleet - it filled [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]] and [[Forlond]] - was hailed by the Men that had survived the last defeat, and the [[Elves of Lindon|Elves]] also. To Gondor's standards, the expeditionary force was mediocre in size. It did, however, include cavalry from  [[Rhovanion]], which would prove useful on the wide lands of the North.

With [[Círdan]], Eärnur travelled East, and cleansed the lands of Orcs and other servants of Angmar. All fled before the might of the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], with Eärnur at its head. At the same time, [[Glorfindel]] came west from [[Rivendell]] and they [[Battle of Fornost|fought against Angmar]] at [[Fornost]]. When finally the Witch-king, clad in black, came forth near the site, many of the horses fled in terror. The Witch-king challenged Eärnur directly, but as he charged, his steed also swerved, and it took some time before the Captain of Gondor could regain control. The Witch-king laughed at this seeming retreat, but his victory would not last long. The Elves of Rivendell entered the battlefield, and the Witch-king fled before the [[Light of Valinor|might]] of Glorfindel. Fleeing in despair, Eärnur wanted to pursue him, but Glorfindel spoke against it: 

{{quote|Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.|Glorfindel<ref name="AA">{{HM|AA}}, "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"</ref>}}

But nonetheless, Eärnur bore a grudge against the wraith that disgraced him, and so he won the chief hatred of the Witch-king.

===Kingship===
It was soon found out that the Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and set up abode in Minas Ithil, which in consequence was renamed [[Minas Morgul]]. After the death of Eärnil and the coronation of Eärnur, the Witch-king challenged him to single combat, reminding him of the disgrace in the North. The [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]], [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], persuaded him not to go.

Seven years later, the Witch-king renewed his challenge, and this time, Eärnur could not be held back. Before leaving, however, Eärnur left [[Crown of Gondor|his crown]] on the lap of his father in the [[Hallows|Houses of the Dead]].<ref name="AA"/> There it was picked up again by [[Faramir]], the last Ruling Steward, for the coronation of [[Aragorn|Elessar]] almost a millennium later.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> With a small escort of knights, he rode past the gates of Minas Morgul. None were ever seen again.  

No new king was elected and the rule of Gondor passed to the [[Ruling Stewards]], beginning with Mardil Voronwë. The Stewards were to rule "until the King returns", because it was uncertain at first whether Eärnur had been killed or not. In addition, Eärnur left without a heir, and while many others in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, those claims generally had some sort of doubt, and no one wanted to risk another civil war like the [[Kin-strife]].<ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Eärnur'' is a shortened form of [[Eärendur (disambiguation)|Eärendur]]. It means "Servant of the [[Belegaer|Sea]]" in [[Quenya]], from ''[[Eär|ëar]]'' "sea" and ''[[-ndur]]'' "servant".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
Eärnur was a member of the "fifth line" of Kings of Gondor, which started with his father after the death [[Ondoher]] and his sons in {{TA|1944}}, and ended with himself a little over a century later.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:While explaining the origin of the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]] to [[Gimli]] (and by extension, the audience), [[Legolas]] refers to [[Isildur]] as the "Last King".<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', "[[Dwimorberg - The Haunted Mountain]]"</ref> Whether Eärnur was omitted on purpose (so not to introduce another name) or simply overlooked is unknown.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':''' 
:Eärnur appeared in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He came to Rivendell to aid the Elves and Men of Arnor.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Near the end of [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar|Epic Volume I: Shadows of Angmar]] the primary antagonist [[Mordirith]], the Steward of [[Angmar]], was revealed to have once been King Eärnur.<ref>{{VGC|SAXIV}}, Chapter 15 "The Doom of the North" [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271j-zRuZ6Q cut scene] (youtube)</ref> He was captured by the [[Witch-king]] upon entering [[Minas Morgul]] and turned into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] under the [[Nazgûl]]'s command. Under Mordirith, Angmar recovered enough to pose a threat to Eriador during the [[War of the Ring]]. Mordirith was long believed slain at the end of Epic Volume I, but returned as [[Gothmog]] months later in the game's storyline in an update that was released years later in real time. As the Battle of Pelennor Fields drew to a close, Aragorn banished Mordirith/Eärnur from the world.
