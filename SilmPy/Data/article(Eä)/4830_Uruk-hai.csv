The '''Uruk-hai''' were a new breed of [[Orcs]] that appeared during the [[Third Age]].

==Appearance==
They were faster than normal Orcs and could travel during the day without being weakened. They were not only faster but smarter, stronger and larger, though they were still shorter than Men. 

The Orcs and Uruks in the service of [[Barad-dûr]], the folk of Mordor, used the symbol of the Red Eye of [[Sauron]]. The Red Eye was also painted on their shields. At least one, a guard on the march with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], had a black knife with a long saw-edged blade, used by Pippin to cut through the ropes on his hands. 
They were all long-armed and crook-legged, not as tall as the [[Isengard|Isengarder]] Uruks but larger than the [[Moria]] Orcs. They could see better in the dark than the Isengarders could.

The Uruk-hai of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] used an S [[Cirth|elf-rune]] wrought in white metal on the front of their iron helms. It was clear this "S" stood for Saruman, because their shields had a small white hand (the symbol of Saruman) centered on a black field. [[Aragorn]] commented that their gear was not in the manner of other Orcs at all. Instead of curved scimitars, they used short, broad-bladed swords. Their great [[Bows|bows]] were made of yew wood, in length and shape as those of Men. They also appeared different physically: greater stature, swarthy, slant-eyed, thick legs and large hands. Although they did not like the light of the [[Sun]], they could withstand it better than other orcs. Saruman promised them man-flesh as a treat.

==History==
[[Treebeard]] openly wonders if they are Orcs that have been somehow "improved", or Men that were corrupted with Orc-like qualities, or if they were indeed a blending of Men and Orcs, an act which Treebeard considered to be "a black evil". 

The race of uruks, described as "black orcs of great strength", first appeared about {{TA|2475}} when they conquered [[Ithilien]] and destroyed the city of [[Osgiliath]]. These were evidently of Sauron's breeding, but it is not clear whether or not these uruks should be regarded as identical with the Uruk-hai, who could be a further 'improvement' to the race achieved by Saruman in the [[War of the Ring]].

The Uruk-hai made up a large part of [[Saruman]]'s army, together with the [[Dunland|Dunlendings]] and other [[Men|Mannish]] enemies of [[Rohan]], and similar large Orcs also served as the elite troops of [[Mordor]]. 

Saruman's army of Uruk-hai fought against [[Kings of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]] of Rohan and his people at [[Battle of the Hornburg|Helm's Deep]].

These Uruks of Mordor referred to Sauron as the Great Eye, and [[Grishnákh]] was their captain. 

He aided them with his wizardry as well: when Aragorn, [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]] followed the party of Uruks who kidnapped Merry and Pippin, Saruman's will caused weariness of the heart for the pursuers and lent speed to the Orcs. [[Uglúk]] led the Uruk-hai of Isengard, and since they were the strongest he felt that he led the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] march as well, insisting on going back by way of Isengard. This was the group that slew [[Boromir]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Uruk-hai'' has the element '''''uruk''''', which is a [[Black Speech]] word meaning "Orc".<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref><ref name=WJAC>{{WJ|AC}}, pp. 389-91</ref><ref name=L144>{{L|144}}</ref><ref name=PE17_47>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref> (For related words in other languages, see [[Orcs#Orcs in Tolkien's languages|Orcs in Tolkien's languages]].) The element ''[[hai|-hai]]'', also present in [[Olog-hai]] and [[Oghor-hai]], means "folk, people".

==Portrayal in adaptations==
In both [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]] and [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]], Uruk-hai are portrayed identically as (and without distinction to) the [[Orcs]]. 

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
[[File:War in Middle Earth - Orcs and Uruk-hai at Isengard.png|thumb|Uruk-hai at Isengard in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'']]
:The Uruk-hai are portrayed as figures with purple armor and a shield.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''

In [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings]], Saruman appears to be the only one who created the Uruks. They are shown in the movie as being released from a kind of membrane in the mud deep under Isengard (special commentary on the DVD edition explained that they were trying to base the scene on an early description of Tolkien's that Orcs "worm their way out of the ground like maggots"). In the movies Uruk-hai are described as a crossbreed between Orcs and "goblin-men". This is presumably a reference to the [[Goblin-men]] and [[Half-orcs]] in Saruman's service, creatures that blend the traits of Orcs and Men. These Uruks are sent after the Fellowship, and their leader is [[Lurtz]], a movie-only character.

His Uruks included Pikemen, Swordsmen, Archers, and [[Berserker|Berserkers]]. 
The Berserkers are the shock troops. When they were first spawned a helmet filled with blood was placed on their heads, so that they were filled with a bloodlust for their enemies. They carry doubly-bent swords, and forgo any armour in lieu of agility, slaying foes left and right, completely devoid of fear and pain. Pikemen, as the name suggests, carry long pikes, while archers carry [[crossbows]]. Swordsmen wield a straight iron sword, hooked at the tip, and deadly in an Uruk-hai's strong grip. They also use bladed shields, as seen in [[Amon Hen]] during [[Aragorn]]'s fight against Lurtz.

The Uruks were also very efficient using siege equipment, and had been trained to use crossbows with deadly accuracy. The Uruks, like the lesser Orcs, seemed to not care of each other's presence, shown by the battering ram wielders at Helm's Deep, barging each other off of the thin bridge. The Uruks also hated the Orcs, believing they were a lesser being and often rioting, e.g. in the tower of Cirith Ungol when Shagrat and Gorbag argued over Frodo's vest of Mithril and starting a mass war within the tower. The Uruks seem also to be able to control natural urges more than the Orcs, e.g. the Orcs demanded to eat the Hobbits they had captured, while the Uruks were protective. It would seem the only way Orcs were better than Uruks is in treachery, lying and being devious. The Uruks are also not seen to ever ride a mount, possibly due to size, weight and build (the Wargs which attacked the Rohan migration were ridden by trained Orcs).

'''2002: ''[[EA's The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Uruk-hai appear as enemies in the "Battle of Helm's Deep" and "Fangorn Forest" missions, retaining the movie appearance.
