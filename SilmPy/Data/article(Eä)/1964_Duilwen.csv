The '''Duilwen''' was one of the six rivers that flowed west through [[Ossiriand]] to meet [[Gelion]]. The Duilwen was the last-but-one of these to flow into the great south-flowing river; only the [[Adurant]] was further south.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
''Duilwen'' can probably be considered as a [[Sindarin]] name,<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Duilwen"</ref>  but was originally conceived as [[Ilkorin]] by [[Tolkien]], consisting of the Ilkorin elements ''duil'' ("river") and ''gwene'' ("green").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 355 (DUI-), 359 (GWEN-)</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com]|accessed=28 January 2013}}</ref> [[Helge Fauskanger]] has suggested that the element ''-wen'' is a "lenited and shortened form of ''gwene''".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ilkorin.htm|articlename=Ilkorin - a "lost tongue"?|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=28 January 2013}}</ref>
