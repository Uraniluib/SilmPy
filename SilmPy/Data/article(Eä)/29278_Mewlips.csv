'''Mewlips''' were a legendary race of evil creatures only mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse. The creatures were likely fictitious, although they could have been inspired by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}. p. 260</ref>

Living beyond the [[Merlock Mountains]] and the marsh of [[Tode]], they are said to have fed on passers-by, collecting their bones in a sack.<ref>{{AB|Mewlips}}</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Bilbo Baggins]] learned that the [[Long Marshes]] had grown wider, consuming paths and lost people.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>  In plot notes that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made while writing the story the raftsmen told tales of disappearing rafts, men, and beasts;<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, p. 362</ref>  [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests that the more ominous line in the notes may indicate that Tolkien had some unpleasantness in mind had [[Thorin and Company]] gotten into the marshes - perhaps meeting the Mewlips.<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, (ii) ''Visiting the Mewlips'', p. 370</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:''Mewlips'', described and given statistics in various supplements, are portrayed as undead beings living in swamps and marshes. The race is conceived as having been created by [[Morgoth]] in the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{ICE|8108}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8007}}</ref>
