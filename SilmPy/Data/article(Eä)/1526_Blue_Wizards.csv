The '''Blue Wizards''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] '''''Ithryn Luin''''') were two [[wizards]] sent to contest the will of [[Sauron]] in the furthest regions of [[Middle-earth]]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s conception of the two Blue Wizards changed dramatically between his earlier and later writings.

==History==
===Earlier writings===
The idea that there were two other [[wizards]] in addition to [[Gandalf]], [[Saruman]], and [[Radagast]] was first conceived when Saruman in his wrath revealed that there were five members of the Order of Wizards:
{{Blockquote|Later! Yes, when you [Gandalf] also have the Keys of Barad-dûr itself, I suppose; and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards|[[Saruman]]<ref name="TTVoice">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>}}

Nothing more was said of these two wizards in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as it was published. However, whilst preparing (in [[1954]]) an Index for ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Tolkien wrote what his [[Christopher Tolkien|son]] later referred to as the 'essay on the Istari'. There it is said that of the chief wizards who went to the North of [[Middle-earth]] there were five, and two of these were clad in sea-blue. Little was known about these two in the West of Middle-earth; even their individual names were unknown, but they were known collectively as ''Ithryn Luin'', the Blue Wizards. It is said they travelled into the East with [[Saruman|Curunír]] (Saruman) but they did not return into the West. Their fate was unknown, but some held that they fell into evil and became servants of [[Sauron]].<ref name="UTIstari">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

Tolkien expanded upon this last point in a letter written in [[1958]]: 
{{Blockquote|I really do not know anything clearly about the other two [wizards] – since they do not concern the history of the N[orth].W[est]. I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Númenórean range: missionaries to 'enemy-occupied' lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="Letter211">{{L|211}}</ref>}}

[[File:Tom Cross - Alatar - Darkness-slayer.jpg|thumb|Tom Cross - ''Alatar: Darkness-slayer''<ref group="note">Tolkien did not associate Alatar with Morinehtar (which means "Darkness-slayer") and they should not be considered synonymous.</ref>]]
Tolkien also suggests that only Gandalf returned to [[Valinor]]:
{{Blockquote|Wilt thou learn the lore <nowiki>||</nowiki> that was long secret<br/>of the Five that came <nowiki>||</nowiki> from a far country?<br/>One only returned. <nowiki>||</nowiki> Others never again|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="UTIstari"/>}}

In a brief narrative about a council of the [[Valar]], the origins of the Blue Wizards are placed alongside those of the other three, [[Saruman|Curumo]] (Saruman), [[Radagast|Aiwendil]] (Radagast), and [[Gandalf|Olórin]] (Gandalf). Whilst in the essay on the Istari the Blue Wizards are given no names, here they are called Alatar and Pallando. [[Oromë]] chose Alatar to send to [[Middle-earth]] (to contest the will of Sauron), and Alatar decided to bring along Pallando as his friend. Christopher Tolkien has speculated that their association with Oromë could be because he was the Vala who had the greatest knowledge of the furthest regions of Middle-earth and hence that is where the Blue Wizards journeyed.<ref name="UTIstari"/>
[[File:Angus McBride - Pallando.jpg|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Pallando''|thumb]]
Based on the above material, the history of the Blue Wizards can be determined as the following:
*[[Manwë]] summons a council of the [[Valar]]. They decide to send emissaries to [[Middle-earth]]. [[Oromë]] chooses to send Alatar, and Alatar brings along his friend Pallando.<ref name="UTIstari"/>
*The Blue Wizards arrive in Middle-earth at roughly the same time as the other wizards c. {{TA|1000}}<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref>
*The Blue Wizards travel into the East of Middle-earth with [[Saruman]]. Saruman returns to the North West, but the Blue Wizards do not.<ref name="UTIstari"/>
*Together or independent of each other, Alatar and Pallando fall from their appointed task. They may have founded 'magic' cults amongst the peoples of the eastern and southern regions, which existed beyond the downfall of the [[Sauron|Lord of the Rings]].<ref name="Letter211"/>

===Later writings===
[[File:Jef Murray - Slayer of Darkness.jpg|[[Jef Murray]] - ''Slayer of Darkness''|thumb|250px]]
Towards the end of his life Tolkien returned to the issue of the Blue Wizards. In a brief outline he noted that the Blue Wizards were sent to [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Second Age]] and were destined to disrupt the work of Sauron in the East:

{{Blockquote|Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of [[Men]] that had rebelled from [[Melkor]]-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [?dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]] in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="PMLast">{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-85</ref>}}

Therefore Tolkien dramatically altered his conception of the Blue Wizards. They no longer arrived in Middle-earth along with [[Saruman]], [[Gandalf]], and [[Radagast]] in c. {{TA|1000}}. Instead they arrived much earlier, at roughly the same time as [[Glorfindel]] in  c. {{SA|1600}}. Whilst Glorfindel was tasked with aiding [[Elrond]] with the war in [[Eriador]], the Blue Wizards were destined to journey to the East. Tolkien no longer believed that they drifted from their mission; instead he makes it clear that they played a decisive role in the downfall of Sauron at the end of both the [[Second Age]] and the [[Third Age]]. They became known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, Darkness-slayer and East-helper, and were successful in preventing the forces of the East from outnumbering those of the [[Free peoples]] in the West.<ref name="PMLast"/>

Based on these later writings, a history of the Blue Wizards can be summarised as the following:
*The two Blue Wizards were sent to Middle-earth at roughly the same time as [[Glorfindel]] in c. {{SA|1600}} (and similarly at the behest of the [[Valar]]), the Year of Dread, when Sauron forged [[the One Ring]] and completed the building of [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name="PMLast"/>
*The Blue Wizards journeyed into the East of Middle-earth, where they remained; they were not heard or seen of west of [[Mordor]].<ref name="PMLast"/>
*There they became known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, Darkness-slayer and East-helper.<ref name="PMLast"/>
*The Blue Wizards were able to hinder Sauron's operations in the East, aiding the defeat of [[Sauron]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref name="PMLast"/>
*During the early [[Third Age]] and until the end of the [[Watchful Peace]], they were tasked with finding where Sauron dwelt. They failed.<ref name="PMLast"/>
*Morinehtar and Rómestámo ensured that the forces of the East did not outnumber the West, thus helping secure victory for the [[Free peoples]] in [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="PMLast"/>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Ithryn Luin'' consists of ''[[ithron|ithryn]]'' ("wizards"; plural of ''ithron'') and ''[[luin]]'' ("blue").<ref name="UTIndex">{{UT|Index}}</ref>
<!--Etymologies needed for Alatar, Pallando-->

''Morinehtar'' is described as meaning "Darkness-slayer",<ref name="pome"/> likely based on the [[Quenya]] words ''[[mori-]]'' ("darkness") and ''nehtar'' ("slayer").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/quen-eng.rtf|articlename=Quenya-English Wordlist|website=[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf Ardalambion]|accessed=12-September-2012}}</ref>

''Rómestámo'' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌroːmeˈstaːmo]}}; or ''Róme(n)star'') is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "East-helper".<ref name="pome">{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-5, 391 (note 28)</ref>

:[[Gandalf]] mentions the Blue Wizards when he explains the number of Wizards, and says that he has forgotten their names.

:Since the film production team does not have the rights to include material from sources other than ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', the decision to include the line "Blue Wizards" (only appearing in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 244</ref>) has been regarded as legally controversial.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Janet Brennan Croft]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythsoc/message/23828|articlename=Source Material (message #23828)|dated=17 December 2012|website=[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythsoc/ MythSoc mailing list]|accessed=17 December 2012}}</ref>
