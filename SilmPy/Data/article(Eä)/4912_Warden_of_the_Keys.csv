At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the position was filled by [[Húrin (Warden of the Keys)|Húrin the Tall]], who gained the epithet "of the Keys". At the coronation of [[Aragorn]], he opened a barricade (laid in place of the destroyed gate) at the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|gatehouse of of Minas Tirith]] for the new king. Other than that, what other tasks and responsibilities belonged to this office remains unknown.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
