'''Grimslade''' was the ancestral home of [[Grimbold]], a lesser [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|Marshal of the Mark]]. Nothing is known of the location of this structure other that it stood in the [[Westfold]] of [[Rohan]].<ref name="Battle">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> The word "slade" seems to imply that the house was either in a clearing or on a hillside. 

==Etymology==
The name '''Grimslade''' is modernized from [[Old English]] ''Grimslaed'' representing [[Rohan language|Rohirric]].<ref name="RC">[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 571</ref>

It comes from ''[[Grim]]'', which Tolkien describes as "evidently the name of an ancestor", and ''slade'', "forest glade, dell on the slope of a hillside" widely used in English place-names.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref>
