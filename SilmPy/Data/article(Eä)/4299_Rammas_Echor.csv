The '''Rammas Echor''' was the great wall that surrounded the [[Pelennor Fields]]. It was one of the defensive works of [[Minas Tirith]].

==Description==
It was a great wall, over 10 leagues in length, encircling the hitherto defenceless townlands of the city. At its furthest point, it was four leagues from the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]]. There were three main gates to the Pelennor; north, east and south.<ref name="MT"/> The eastern gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the [[Causeway Forts]]<ref name="Siege">{{RK|V4}}</ref> and were the strongest section. It looked out over the road to [[Osgiliath]] and the banks of the [[Anduin]]. On the southern end, at [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]], the wall was only one league from the city.<ref name="MT">{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==History==
This outer defence-work of the city of Minas Tirith was built by [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] as part of the defences of [[Gondor]], which had become necessary after the final loss of [[Ithilien]] in {{TA|2954}}.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 546</ref> It fell in ruin but was repaired on the order of Steward [[Denethor|Denethor II]].

The Rammas was easily breached by the armies of [[Sauron]] under their [[Witch-king|Black Captain]] on [[13 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}. [[Denethor|Denethor II]] had put little guard on the Northern end,<ref name="MT"/> and the Causeway Forts were taken by the enemy at great loss.<ref name="Siege"/>

==Etymology==
''[[Rammas]]'' is [[Sindarin]] for "great wall". ''[[echor]]'' means "outer circle".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 512</ref> The name therefore means "Great-wall circle".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 325, entry "Rammas Echor"</ref>
