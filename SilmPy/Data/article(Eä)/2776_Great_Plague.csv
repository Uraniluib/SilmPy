The '''Great Plague''', also known as the '''Dark Plague''' was a disastrous pestilence that killed untold numbers of people, possibly up into the hundreds of thousands. The plague was brought by an evil wind from the east. It concided with a [[Shadow]] deepening in [[Mirkwood]], and the reappearance of evil things.<ref name="south"/>

The Great Plague began in the east beyond [[Mordor]] and hit [[Rhûn]] and  [[Rhovanion]], and after it had passed, more than half the folk of the Kingdom of Rhovanion had been killed<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>. 

It first reached [[Osgiliath]] in {{TA|1636}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> (just a couple of years after King [[Minardil]] of [[Gondor]] had been killed at [[Pelargir]] by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]). The new king, [[Telemnar]] was killed together with his kin, followed by the [[White Tree of Gondor]], as well as many others of the [[Dúnedain]]; two centuries after the [[Kin-strife]], this further destroyed the people of Gondor.<ref name="south">{{App|South}}</ref> 

The Plague also hit the enemies of Gondor, otherwise they could overwhelm the weakened kingdom easily.<ref name="south"/>

Osgiliath was especially hit hard, suffering the highest casualties outside of [[Rhovanion]]. Many fled the city and removed to [[Ithilien]] and [[Anórien]], and [[Minas Anor]] became the King's seat. The casualties were so high that the fortresses guarding [[Mordor]] were abandoned as the troops were recalled.<ref name="south"/> 

From there the plague spread west and then north. [[Dunland]] suffered less from the Plague than most due to their self-isolation.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>  However, the Plague regained strength as it went north, and [[Minhiriath]] (the southern part of [[Cardolan]]) was especially hit hard.  The joint garrison (of the North and South Kingdoms) at [[Tharbad]] ceases to exist.<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> The last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died on the [[Barrow-downs]], and evil spirits from [[Angmar]] and [[Rhudaur]] entered the realm.<ref name="north">{{App|North}}</ref>

While [[the Shire]] suffered greatly, the plague lessened passing northward until the northern part of [[Arthedain]] was scarcely affected.<ref name="north"/> Arthedain still defended [[Fornost Erain]] to the north.

The Plague marked the beginning of the desolation of [[Eriador]], that continued being depopulated from [[Men]] for the rest of the [[Age]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref> The exact date the plague ended is not known but for the next two centuries Gondor, as well as its enemies, did little but try and regain strength. Historians believed that the Plague was caused by Sauron since the [[Shadow]] deepened in [[Mirkwood]], foretelling his return in the (now unguarded) Mordor.<ref name="south"/>
