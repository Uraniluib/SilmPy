'''Bungo Baggins''' ({{TA|2846}} - {{TA|2926|n}}, died aged 80<ref name="Baggins">{{App|C1}}</ref>) was a well-to-do [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], and the father of [[Bilbo Baggins]].  Father and son were so much alike, in looks and behaviour, that Bilbo seemed like a "second edition" of his "solid and comfortable" father.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>

==History==
Bungo was the eldest child of [[Mungo Baggins]] and [[Laura Grubb]]. He married [[Belladonna Took]], daughter of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], towards {{SR|1290}}. Bungo and Belladonna had only one child together, the infamous [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref name="Baggins"/>

Apart from fathering Bilbo, Bungo's other achievements were that he built and excavated the rather luxurious [[Bag End]] in the [[Hobbiton Hill|Hill]] in [[Hobbiton]] and that he laid down several bottles of [[Old Winyards]] wine that would be enjoyed by [[Rorimac Brandybuck]] after [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]<ref name="Party"/> and by the small party on [[21 September]] {{TA|3018}} that [[Frodo Baggins]] gave before leaving Bag End.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

Bungo had an aptitude for either remembering or coining proverbs.  Bilbo quoted his father's sayings "third time pays for all" before making his first descent into [[Erebor]]<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> and "while there's life there's hope" when leading the Dwarves down to [[Smaug]]'s lair.<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Bungo'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Bunga''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
