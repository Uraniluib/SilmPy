'''Aulendur''', ([[Quenya|Q]]: "Servant of [[Aulë]]", pron. {{IPA|[a͡ʊˈlendur]}}), was a name used for those [[Noldor]], who actually entered Aulë's service, and who in return received instruction from him. [[Mahtan]] is the only one whose name we know. Tolkien first wrote this word as Aulendil.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 365-6, note 61</ref>
