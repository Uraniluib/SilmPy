'''Eithel Nínui''', also called the '''Fountain of Tinúviel''', was a fountain found on the plain of [[Tumladen]]. It is said to have been created by the tears of Lúthien falling down on the plain when she and Beren was flown over it by [[Thorondor]] and his vassals. Its water was recounted in song as having had healing powers until it was destroyed in the [[fall of Gondolin]].

==Note on occurrence==
The fountain and its legend is found in several of [[Tolkien]]'s drafts of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', but in the published version found in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' [[Christopher Tolkien]] omitted it. He has later admitted that this section should have remained in the published work.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 301</ref>
