[[Image:Vala.gif|left]]In its singular form the word ''vala'' is also the name in Quenya of the twenty-second letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.<ref name="Names">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref>  It is the second letter of the sixth grade or [[Tyellë]], which contains "semi-vocalic" consonants and it is the sixth letter in the labial or ''p''-series of consonants, the ''[[Parmatéma]]''.  In written Quenya, since ''[[Ampa]]'' (letter 14) is used for '''MP''', ''Vala'' is used for '''V'''.  In other modes (where ''Ampa'' is used for '''V''') ''Vala'' represents '''W'''.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>  However, in the [[Mode of Beleriand]] this letter represents '''M'''.<ref>{{App|Letters}}, footnote 2</ref>  The Westron name for this letter is '''''Wí'''''.<ref>See [[Westron Tengwar]]</ref>
