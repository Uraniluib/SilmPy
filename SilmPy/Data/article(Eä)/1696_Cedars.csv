'''Cedars''' were huge resinous trees with spreading branches. In the [[Third Age]], as today, cedars were most common in warmer lands, but they were apparently not unknown in [[the Shire]].  While in [[Ithilien]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] decided to rest near a bank crowned with old cedars.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>
