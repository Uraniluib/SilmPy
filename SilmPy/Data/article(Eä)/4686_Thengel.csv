'''Thengel the Thrice-renowned''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2905|n}} – {{TA|2980|n}}, aged 75 years) was the sixteenth [[King of Rohan]]. Thengel was the only son of [[Fengel]], and became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2953}}.<ref name="Mark"/>

==History==
Fengel was a greedy and quarrelsome man, and Thengel left Rohan in his youth to live in [[Gondor]], where he won great renown in the service of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]]. Eventually he met and married [[Morwen Steelsheen]] of [[Lossarnach]] in {{TA|2943|n}}, and he lived with her there for a while. Morwen bore him five children in total, including his only son (his second child) [[Théoden]] in {{TA|2948|n}} and a daughter [[Théodwyn]] in {{TA|2963}}, who would be the mother of [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]].<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

After Fengel died in {{TA|2953}}, Thengel was called upon to return to Rohan, which he reluctantly did. During Thengel's reign, a mysterious Northerner calling himself [[Thorongil]] entered his service, and rode with him for some time.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> [[Saruman]] took [[Isengard]] for himself and began to fortify it.<ref name="Mark"/>

Thengel had learned [[Gondor Sindarin|Sindarin]] while living in Gondor, and in his house it was the daily tongue, together with [[Westron]], the common speech. Even after his return, he continued to use Westron,<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> and [[Rohirric]] was not spoken by him or his heirs.<ref name="Mark"/>

==Etymology==
'''Þengel''' in [[Old English]] means "lord" and derives from ''þeġen, þegn''. This word is also related to [[Thain]].
