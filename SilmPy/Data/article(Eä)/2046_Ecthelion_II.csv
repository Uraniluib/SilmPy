==History==
Ecthelion was the son of Steward [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]]. A few years before he took the throne, [[Sauron]] had declared himself openly.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Ecthelion was known as a man of wisdom, who encouraged worthy men to enter into his service.  One who did so was the stranger [[Thorongil]], who fought for Gondor and severely damaged the [[Corsairs]]' fleet at Umbar in a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]].  It later transpired that Thorongil was [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> [[Gandalf]] was also a welcome guest in [[Minas Tirith]] at the time. Ecthelion also strengthened [[Pelargir]] and refortified [[Cair Andros]].<ref name="Elendil"/>

Ecthelion was followed by his son [[Denethor]] at his death in 2984.<ref name="South"/>
