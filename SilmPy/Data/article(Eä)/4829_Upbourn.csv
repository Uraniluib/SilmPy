'''Upbourn''' was a hamlet located in [[Rohan]], south of [[Edoras]] on the banks of the [[Snowbourn]] in the valley of [[Harrowdale]].<ref>{{RK|Muster}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name is a modernisation of the [[Old English]] ''Upburnan'' as would represent [[Rohirric]].<ref name="Nomen"/>

It derives from the fact that the hamlet was some way "up" the river Snowbourn.<ref name="Nomen"/>

As [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted, ''up-'' is used in English place-names for river-side villages (as [[wikipedia:Upavon|Upavon]] in [[wikipedia:Wiltshire|Wiltshire]]), especially in contrast to larger places near its mouth (as [[wikipedia:Upwey, Dorset|Upwey]] above [[wikipedia:Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]).<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 778</ref>
