The '''Variags''' were a little-known people who dwelt in the land of [[Khand]].

==History==
The Variags came from Khand, a little-known land southeast of [[Mordor]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> In the [[Third Age]] Khand was under the influence of [[Mordor]]; in {{TA|1944}} the Men of Khand together with the [[Haradrim|Southrons]] of [[Near Harad]] joined the [[Wainriders]] to attack Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

During the [[War of the Ring]] the Variags fought at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. They were held in reserve in [[Osgiliath]] along with armies of [[Easterlings]] and [[Southrons]]. After the death of the [[Witch-king]] they were sent onto the battlefield by [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. Their ranks were among [[troll-men]] and [[Orcs]] when the knights of [[Dol Amroth]] ran and drove them back.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Variag'' is unknown; it is, along with ''[[Oliphaunts|mûmak]]'' and ''[[Khand]]'', one of the few known words from the languages of the Men of the East and allies of Sauron.<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 79.</ref>

It is not clear if the word "Variag" is synonymous with the Men of Khand in general, or is a specific group or tribe of those men. The name appears only in context of the Battle of the Pelennor; the [[Appendix A|Annals of Kings and Rulers]] mention the Men of Khand who moved against Gondor in the Third Age, but the name Variags is not used.

==Inspiration==
[[Wikipedia:Variag|Variag]] is a Slavic word derived from [[Norse]] ''Varingar'' "mercenary people" (''vár'' "contract"). The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard Varangian Guard] were Norse body-guards of the Byzantine Emperor.

It has been suggested that Tolkien adopted the Slavic term to indicate that the Variags were possibly mercenaries serving a possible Lord of Khand.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Obscure Languages</ref>
