{{disambig-more|Húrin|[[Húrin (disambiguation)]]}}
The '''House of Húrin''' were the descendants of [[Húrin of Emyn Arnen|Húrin]] of [[Emyn Arnen]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] to King [[Minardil]] of [[Gondor]]. For this the House was also known as '''House of the Stewards'''. Húrin and his House were noted as being of high [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood, but they were not members of the [[House of Anárion|Royal House of Gondor]] itself.<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> 

After Húrin's time it became traditional for the Steward to be chosen from among his descendants, and in the time of [[Vorondil]] who succeeded his father, the Steward [[Pelendur]], the post became hereditary. Vorondil's [[Great Horn|horn]] became a hereditary heirloom, carried by the heir.

After the loss of [[Gondor]]'s last King, [[Eärnur]], the Stewards of the House of Húrin [[Ruling Steward|took up the rule]] of the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]]. That was until the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Faramir]], the heir of [[Denethor II]] became [[Prince of Ithilien]] and [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]], the lands of the House's patriarch.<ref name="Stewards"/>

It was customary in the House of Húrin to name sons after legendary figures of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 203</ref>
==The Family Tree of the House of Húrin ==
Showing the descendants of Húrin of Emyn Arnen:  First the hereditary Stewards of the Kings of Gondor, then the Ruling Stewards, and lastly the Princes of Ithilien (who again served as Stewards to the restored line of Kings).  All information in the tree is from Appendix A ("The Southern Line: Heirs of Anarion"<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> or "The Stewards"<ref name="Stewards"/>) or (mostly for dates of birth) ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'', "The Heirs of Elendil",<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> unless otherwise specified.  The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded.  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name preceded by '*' indicates one of the Ruling Stewards; an ''italicized'' name  denotes a [[Prince of Ithilien]].  A dashed line indicates marriage or a line of descent with some members missing.
