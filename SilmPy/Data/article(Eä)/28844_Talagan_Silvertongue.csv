'''Talagan Silvertongue''' was the lord of the Edhelion. In c. {{TA}} 2500 an alliance of [[Goblins]] and [[Dourhands]] attacked Edhelion to gain its relics under the leadership of [[Skorgrím Dourhand]]. Talagan sent messengers to [[Elrond]] of [[Rivendell]] for aid. Just before [[Elrond]]'s forces arrived, the [[Dourhands]] managed to break through Edhelion's defences and surrounded Talagan. In a last attempt to save Edhelion's relics Talagan destroys the entrance of the halls. The stones crush both Talagan and [[Skorgrím Dourhand|Skorgrím]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], [[Ered Luin Introduction|Introduction]], ''Instance: The Refuge of Edhelion''</ref>
