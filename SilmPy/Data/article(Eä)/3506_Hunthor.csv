'''Hunthor''' ({{FA|467}} - {{FA|499|n}}) was a [[Men|Man]] of the [[House of Haleth]], the kinsman of [[Brandir|Brandir the Lame]].

When [[Glaurung]] was approaching [[Brethil]], [[Túrin]] asked who of the Men of Brethil would come with him to attempt to kill the dragon.  [[Dorlas]] stepped forward immediately but when no one else volunteered he upbraided the lot of them, asking if none would take the place of Brandir so that the House of Haleth would not be put to shame.  Hunthor, kinsman to Brandir, rebuked Dorlas since Brandir's lameness was due to ill chance.  Hunthor then said he would go on behalf of Haleth's house.

Hunthor and Dorlas went with Túrin to [[Nen Girith]], where Túrin revealed his plan to climb down the [[Ravines of Taeglin]], cross the river, and ascend the other side so as to strike Glaurung's belly as he stretched across the gap.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>  Dorlas, who had deprecated the other Men of Brethil for lacking courage, could not bring himself to attempt to cross the rock-filled waters.  Thus only Túrin and Hunthor clambered up the west side of the ravine to make their attack.

Túrin and Hunthor were nearing the belly of the beast when the heat and stench of the dragon nearly caused Túrin to fall into the river, but Hunthor seized him and saved his life.  Túrin proclaimed Hunthor to be of "Great Heart!" but even at the moment a stone struck Hunthor's head and he was lost in the [[Taeglin]].<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
In ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' all that was said of Hunthor's family was that he was a kinsman of Brandir the Lame and thus a member of the House of Haleth.<ref>{{CH|16}}, p. 227</ref>  In "[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]", a story that appeared in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', Part Three (subtitled "Other Writings Not Forming Part of the ''Quenta Silmarillion''"), the relationship of Hunthor to Brandir (and other details of his family) was made clear.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 270</ref>  Women in the family tree are indicated by ''italic'' text.  The dagger symbol (†) shows those who died early (and childless) deaths (which indicates the ending of the House of Haleth).
