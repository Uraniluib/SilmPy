'''Hollin Ridge''' was a western outlier of the [[Misty Mountains]] roughly halfway between the [[Bruinen]] and the [[Sirannon]],<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> and about forty-five leagues south of [[Rivendell]].  The ridge was low, topped by ancient holly-trees, and marked the northern border of the long-lost Elven kingdom of [[Eregion]] (also known as Hollin).<ref name="South">{{FR|II3}}</ref>

On [[8 January]] {{TA|3019}}, the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] reached Hollin Ridge after a long night-march.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>  From its heights the travelers could see the [[Mountains of Moria]] in the distance.  They camped in a deep hollow beneath the ridge, which [[Aragorn]] re-climbed when he sensed the silence and watchfulness of the land.  After the ''[[Crebain]]'' flew over their camp the Fellowship remained in hiding near the ridge until they could leave under cover of night.<ref name="South"/>
