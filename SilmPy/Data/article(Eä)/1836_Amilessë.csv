'''Amilessë''', [[Quenya]] for "'''mother-name'''", was the name given to an elf at, or some years after, birth by his or her mother, and it was one of the Elf's true names.<ref name="names">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''Note on Mother-names'', p. 339</ref> It is one of the ''[[essë#anessi|anessi]]'', or given names, of [[High Elves]], along with the ''[[father-name]]''<ref>There is no attested Quenya term for this name, but we can conjecture it is ''ataressë''</ref> and ''[[epessë]]'' ("after-name" or honorific). 

The mother-name is a public name to an Elf and is quite significant because Elven mothers had insight into the characters and abilities of their children, and many also had the gift of prophetic [[foresight]].<ref name="names"/>

The most common type of mother-name is the ''amilessë tercenyë'' ("mother-name of insight"), given to the child as his or her personality began to develop, some years after birth. The ''amilessë apacenyë'' ("mother-name of foresight") was a more rare occurrence, given to the child from a vision of his or her special fate that the mother received in the hour of birth.<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, p. 216</ref>

For example ''Fëanáro'' ("Spirit of Fire") was the amilessë of [[Fëanor]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The case of the Quenya change of þ to s'', p. 333</ref> Other examples of amilessi include: [[Aracáno]] ("high chieftain"), [[Curufin|Atarince]] ("little father"), [[Tyelcormo]] ("hasty-riser").<ref name="names"/>
