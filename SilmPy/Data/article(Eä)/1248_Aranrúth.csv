'''Aranrúth''' was the sword of the [[Elves|Elven]] King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] in the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|21}}</ref>  Thingol apparently prized his weapon; when [[Beleg]] asked Thingol for a sword of worth for his quest to seek [[Túrin]], the King said he could have his choice of any except his own.<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 96</ref>  After his death the sword was passed on to his descendants and [[Elwing]] rescued it from the [[Second Kinslaying]]. 

[[Elros]], the first [[King of Númenor]] received it from his mother, and from there on it became an heirloom of the Kings of Númenor. It was lost in the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref>

==Etymology==
