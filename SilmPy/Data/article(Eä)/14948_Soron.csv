==Etymology==

This word derives from the [[Primitive Quendian|primitive]] '''þoronō'''<ref name="let">{{L|347}}, p. 426-7</ref> from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[THORON]] "eagle", an extension of the root [[THOR]] "come swooping down".<ref name="etym">{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''THOR'''</ref> In the development of Quenya words from [[Common Eldarin]], a short vowel that follows another vowel of the same quality was lost<ref name="let">{{L|347}}, p. 426-7</ref>, so that primitive ''þoronō'' developed into ''þorno'' and then ''sorno''.
