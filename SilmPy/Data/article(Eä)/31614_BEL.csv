__NOTOC__
'''BEL''', or '''MBEL''', is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "large".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, pp. 115, 150 (roots appearing as "BEL-, MBEL-", and "âˆšMELEK-")</ref>

It seems like [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] experimented with the form MELEK, signifying "great, mighty, powerful", when trying to devise an etymology for the name ''[[Morgoth|Melkor]]''. However, in what appears to be the later revision, ''Melkor'' was made a derivative of BEL, MBEL.<ref name=PE17/>

==Derivatives==

*[[Quenya]]: ''melek'' ("mighty"); ''melehta'' ("mighty"); ''melehte'' ("might, power (inherent)")<ref name=PE17/>
*[[Sindarin]]: ''[[beleg]]''; ''belaith'' ("mighty")<ref name=PE17/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] appears the root BEL-, signifying "strong".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 352</ref>
