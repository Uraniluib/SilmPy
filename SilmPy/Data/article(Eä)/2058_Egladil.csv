'''Egladil''', or the '''Angle''' in [[Westron]], was the name given by the [[Galadhrim|people of Lórien]] to their lands between the courses of the rivers [[Anduin]] and [[Celebrant]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref> A part of the [[Naith]], Egladil was the most populated part of the country, where the tree-city of [[Caras Galadhon]] was to be found.

A parting feast was held there when the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] departed [[Lothlórien]].<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]] (or [[Silvan Elvish]]) sometimes rendered into English as the "Angle". [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] gives the translation "Elven-point"<ref>{{HM|UI}}</ref> or, more accurately, "point (''[[til]]'') of the ''[[Eglath]]''".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier drafts to the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', the location was named ''Nelennas'' and ''Nelen'', sometimes glossed as "Gore", which was part of the larger ''Narthas''.

Other candidate, and more specific, names were ''Calennas'' and ''Calendil'', which is translated as "Green-tine" or "Green-spit".<ref>{{TI|Farewell}}</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes a confusing fluidity in how his father alternated the names and their meanings, regarding the larger "Angle" region between the rivers, and the specific "Tongue" at their confluence.<ref>{{TI|XIVviii}}, note 5</ref>
