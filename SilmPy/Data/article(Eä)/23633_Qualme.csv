'''Qualme''' is a [[Quenya]] term that refers to the natural "death" of the [[Elves]].

Although the Elves don't grow old, after the passage of millennia withered their bodies and "passed away" with their physical disappearance. 

Qualme may occur either naturally, or voluntarily by a weariness of life, due to a deep yearning.
