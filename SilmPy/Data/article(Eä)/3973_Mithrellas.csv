'''Mithrellas''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]] who, according the tradition of the House of [[Angelimir]], accompanied [[Nimrodel]] from [[Lothlórien]] on her journey to the southern havens. Mithrellas, it is said, became lost in the woods of [[Dor-en-Ernil]], where she was found by [[Imrazôr]] the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]], who married her. So [[Elvish]] blood entered the line of the [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Princes of Dol Amroth]], it was claimed, and her son [[Galador]] became the first of the long line of Princes. Mithrellas also bore Imrazôr a daughter, [[Gilmith]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 220-2</ref> After the birth, she ran away at night and was never seen again.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>
