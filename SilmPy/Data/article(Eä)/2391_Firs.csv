'''Firs''' were Evergreen trees that grew across the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]], and especially in the upper [[Vales of Anduin]].  On [[23 September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] encountered firs at midnight in the [[Green Hill Country]].  The hobbits made a fire of fir sticks and cones and slept in angles between a great fir-tree's roots.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>
