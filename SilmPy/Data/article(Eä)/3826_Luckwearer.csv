'''Luckwearer''' was one of several names and titles given to himself by [[Bilbo Baggins]] during his encounter with the dragon [[Smaug]]. Bilbo made these titles intentionally obscure and mysterious: 'Luckwearer' is a reference to the [[The One Ring|Magic Ring]] Bilbo wore, and his extraordinary good luck – as he thought – in finding it within the [[Orcs|Goblins]]' dark tunnels.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>
