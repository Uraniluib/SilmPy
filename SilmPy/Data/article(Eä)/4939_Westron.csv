The '''Westron''' was the [[languages|language]] of the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Middle-earth]]. By the end of the [[Third Age]] it was more or less a universal language spoken throughout the [[Westlands]]. 

[[Adûnaic]], and in turn Westron, was distantly related to other native languages of the Westlands, like those of [[Rhovanion]] and [[Rohan language|of Rohan]]; all descended from the [[Taliska|ancient languages]] of the [[Edain]].<ref name=lang/><ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 4</ref>
==History==
The Westron speech is derived from the [[Adûnaic]] tongue of [[Númenor]],<ref name="L144">{{L|144}}</ref> and originated as a creole language on the western coastlands of the continent of Middle-earth, when the Númenoreans established trade outposts and forts in the third millennium of the [[Second Age]]. From there, it spread to most of the westlands, with the notable exception of [[Mordor]].

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Faithful]] Númenoreans neglected their 'unfaithful' language in favour of [[Elvish]], allowing Adûnaic as spoken in [[Middle-earth]] to change and evolve chaotically among the [[Middle Men]]. But later it was enriched and softened under Elvish influence.
===Distribution===
Westron was adopted by [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]], mostly those living in the former areas of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and became their native language; it persisted even after the [[fall of Arnor]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref> [[Hobbitish]] itself was a rustic dialect of Westron. 

For this, Westron was also known as the '''Common Speech'''. [[Dwarves]] used Westron as a public language, as [[Khuzdul]] was private. Some [[Elves]] also spoke Westron, although some, like [[Haldir]]'s brothers didn't leave their lands much.<ref>{{FR|Lothlorien}}</ref> Even [[Orcs]] spoke Westron, which was the base of [[Orkish]] tongues.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref><ref name=lang>{{App|F1}}</ref> 

The [[Northmen]] also spoke Westron, such as [[Beorn]] and the [[Lake-men]].<ref>{{HM|H}}</ref> The [[Woses]],<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> the [[Dunlendings]]<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref> and the [[Rohirrim]] were examples of Men whose language was not Westron, but they spoke it in interlingual circumstances.<ref name=lang/> 

Under King [[Thengel]] of Rohan (who had lived in Gondor for many years before taking the throne), the Common Speech began to be used as the language of the court instead of their native [[Rohirric]] (thus [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], and [[Éowyn]] are all functionally bilingual in Rohirric and Common Speech) "though not all thought this a good thing..."{{fact}}

==Grammar==
Westron has both "deferential" pronouns, and "familiar" pronouns, but Hobbitish no longer possesses a [[wikipedia:T-V distinction|deferential pronoun]]. Westron had deferential pronouns for the second person (and sometimes the third person) but this had fallen out of use in [[Hobbitish]].

This lack of a deferential pronoun and universal use of the familiar pronoun is what [[Gondorians|Gondorian]]s are referring to when they repeatedly remark that Hobbit-speech sounds strange.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

==Etymology and names==

Westron is a translation of the original name '''''Adûni'''''<ref>{{PM|X}}, p. 316</ref> (cf. [[Adûnaic]] ''[[Adûn]]'' ("west")), and "Common Speech" translates the Westron term '''[[Sôval]] [[Phârë]]''',<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 6, p. 55</ref> of identical meaning. In [[Sindarin]] the language was called '''[[Annúnaid]]''' (Westron), or '''[[Falathren]]''' (Shore-language).<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, The Languages at the End of the Third Age, p. 32</ref>

==Translation==
According to Tolkien's fiction, Westron was the language spoken and understood by the protagonists of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name="L144" /> Many names of characters and places, in the book's "reality", were in Westron.

However, Tolkien mentions that Westron was presented as having been completely replaced by English in the text. This had certain important implications: first of all, proper names with derivations understandable or evident to speakers of Westron had been translated, to preserve the effect to the English reader. Thus, names like ''Baggins'', ''Bagshot Row'', ''Peregrin'', ''Rivendell'' et cetera, are not the ''actual'' names as spoken by the characters but are presented as ''translations''. 

Of course, outside the fictional context of the story, it is clear that there was no such "translation": the English names came first and the "original" forms in Westron or other languages were devised by Tolkien later.  
 
[[Rivendell]] ("cloven valley") was actually called ''[[Rivendell#Etymology|Karningul]]'', and [[Bag End]] was actually called ''[[Labin-nec]]'', after ''[[Baggins Family|Labingi]]'', the real form of [[Baggins Family|Baggins]].  In some cases the explanations became quite involved, such as the river Brandywine (Sindarin [[Baranduin]], "golden-brown river") was actually called ''[[Branda]]-[[nîn]]'', a punning Westron name meaning "border-water", which was later punned again as ''[[Bralda]]-[[hîm]]'' meaning "heady ale".

This logic went one step further by also presenting all [[Mannish]] languages akin to Westron in languages related to English, so that their "understandability" by the protagonists be simulated to the English reader.<ref name="L144" />

This utter replacement of Westron by English was taken so far that some sources that should give actual Westron have been turned to English too. For instance, in Moria, an illustration of the runic text on Balin's gravestone is given. The text is said to be written in both Khuzdûl and Westron. But while the first part of the inscription seems to really be a bit of Khuzdûl, the second part is actually plain English, just written in [[cirth]].

==Corpus==
The corpus of Westron is small; several of the Westron forms given above were not published in Tolkien's lifetime. Tolkien never worked out Westron to the same extent as [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] or even Adûnaic.

Many words come from [[Appendix F]] and the creation of it in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''. Additional information was published in [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' 17]] in [[2001]]. Even now, the corpus is very small.
