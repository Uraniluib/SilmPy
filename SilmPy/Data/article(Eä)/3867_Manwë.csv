'''Manwë Súlimo''' ([[Quenya]], pronounced {{IPA|[ˈmanwe]}}) was the King of the [[Valar]], husband of [[Varda]] Elentári, brother of the [[Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (Morgoth), and King of [[Arda]]. The winds, airs and birds were his servants. He was the greatest of the [[Ainur]] in authority, but not in power. The Lord of the Breath of Arda, he was appointed as its Ruler, hence his most common title, the '''Elder King'''.
==Attributes==
Manwë was the Ainu dearest to Eru, closest to his mind, and appointed his viceregent on Earth. He was king, lord of Arda, and ruler of everything that dwells therein. His spouse is [[Varda]], and they are seldom parted. His attributes are air and the winds, from the [[Veil of Arda]] to the small breezes and he commands the birds.<ref name=vala/> From the beginning [[Ulmo]] has been his closest friend and ally and they come together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.<ref name=ai/> 

He lived in [[Ilmarin|his halls]] atop Mount [[Taniquetil]], the highest mountain of the world. Together with Varda he could see farther than all other eyes. All things that flew in the light were his servants and brought him news from the farthest and deepest places of the world; save dark places in the deep that were Ulmo's domain<ref name=vala/> or those hid by the black thought of powerful evil.

As the vicegerent of Eru on Earth, Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power. Manwë dressed in blue robes and had blue eyes. He wielded a scepter of sapphire made for him by the [[Ñoldor]]. The [[Vanyar]] were his favorite Elves, and they lived with him and Varda on Mount [[Oiolosse]], and he delighted in their songs and poetry.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref>

==History==
In the thought of Ilúvatar Manwë was the brother of Melkor, but dearest to Ilúvatar and the one that best understood the will of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]].<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> When Melkor created the discord in the second [[Song of the Ainur]], Manwë took over leading the song, pondering about airs and winds.<ref name=ai>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> 

Manwë along with [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]] were the chief architects of [[Arda]] and when it was formed, he denied to surrender it to Melkor, and many [[spirits]], like [[Varda]], came to his side from the deeps of [[Ea]].<ref name=ai/>

But he did not understand evil, even in the form of his own brother. He released Melkor from [[Mandos]], thus allowing him to cause the distrust of [[Fëanor]], the [[Darkening of Valinor|Poisoning]] of the [[Two Trees]], the murder of [[Finwë]], the theft of the [[Silmarils]], and the revolt of the [[Noldor]]. 

To hearten the [[Eldar]], he had [[Aulë]] fashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the [[Atani]] was coming soon, and sent [[Thorondor]] and the [[Great Eagles]] to watch them. 

After Morgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the [[Void]]. In the [[Final Battle]], when Melkor escapes, it is said that the Elder King and the Dark Lord will battle on the Plains of [[Valinor]], but that they will not slay each other.

==Etymology==
''Manwë'' is intended to mean "Blessed One" in [[Quenya]], from [[root]] ''MAN'' plus the male ending ''[[-wë]]''. However it is said also to be a version of the [[Valarin]] name [[Mānawenūz]]. 

From the same root, the ''[[Etymologies]]'' give another epithet, '''Kalamando''' (light Mando), being the light counterpart of [[Mandos|Morimando]] (Dark Mando).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry MBAD</ref>

''[[Súlimo]]'' is an epithet meaning "Breather",<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> with the [[Sindarin]] form ''Thū''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 124</ref>  His titles include ''Elder King'',<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> ''High King of Arda'',<ref>{{S|9}}</ref> ''King of Arda'',<ref>{{S|2}}</ref><ref>{{S|7}}</ref> ''Lord of the Breath of Arda''<ref name=vala/><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>.

His name in [[Sindarin]] is ''Aran Einior'', "Elder King"<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> and in [[Adûnaic]] ''Amân''.<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Manwë is referred to as ''Wolcenfréa'', consisting of ''wolcen'' ("sky"; cf. [[Wikipedia:Modern English|Modern English]] "[[Wikipedia:Welkin|welkin]]") + ''fréa'' ("ruler").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 208</ref>

In an early manuscript called "Valar name-list", Manwë has the additional [[Qenya]] names '''Taimo''' (masculine form of ''Taime'', "the sky") and '''Valtur''' ("King of the Valar").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 12</ref>

==Inspiration==
Compared to real mythologies, Manwë represents possibly a [[Wikipedia:sky father|sky father]] like [[Wikipedia:Zeus|Zeus/Jupiter]] of the Greco-Roman mythology. Like Zeus, Manwë is both a [[Wikipedia:Sky deity|sky "deity"]] and a [[Wikipedia:King of the Gods|leader of his pantheon]] and is associated with the [[eagle]].
