{{disambig-more|Hope|[[Hope (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Amdir''' was a [[Sindarin]] word literally meaning "looking up". It was used to describe a concept similar to the ideas of "hope" or "optimism". ''Amdir'' is more closely defined in the ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]'' as "an expectation of good, which though uncertain has some foundation in what is known". ''Amdir'' was often contrasted with ''[[Estel (philosophical concept)|Estel]]'', which is a more deeply grounded type of hope.<ref>{{MR|P4c}}</ref>
