'''Maglor''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈmaɡlɔr]}}) was the second of the [[Sons of Fëanor]].  He had more of his mother [[Nerdanel|Nerdanel's]] gentle spirit than any of his brothers.  Maglor was known for his [[Minstrels|poetry and singing]],<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> but in [[Tirion]] he swore the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and shared in the woes it bred.<ref name="Flight">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

==History==
Maglor was present at the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. To what degree he participated in the slaughter is unknown but later he composed the lament ''[[Noldolantë]]'', the Fall of the [[Noldor]], in memory of the terrible event.<ref name="Flight"/>  Following [[Fëanor]] into exile, Maglor witnessed his father die after he had fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Wife of Maglor|125px]]The sons of Fëanor settled in the eastern part of [[Beleriand]].  Maglor's ward was the opening in the hills between the two arms of the [[Gelion]] River which acquired the name of '''[[Maglor's Gap]]'''.  Due to the lack of hills the Gap was a natural route for attacks from the north and the Noldor kept a strength of cavalry in that region.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

Maglor's Gap was held for four and a half centuries.  However, in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] invaded and laid waste to Maglor's land, forcing Maglor to flee to the fortress of his brother [[Maedhros]] on the hill of [[Himring]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Sixteen years later, he and Maedhros marched to the great battle that the [[Elves]] hoped would see their revenge upon [[Morgoth]], but they were defeated, partly by the treachery of [[Uldor the Accursed]]. Maglor himself slew Uldor, but all of the sons of Fëanor were wounded and they were forced to retreat to [[Mount Dolmed]]. The heavy loss led to the name of the battle thereafter: the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or the "Battle of Unnumbered Tears".  Maglor and his brothers took to a wild woodland life in [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Prior to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, one of the three [[Silmarils]] had been recovered from [[Iron Crown|Morgoth's Crown]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>  From his parents [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] received the jewel and brought it to [[Doriath]]. True to their oath, the sons of Fëanor (led by [[Celegorm]]) demanded the Silmaril. When Dior refused to surrender it the brothers assaulted Thingol's ancient kingdom. [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]] and [[Curufin]] all fell, as did Dior and his wife, [[Nimloth of Doriath]]. But the four remaining brothers - Maglor, Maedhros, Amras and [[Amrod]] - did not recover the Silmaril for [[Elwing]], the daughter of Dior and Nimloth, escaped.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

Eventually the three brothers heard tiding that [[Elwing]] possessed a Silmaril and dwelt at the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Driven by their Oath, the remaining sons of Fëanor made a sudden attack upon the refugees of [[Gondolin]] and Doriath. However they were again thwarted for Elwing escaped with the Silmaril across the [[Belegaer|Sea]] to her husband [[Eärendil]].  Together they sailed into the [[Aman|West]] and their voyage would eventually cause the downfall of Morgoth.  Meanwhile, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], Eärendil and Elwing's sons, captured in the battle, were adopted by Maglor, and it is said that love grew between them.

After Morgoth's fall the last two Silmarils were recovered from his Crown. By this time, only Maedhros and Maglor remained of Fëanor's sons.  In weariness and loathing they demanded the jewels from [[Eönwë]], the herald of [[Manwë]]. Eönwë refused them the Silmarils due to their many evil deeds. Still driven, the two brothers crept into the camp of Eönwë and stole the jewels. Though they were caught Eönwë let them depart. Maedhros and Maglor each took one jewel but their evil deeds caused the holy Jewels to burn their skin. Maedhros in despair cast himself into a fiery fissure.  Maglor, the last surviving son of Fëanor, threw his Silmaril into the Sea. Legend says that he still wanders the shores of the World, singing laments for his despair and regret.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
His [[father-name]] was '''''Kanafinwë''''', a name which in [[Quenya]] means "Strong-voiced [of] [[Finwë]]". It is derived from ''[[káno]]'', a noun which means "commander", added to the name of his grandfather.<ref>{{PM|Feanor}}, p. 352</ref> His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Makalaurë]]'''''. In [[The Etymologies]] it is interpreted as "Gold-cleaver".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''MAK-'''</ref> A possible explanation for this translation is given in [[The Shibboleth of Feanor]], where it is stated that the name might be a reference to his skill in harping, whose sound was golden.<ref>{{PM|Feanor}}, p. 353</ref>
