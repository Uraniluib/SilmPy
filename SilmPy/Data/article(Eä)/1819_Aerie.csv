'''Aerie''' was an almost certainly mythical [[Elves|Elven]] realm probably invented by [[Bilbo Baggins]] for his poem [[Errantry]] where Aerie's Elven-knights dared a mariner.<ref>{{ATB|Errantry}}</ref> The name is obviously fictional, made to resemble an [[Elvish]] one.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry Aerie</ref>
