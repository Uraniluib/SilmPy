'''Narya''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈnarʲa]}}), the '''Ring of Fire''' or '''Red Ring''', was one of the [[Rings of Power]], specifically one of the "[[Three Rings]] for the Elven Kings under the sky".

==History==
Created by [[Celebrimbor]] after ''Annatar'' had left [[Eregion]], it was free of Annatar's ([[Sauron]]'s) influence due to the fact that the Elves hid their three rings from him upon discerning his intent, but it was still bound to [[the One Ring]]. According to ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', at the start of the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] Celebrimbor gave Narya together with the Ring [[Vilya]] to [[Gil-galad]], High King of the [[Noldor]]. Gil-galad entrusted Narya to his lieutenant [[Círdan]], Lord of the Havens of [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]], who kept it after Gil-galad's death.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Gil-galad receives only Vilya, while Círdan receives Narya from the very beginning. In the [[Third Age]] Círdan gave the ring to [[Gandalf]] for his labours.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> It is described as having the power to inspire others to resist tyranny, as well as (in common with the other Three Rings) hiding the wielder from remote observation (except by the wielder of the One) and giving resistance to the weariness of time:

{{quote|Take this ring, master," he said, "for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself. For this is the Ring of Fire, and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill.|[[Círdan]] the Shipwright}}<ref name="TA"/>

==Etymology==

The name ''Narya'' is [[Quenya]], deriving from the elements ''[[narwa]]'' "fiery red"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry "NAR<sup>1</sup>"</ref>  + ''[[-ya]]'' (adjective suffix).{{fact}}
