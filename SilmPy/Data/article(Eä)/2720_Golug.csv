'''Golug''' was a word from a language of the [[Orcs]], whose only recorded use was during the later [[First Age]], used to describe the Deep Elves (the [[Noldor]]). Its origins are unknown, but it may be related to the [[Sindarin]] name for this same people, [[Golodhrim]].<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 111</ref>
