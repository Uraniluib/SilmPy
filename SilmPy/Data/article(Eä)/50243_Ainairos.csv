'''Ainairos''' was an [[Elf]] of [[Valinor]]. He was one of the [[Solosimpi]] that escaped the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|kinslaughter at Alqaluntë]] in which his brother was killed.<ref name="Ainairos">{{LT1|IX}}, p. 234</ref>

As the result of this, he, along with many of his people, became bitter and resentful of the [[Noldoli]]. When [[Manwë]] summoned the [[Valar]] and the [[Eldar]] to a council, Ainairos was the one to speak against the Exiles and for the concealment of Valinor, and the most that were gathered there agreed with him, desiring neither [[Melko]] nor the Noldoli to return.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 234-235</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
The character was originally named '''Oivárin''' before being changed to Ainairos.<ref>{{LT1|IXn}}, p. 250</ref>
