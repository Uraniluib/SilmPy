'''Bears''' were large and ferocious animals, notorious for their love of honey.<ref>{{HM|TT}}, "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]"</ref>

==History==
Bears lived in the [[Misty Mountains]] for some time, though by the late [[Third Age]], their number had diminished. [[Gandalf]] told [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] that [[giants]] had taken up their homes in that mountain range. One of the alleged origins of [[Beorn]], the skin changer, was that he had descended from them.<ref name="Queer">{{HM|H}}, "[[Queer Lodgings]]"</ref> 

==Etymology==
Early [[Noldorin]] had two words for ''bear'': ''[[brôg]]''<ref name="morok">{{HM|LR}}, "[[The Etymologies]]", entry [[MOROK]]</ref> and ''[[megli]]'' (with the variation ''[[meglivorn]]'' "Black bear")<ref>{{HM|LR}}, "[[The Etymologies]]", entry [[LIS]]-</ref> In [[Sindarin]], only the word ''[[graw]]'' is attested,<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 12 (note 3)</ref> though [[Didier Willis]] also suggested the "updated" word ''Medli''.<ref>[[Didier Willis]], ''[[Elfling]]'', [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/4007 message 4007]</ref> A [[Quenya]] word for "bear" is given as ''morco'', sharing a [[Sundocarmë|Root]] with ''brôg''.<ref name="morok"/> A variant Quenya name for "bear" is given as ''morokō'' (and ''mor(o)kē'', "she-bear").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 82</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest outlines of ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', [[Tuor]] was clad in the skins of bears.<ref name="Fall">{{LT2|III}}</ref> The sinews of bears were also used to make bowstring<ref>{{HM|LB}}, "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]", line 1073 (page 47)</ref> and harp strings.<ref name="Fall"/>

==Other fiction==
Bears play a significantly bigger role in other stories, most notably ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''. 
* The former included three mischievous bears [[Archie]], [[Teddy]] and [[Bruno]], who more resemble teddybears in Tolkien's drawings.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', page 13</ref> 
* The [[North Polar Bear]] helped [[Father Christmas]] writing his letters by making side comments. Other polar bears were [[Paksu]] and [[Valkotukka]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Baillie Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]''</ref>
