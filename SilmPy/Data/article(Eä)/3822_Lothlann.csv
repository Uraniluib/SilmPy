'''Lothlann''', a "wide and empty" plain,<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> lay to the east of [[Ard-galen]] and north of [[East Beleriand]], beyond the [[March of Maedhros]] and [[Maglor's Gap]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> 

In the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the riders of the people of [[FÃ«anor]] were overwhelmed in Lothlann when the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] came and passed through [[Maglor's Gap]]. Many of [[Maglor]]'s cavalry were burnt alive on the plain as [[Morgoth]] set fire to it.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

As with most of [[Beleriand]], it was drowned by the [[Great Sea]] at the end of the [[First Age]].
==Etymology==
The name means "empty and wide". In ''[[The Etymologies]]'' the name is identified as [[Noldorin]] and spelled ''Lhothlann'' according to the earlier conception, with the "Lh" later being dropped in favour of "L" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|articleurl=http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/lh-rh.htm|articlename=On LH and RH}}</ref> It is derived from the Noldorin elements ''lhost'' "empty" and ''lhand/lhann'' *"wide".

In that document the name appears both as ''Lhothland'' and ''Lhothlann'', but under the entry LUS it also appears in its later form '''''L'''othlann''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries [[LUS]], [[LAD]]</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In early drafts of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', the name Lothland desert, also [[Desert of Lostladen]], was to be a region south of [[Mordor]].
