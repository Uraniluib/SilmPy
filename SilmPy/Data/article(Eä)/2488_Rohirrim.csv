The '''Rohirrim''', or the '''Horse-lords''', were a horse people, settling in the land of [[Rohan]], named after them. The name Rohirrim was mostly used by outsiders: the name they had for themselves was '''Eorlingas''', after their king [[Eorl the Young]] who had first brought them to Rohan.

The terms '''Riders of Rohan''' and '''Riders of the Mark''' are commonly used and refer specifically to their mounted soldiers. The '''King's Riders''' were specifically the Riders who formed the bodyguard of the King.
==History==
The ancestors of the Rohirrim were [[Northmen]] known as the '''[[Éothéod]]'''<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>. Those were descendants of the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]]. They did not go to [[Beleriand]] like the Edain who were later rewarded with the island of [[Númenor]] by the [[Valar]].<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> 

According to some simplified views in [[Gondor]] however, the Rohirrim were perhaps directly descented from the [[House of Hador]], perhaps [[Hador]] or his sons.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref> This belief was accepted by the Rohirrim themselves and strengthened their friendship with Gondor, and it comforted the Númenorean pride of the [[Gondorians]], who surrendered a large part of their kingdom to them.<ref name=atani/><ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #61</ref>

The Éothéod were a race of [[Men]] that lived in the vales of the Great River [[Anduin]], but that removed to [[Calenardhon]] which was granted them in perpetuity by the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]], [[Cirion]] in reward for the assistance that they offered Gondor at a time of great need, the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]].

Later Calenardhon was renamed [[Rohan]] (''Horse-land'') by the [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Hallas]] after their many horses. By the Rohirrim themselves Rohan was usually called '''[[The Mark]]'''.

The [[Dúnedain]] of Gondor believed that the Rohirrim were distantly related to them (having descended from the [[Atanatári]] of the [[First Age]]) and described them as ''[[Middle Men]]'', that being inferior to the [[Númenóreans|High Men]] in both culture and descent, but superior to the ''[[Men of Darkness]]'' who had worshipped and served [[Sauron]].

However, this was a piece of Númenórean fiction meant to satisfy the national pride of the people of Gondor for the surrender of the territory of Calenardhon.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:John Howe - Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Rohirrim'']]
The Rohirrim were tall, blond, and mostly had blue eyes. They prized their horses more than anything, and their entire culture was based around these. They had few cities, but lived in many villages on the plains of Rohan. 

:''They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. '' &#8212; [[The Lord of the Rings]]: The Two Towers

==Culture==
The Rohirrim had had contacts with [[Elves]] in their ancient history, and knew of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], but like the Dúnedain they did not worship him in any temples. They seem to have valued the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Oromë]] the Hunter highly, whom they called [[Oromë#History|Béma]]. 

They measured time with a calendar that came from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] and had apparent similarities to the [[Shire Calendar|Calendars of the Shire]] and [[Bree Calendar|Bree]], and to that of the [[Dale]].<ref>{{App|D1}}</ref> These similarities were noted by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] in his work ''[[Reckoning of Years]]''.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

They were ruled by a line of kings descended from Eorl the Young, who had first brought them to Rohan, and in time of war all able men rode to meet the Muster of Rohan.
===[[Horses]]===

The Rohirrim are famous as skilled horsemen, masters and breeders. Among the horses of the Rohirrim are the famed [[Mearas]], the noblest and fastest horses who have ever roamed [[Arda]]; [[Shadowfax]] was the greatest of all Mearas.  There were very few Mearas left in Middle-earth at this point, but there were enough that a breeding population was present.  The armies of Rohan are almost exclusively cavalry, divided into irregular units termed [[éoreds]].  Rohan's armies were more of a very well trained militia called upon in times of war, with the actual standing army relatively small.  The professional career-soldiers of Rohan may have been limited to the royal bodyguard at Edoras.

It was because of this close affiliation with horses, both in war and peace, that they received their now famous name. ''Rohirrim'' (or more properly ''Rochirrim'') is [[Sindarin]] for "Horse-lords," and ''Rohan'' (or ''Rochand'') meant "Land of the Horse-lords." These names were devised by Hallas, son of Cirion the Steward.

During the early days of the [[War of the Ring]], rumours were spread that the Rohirrim supplied Sauron's armies with horses. These rumours were obviously false: the Rohirrim valued their horses more than anything and would never send them away, even as tribute.  Still these rumours had some effect in that they obscured the fact it was Saruman who had fallen, rather than Rohan.  The basis of the rumour was that Sauron's [[Orcs]] on raids into Rohan stole their horses for use in Mordor's army, but this was outright theft that angered the Rohirrim against Sauron.

===Language===
{{main|Rohirric}}
The Rohirrim spoke a language descended from that of the [[Éothéod]], related to that of the [[Northmen]] of  [[Rhovanion]]. In comparison to [[Westron]], it was mostly archaic and was not easily understood by the speakers of Westron.

The lords of the Rohirrim used [[Westron]] freely, in the gracious, noble and antique manner of the [[Gondorians]].<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>

The Rohirrim wrote with a [[Mannish]] version of the [[cirth]], although they did not have a literature, preferring oral tradition.
