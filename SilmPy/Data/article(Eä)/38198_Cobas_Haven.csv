'''Cobas Haven''' was an inlet that opened onto the [[Bay of Belfalas]] between [[Anfalas]] to the north and the promontory of [[Dol Amroth]] to the south.  The river [[Morthond]] (with the gathered waters of the [[Ciril]] and the [[Ringló]]) emptied into Cobas Haven from the northeast.<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, West, p. 434</ref>

==History==
The haven of [[Edhellond]], southwest of the confluence of the Morthond and Ringló, had been established by Sindarin Elves who had fled [[Beleriand]] in the [[First Age]].  In the [[Second Age]] the [[Númenóreans]] found the shores of the Bay of Belfalas uninhabited except for the small settlement of [[Elves]] still living in this haven.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 247</ref>  The last of these Elves departed in {{TA|1981}}.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 6, p. 214</ref>  In order to reach the open ocean, all of the departing Elves would have had to traverse the waters of Cobas Haven.

==Etymology==

[[Christopher Tolkien]] has suggested that his father derived the name ''Cobas'' from [[Qenya]] ''[[kópa|Kópas]]'' ("Haven").<ref>{{TI|MIII}}, Note 10, p. 322</ref>
