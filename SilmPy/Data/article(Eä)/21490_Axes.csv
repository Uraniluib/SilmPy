'''Axes''' were tools for chopping wood and excellent mêlée weaponry, usually associated with [[Dwarves]], but not exclusively used by them.

==History==
When the threat of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] started to loom over [[Valinor]], there was unrest among the people of [[Fëanor]]. So they came to smithing weaponry. The [[Noldor]], renowned steelwrights, crafted sword, spears and axes.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> Dwarves also made axes; their (doomed) alliance with [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] made them trade many fine axes, swords and spears with the King of the [[Sindar]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Axes would remain to be the main weapon of the march wardens of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> and were also used by their allies, the [[House of Haleth]] in [[Brethil]].<ref name="5B">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> 

==Axes by Faction==
* '''The [[Dwarves]]''' had the axe as their chief weapon. Dwarven warriors would carry at least one standard axe, though sometimes carried backup weapons as well.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> The [[Dwarves of Belegost]] and their lord, [[Azaghâl]], bore axes.<ref name="5B"/> Axes were also used during the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. Durin had a [[Durin's Axe|legendary axe]],<ref name="journey">{{FR|Journey}}</ref> [[Gimli]] bore one,<ref name="South">{{FR|South}}</ref> and [[Dáin Ironfoot]] had a red axe.<ref name="Quest">{{UT|Quest}}</ref>

* The '''Forces of Darkness''' were known to use axes in combat. [[Orcs]] and [[Balrogs]] used it as a weapon in battles. [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], the Lord of Balrogs himself bore a black axe.<ref name="5B"/> During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] [[Easterlings]] wielded great axes, and were among the most effective forces of [[Minas Morgul]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

* '''The [[Númenóreans]]''' were passed the craft of weaponsmithing by the [[Noldor]], and they managed to forge great axes. Their main purpose seems to have been not in war, but in deforesting the woods of [[Middle-earth]] for ship-timber.<ref name="Description">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

*Among '''the [[Atani]] of the First Age''', the most notable axe-bearers are probably [[Huor]] and [[Tuor]], whose axe was called [[Dramborleg]]. The Men of [[Brethil]] carried little weaponry, but mostly axes.
