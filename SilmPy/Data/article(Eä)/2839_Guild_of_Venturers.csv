The '''Guild of Venturers''' was a guild of mariners and seamen formed by the great [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] adventurer [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] in the year {{SA|750}}.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Notes, ''Chronology''</ref> The Guild had no fixed guildhouse on land, but was based instead on the ship ''[[Eämbar]]'', that had been built for the purpose. ''Eämbar'' was sailed at times to different harbours of [[Númenor]], but was normally anchored off the island of [[Tol Uinen]] in the bay of [[Rómenna]]. The sailors of the Guild went much farther than this, though, steering their vessels east across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to the distant shores of [[Middle-earth]]. There, they visited [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]], and explored the coastlands into the far south.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
