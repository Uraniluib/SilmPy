'''Lothlórien''' was a kingdom of [[Silvan Elves]] on the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]]. It was considered one of the most beautiful and "elvish" places in [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Third Age]], and had the only [[mallorn]]-trees east of the [[Belegaer|sea]].

==History==
===First Settlers===
The first inhabitants of the forested area later known as Lórien were a group of [[Nandor]] that refused to cross the [[Hithaeglir]].<ref>{{UT|6a}}</ref> Lórien was probably one of their scattered settlements in the area. Later, however, as the power of the [[Longbeards]] of [[Moria]] grew, they relocated to the eastern side of the [[Anduin]], across the [[Nimrodel]]. The land in which they dwelt (the forest east of the Hithaeglir, above [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] and below [[Mirkwood]]) became known in the [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan tongue]] as ''[[Lórinand]]'', or ''Laurelindórenan''.

===The Sindarin Dynasty===
After the [[War of Wrath]], [[Sindar]] came from the deluge of [[Beleriand]] in the West. Their migration was a great boost to the power and culture of the Nandor. Their language was replaced by [[Sindarin]]. The arrival of the Sinda [[Amdír]] affected the Nandor of Laurelindórenan. He took over as their King, while another Sinda, [[Oropher]], became king of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]].<ref name=Sindarin>{{UT|6b}}</ref>

[[Celeborn]], a Sindarin elf, dwelt with his [[Noldor]]in wife [[Galadriel]] in [[Eregion]]. They made contact with the Nandor of Lórinand, and before long they passed through [[Moria]] and arrived in the woods. After the Fall of Eregion and the death of [[Celebrimbor]], [[Nenya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, was delivered to Galadriel.<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

As [[Sauron]]'s power grew over the [[Westlands]], King Amdír marshaled the [[Elves]] of Lórinand to the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. His division was cut off from the main body during the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and many of the Nandor went down into the [[Dead Marshes]] with their King.<ref name=Sindarin/>

The survivors of the battle, which included Amdír’s son [[Amroth]], returned to Lórinand. Amroth was the new King, but he was tired of Middle-earth, and wished to go West and seek [[Valinor]]. When Moria fell to evil in {{TA|1981}}, many of the Lórinand elves fled south. Around that time Amroth departed to [[Edhellond]] with his beloved, [[Nimrodel (Elf-maid)|Nimrodel]]. The Nandor never saw either of them again.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

===The Lord and Lady===
[[Image:Angus McBride - Galadriel.gif|thumb|left|220px|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Galadriel'']]After Amroth and Nimrodel had passed away, Celeborn and Galadriel took the title of [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]], the common Sindarin name for Lórinand.<ref name=Concerning/> With Nenya, the land was kept pure and alive, and evil was not permitted to penetrate it. They moved back to the western side of Anduin, and built [[Caras Galadhon]], the great center of the woodland kingdom. There Galadriel planted the seeds of the [[mallorn]] trees that was given to her by Gil-galad when she lived in [[Lindon]], where they couldn't grow.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> It was because of the mellyrn that Lothlórien became known as the ''Golden Wood'' thenceforth.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}, note 5</ref> Lothlórien was filled with light and life, and became beautiful and by the power of the Elven Ring the trees did not die.

Under the Lord and Lady, Lothlórien prospered for more than a thousand years as time passed without decay under the golden boughs. Celeborn and Galadriel produced a daughter, [[Celebrían]] who married [[Elrond]], and their granddaughter [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]] was considered the fairest of the elven race at that time.

In {{TA|3017}}, [[Aragorn]] passed by Lothlórien with the captured [[Gollum]] to deliver him to [[Mirkwood]]. [[Gandalf]] got word from Lothlórien on his way to the [[Shire]], and he changed his course to go and meet them.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
But as the [[Third Age]] began to grope for its culmination, troubles at last began to touch the Valley of Singing Gold. As the shadow of [[Sauron]] lengthened, and the [[War of the Ring]] raged, Lórien received the remnant of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], a group of travellers on a quest of immeasurable importance. The border-wardens came across them. Among the company were [[Aragorn]], a prince of the [[Dúnedain]] and a friend of the Lady, as well as [[Legolas]] of [[Mirkwood]]. The only reservation the border-wardens had about them was the dwarf, [[Gimli]].<ref name=loth>{{FR|II6}}</ref> The Fellowship were led in blindfolded for a time, but at Galadriel's word they were taken to Caras Galadhon on [[17 January]], {{TA|3019}}, and their blindfolds were released.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> The very night the Fellowship arrived, a band of [[Orcs]] crossed the [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]]. A regiment or so of the [[Galadhrim]] were sent out, and destroyed the Orcs.<ref name=loth/>

There the Elves learned of the death of [[Gandalf]], and Galadriel knew what evil had been brought into the Golden Wood. She revealed her own ring to Frodo, and showed him her [[Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]].<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> Then the Fellowship was furnished with new supplies, and sent off down Anduin, bearing the gifts of the Lord and Lady.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

Right when the Company left, [[Gwaihir]] brought [[Gandalf]] to the Golden Wood, who was only recovering from his battle with [[Durin's Bane]]. He was healed, clothed and given a new [[staff]], before leaving for [[Fangorn]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>

But the coming of [[The One Ring]] was only the beginning of their troubles. But they were only the heralds of greater conflicts that were to occur. [[Sauron]] unleashed massive attacks on the Golden Wood.

On [[11 March]], Orcs from [[Dol Guldur]] swarmed into the forest in a full-scale assault. By the power of the Wood-elves and Galadriel’s ring, they were repulsed. The second wave came on [[15 March]], at the same time as the invasion of Mirkwood. Again, the Orcs were forced out. The third and last attack was made seven days later, [[22 March]]. They caused much destruction, but Celeborn led the Nandor in a great counter-attack that routed them utterly. Boats were made, and the armies of Lórien crossed the Anduin. They stormed [[Dol Guldur]] (the [[Nazgûl]] being absent in the war to the south), and took it. Galadriel threw down its walls, and Mirkwood was cleansed. The southern part of Mirkwood fell into the dominion of Lothlórien, and it was called [[East Lórien]].<ref name=Great/>

===Afterward===
[[File:War in Middle Earth - Lothlórien.png|thumb|right|Lothlórien in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'']]
Only two-and-a-half years after the War of the Ring, Galadriel, the Lady of Lórien, took ship West to Valinor. Celeborn left to [[Rivendell]] several years later, and light departed from Lórien.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

The Eastern border of Lothlórien in the southern [[Eryn Lasgalen]] became the [[East Lórien]]. The Nandor of that land either merged into the Kingdom of [[Thranduil]], or stayed in Lórien to fade and eventually pass away westward.

In the [[Fourth Age 121]], a grief-filled Arwen Undómiel travelled to Lothlórien after Aragorn surrendered his life, surrendering her own life upon [[Cerin Amroth]]. "[T]here is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten..."<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lothlórien stood between the south-eastern end of the Misty Mountains and the great river Anduin. The river Celebrant ran through the wood from its source in the mountains to the west through to the Anduin to the east.

In its earlier days, the woods of Lothlórien extended south into Fangorn Forest. In these days there was no true border between the two territories, though after conversation between [[Treebeard]] and the King of the Golden Wood it was agreed that the inhabitants of either land could walk freely at their leisure across whatever borders there may be.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> It is also possible that the woods of Lórien extended into the southern regions of Greenwood the Great, though there is only a small amount of evidence supporting this possibility.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> By the Third Age, Lórien was separate from Fangorn in the south and Mirkwood in the east by many miles.

==Locations==

*[[Cerin Amroth]]

==Etymology==
''Lothlórien'', said to mean "Lórien of the Blossom", is a compound of [[Sindarin]] ''[[loth]]'' + [[Quenya]] ''Lórien'' "?Dream Land"). Treebeard translates the name as "Dreamflower".<ref name=HMRC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 300 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref>

==Names==
Lothlórien was often shortened to '''Lórien''', or the '''Golden Wood''' (referring to the golden [[mallorn]] trees that grew in that land).<ref name=HMRC/><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 48</ref> Other names recorded for the region were:

* '''''Laurelindórenan''''' [[Quenya|Q.]] ("Valley of Singing Gold")
* ''[[Lórinand]]'' ?[[Nandorin|N.]] ("valley of gold")<ref name=UTG>{{UT|Galadriel}}, note 5</ref>
* '''''Laurenandë''''' Q. "Valley of gold"<ref name=UTG/>
* '''''Glornan''''' [[Sindarin|S.]] "Valley of gold"<ref name=UTG/>
* '''''Nan Laur''''' S. "Valley of gold"<ref name=UTG/>
* '''''Lindórinand''''' ?[[Nandorin|N.]] "Vale of the Land of the Singers"<ref name=UTG/>
* '''''Dwimordene'''''. The name means "haunted valley" in [[Old English]].<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Dwimordene"</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Lórien is one of the several battlegrounds in this game. The trees are just normal trees.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Lórien was portrayed more as a city of moonshine and soft candlelight, in stark contrast to its brilliant golden appearance (filled with sunshine) in the books.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:After defeating the Balrog, the Fellowship enters Lothlórien. There are no missions; stepping towards a ladder triggers the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]-scene and continues the game.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:In the Good Campaign, Lothlórien (along with the Fellowship) is attacked by several waves of [[orcs]] and [[trolls]]. The area is full of treasures, which form the only income needed to make elven archers.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Lothlorien map.jpg|thumb|Map of Lothlórien from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]
'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Similar to ''The Battle for Middle-earth'', a skirmish takes place after Fellowship's arrival in Lothlórien. Player's goal during the mission is to protect two mallorn trees from attacks for a certain period of time.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Lothlórien makes appearance as a Battleground in both "Evil" campaign and skirmish model. The layout of the map drastically differs from the ones in the game-predecessor.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Lothlórien is one of major regions of the game, added following the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'' expansion. It is inhabited by over a hundred of non-playable characters, who are involved in hundreds of various quests. The map shows the major landmarks of the area: The [[Mirrormere]], rivers [[Anduin]], [[Nimrodel]] and [[Celebrant]], [[Cerin Amroth]] and [[Caras Galadhon]].
