==Etymology==
''Boron'' is a word in [[Old Noldorin]] and [[Ilkorin]] for "Steadfast, trusty man, faithful vassal".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root BOR-</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', created in the 1930s,<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p, 3</ref> Bëor was followed by his sons [[Bregolas]] and [[Barahir]].  After publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' a new genealogy for the House of Bëor was made in the 1950s and at that time four generations (Baran, '''Boron''', Boromir, and Bregor) were inserted after Bëor, with Bregor the father of Bregolas and Barahir.<ref name="WJBeor"/>
