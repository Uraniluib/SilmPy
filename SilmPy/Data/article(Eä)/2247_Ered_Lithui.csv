The '''Ered Lithui''', or the '''Ash Mountains''', was a mountain range on the northern border of [[Mordor]] which separated it from [[Rhovanion]]. It ran about 500 miles from east to west. One south-western ridge divided the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] from [[Lithlad]]. A shorter southern spur within Gorgoroth ended at [[Barad-dûr]]. The west end of the Ash Mountains met the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]]. Between the Mountains of Shadow and the Ash Mountains was [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

The Ered Lithui was rugged and forbidding, described as being composed of "broken peaks and barren ridges". Its rocks were coloured grey as ash.<ref name="Gate">{{TT|IV3}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|1944}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] was leading an army to [[Dagorlad]] to challenge the [[Wainriders]]. It was expected that the enemy would assault them from the north or northeast, but the Wainriders came directly from the east, using the cover of the Ered Lithui to conceal their approach.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref> The Wainriders were greatly speeded by a long-neglected road that ran from the [[Morannon]] fifty miles to the east.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}},note 15</ref>

On [[5 March]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] looked upon the Ered Lithui before turning aside to journey to [[Ithilien]].<ref name="Gate"/> From [[19 March]] through [[22 March]]<ref name="Great"/> Frodo and Sam crawled slowly east on the road from [[Cirith Gorgor]] to Barad-dûr that hugged the slopes of the Ered Lithui.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

==Name and etymology==
''Ered Lithui'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Mountains of Ash", consisting of the words ''[[ered]]'' and ''lithui''. The name "Mountains of Ash", or "Ashy Mountains", were likely taken from their ash-grey hue.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 765</ref>
