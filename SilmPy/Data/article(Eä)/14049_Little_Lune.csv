The '''Little Lune''' was the Western tributary to the river [[Lh√ªn|Lune]]. It originated from the [[Ered Luin]] probably after the [[War of Wrath]].

The Little Lune was the Northern border of the [[Lindon]] and North of it was Dwarf country.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 313</ref> One named Dwarf realm that lay beyond was that of [[Thorin's Halls|Durin's Kingdom in Exile]] in the late [[Third Age]].

It was just a few miles south of the Little Lune that the ancient Dwarf city of [[Belegost]] was located.
