'''South Lane''' was a short lane in the [[Westfarthing]] of [[the Shire]] that led from the [[Bywater Road]] southward a quarter of a mile to the farmlands of the [[Cotton Family]].<ref name="Scouring">{{SD|Shire}}</ref> On [[2 November]] {{TA|3019}} when the [[Travellers]] were on the Bywater Road<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and had dispersed the first small knot of [[Ruffians]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] suggested that they set up a defence at the Cotton's home down South Lane. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] rejected this idea because the Ruffians could too easily hem them in and then smoke them out. Eventually the [[Hobbits]] decided on more direct action.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the manuscript for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Sam's suggestion to take the South Lane to the Cotton's farm was accepted. The Travellers went to the farm and the wary Cottons let them in. A fight broke out and six ruffians were killed. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] rewrote this episode so that no ruffians were killed at the farm, instead the hobbits were trapped and planned to burst out. At this point [[Christopher Tolkien]] said his father realized that he had taken a wrong turning; there was no credible way for the hobbits to burst out unscathed.<ref name="Scouring"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
