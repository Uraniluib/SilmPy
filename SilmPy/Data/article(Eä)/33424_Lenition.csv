'''Lenition''' is a phonological and grammatical aspect of [[Sindarin]] which reflects the phonological mutations of the language in its evolution from [[Old Sindarin]].
==Historical background==
Lenition refers to the mutation of medial consonants, occurring usually between two vowels (VCV). It affected the Old Sindarin sounds '''p, t, k, b, d, g, m''' and '''s'''. 

The sounds '''w, kh''' were lenited only at the beginning of a word.

More specifically, the evolution of these sounds can be visualized in these examples:
;p > b: OS *''kele'''p'''e'' > S ''[[celeb]]'' "silver"
;t > d: OS *''a'''t'''ar'' > S ''[[adar]]'' "father"
;k > g: OS ''[[beleka|bele'''k'''a]]'' > S ''[[beleg]]'' "great"

;b > v: OS *''ja'''b'''asse'' > S ''[[Iavas]]'' "autumn"<ref group="note" name="Q">Similar softening occurred in [[Quenya]] also.</ref>
;d > dh: OS *''ba'''d'''ro'' > S ''[[badhor]]'' "brother"
;g > ∅: OS *''khu'''g'''o'' > *''huȝo''<ref group="note">The intermediate stage of ''g'' to extinction was [[yogh]]</ref> > S ''[[hû]]'' "dog"<ref group="note" name="Q"/>

;m > v: OS *''ra'''m'''ia-'' > S ''[[revia-]]'' "to wander"
;s > ∅: OS *''thele'''s'''e'' > *''thelehe'' > S ''[[thele]]'' "sister"

;w- > gw-: OS ''[[wende|'''w'''ende]]'' > S ''[[gwend]]'' "maiden"
;kh- > h-: OS *'''''kh'''anda'' > S ''[[hand]]'' "intelligence"

==In compounds==
As a consequence, this process took place also in Old Sindarin compounds, when the initial letter of a word was no longer initial in a compound. Even in later compounds that would be pure Sindarin, the lenition was solidified as a rule, envisioning retroactively the lenition process from a theoretical Old Sindarin compound.

For example the word ''[[athrabeth]]'' "debate, converse (lit. 'across-word')" can be analyzed both as a derivative of OS word *''athra'''p'''ettha'' but also as a compound of Sindarin words ''[[athra-]]'' "across" + [[peth]]'' "word".

The fact that the above sounds mutated when medially was solidified as a rule
*[[thind]] + [[coll|'''c'''oll]] > [[Thingol]] (< ?OS *''Thinda'''k'''ollo'')
*[[cair]] + [[tân|'''t'''ân]] > [[Cirdan]] (< ?OS *''Kiria'''t'''âno'')
*[[fanui]] + [[dol|'''d'''ol]] > [[Fanuidhol]] (< ?OS *''Fanoi'''d'''olo'')
*[[Edhel]] + [[sarn|'''s'''arn]] > [[Edhelharn]] (< ?OS *''Edelo'''s'''arno'')
*[[harad|har-]] + [[Gondor|'''G'''ondor]] > [[Harondor]] (< ?OS *''Khara'''g'''onddor'')
*[[ar|ar-]] + [[gwend|'''g'''wend]] > [[Arwen]] (< ?OS *''Arwende''; no ''g'' would evolve between ''ar-'' and ''wende'')
*[[or-]] + [[hall|'''h'''all]] > [[orchal]] (< ?OS *''orkhalna''; ''kh'' would not lenite as ''h'' inside a word)

==Inspiration==
Sindarin, being inspired from the Welsh language, also borrowed heavily from its [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_morphology#Initial_consonant_mutation mutation system]<Ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.) ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'' "Sindarin grammar"</ref>. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition#Grammatical_lenition grammatical lenition] is generally prominent in the [[Celtic]] languages.
