{{disambig-more|Hope|[[Hope (disambiguation)]]}}
In addition to its [[estel|common meaning]], the Elvish word '''estel''' (the same in both [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]) refers to a complex philosophical concept found in [[Elves|Elvish]] thought. This idea is best understood as ''trust'' or "''faith''", and the hope that comes from it: ''estel'' refers to the belief that [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]], the Creator of the Universe ([[Eä]]), is good and that his designs for his creatures will ultimately be good as well, despite the troubles that seem to plague [[Arda]], this world. Certain knowledge of what is to happen to the Elves after the end of Arda has thus been withheld from them, so that all they can rely on is ''estel''. The Elven-king [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] explained ''estel'' as an idea that "is not defeated by the ways of the world, for it does not come from experience, but from our nature and first being. If we are indeed the ''[[Eruhíni|Eruchin]]'', the Children of the One, then He will not suffer Himself to be deprived of His own, not by any Enemy, not even by ourselves." 

''Estel'' is also connected to the more immediate hope found in the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] that keeps them from being overcome by the hardships of [[Arda#Arda Marred|Arda Marred]]; the [[Valar]] refer to this gift as the ability to  appreciate "the Unmarred that they discern in the Marred". That is, the Children of Ilúvatar can see what is good about Arda in its present state, despite its corruption by [[Morgoth]]. It is ''estel'' that gives them this ability.

''Estel'' is similar to, but more deeply based in the heart than, ''[[Amdir (Sindarin word)|amdir]]'', another Sindarin word that can be translated as "hope".<ref>{{MR|P4c}}</ref>

== ''Estel'' in Arda's History ==
According to Elvish tradition, ''estel'' was one of only two things Eru demanded from his Children; the other was belief that he existed in the first place. Lack of ''estel'' was seen as a fault in the ''[[fëa]]'' of a person, and could have grave consequences: the most drastic example of a being lacking in ''estel'' is none other than that of Morgoth himself; his denial of the greatness of Eru led to his nihilism and despair. The failing of ''estel'' found in [[Finwë]], the first [[High King of the Noldor]], of his wife [[Míriel]] ever returning to him from the Halls of [[Mandos]] is another example. Finwë's decision to take another wife led to the strife between his sons that was instrumental to the tragic [[Fall of the Noldor]]. Ultimately, most poor choices of Elves and [[Men]] come from a failing in ''estel''.

== ''Estel'' and Men ==
Unlike the Elves, the foundation of ''estel'' in Men was said to have been shaken because of [[Tale of Adanel|their corruption by Morgoth]] in the earliest days of their race. Because they had denied the supremacy of Eru and taken Melkor as their God, they could no longer believe with certainty that Eru would accept them. This lack of ''estel'' in Men had an effect on their view of their mortality, which was originally their [[Gift of Men|Gift]] from Eru.
