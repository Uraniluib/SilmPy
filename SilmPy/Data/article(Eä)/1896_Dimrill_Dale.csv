'''Dimrill Dale''' ('''''[[Nanduhirion]]''''' in [[Sindarin]] and '''''[[Azanulbizar]]''''' in [[Khuzdul]]) was a valley on the east side of the [[Misty Mountains]], beneath the [[Caradhras|Redhorn]], [[Celebdil|Silvertine]], and [[Fanuidhol|Cloudyhead]] peaks. It was the eastern end of [[Redhorn Pass]] and was bordered by the '''[[Dimrill Stair]]'''. Dimrill Dale was the source of the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]] river. At its southeast corner was [[Mirrormere]], a sacred lake to the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

During the [[Years of the Trees]], [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] wandered south to Dimrill Dale and founded the Kingdom of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] beneath the surrounding mountains. Thousands of years later, after Orcs had turned the Dwarven city into the "Black Pit" of [[Moria]], the climactic battle of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] was fought here. The '''[[Battle of Azanulbizar]]''', which occurred in {{TA|2799}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> ended as a defeat of the Orcs and their leader [[Azog]]. The Dwarves, though, were unable to take back Moria because of the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] that still dwelt there.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] briefly rested in Dimrill Dale after escaping from Moria, following the loss of [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Dimrill'' means "overshadowed rills" referring to the rills that ran down the mountain-side.<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>
