'''Skin-changers''' were creatures who could take different forms at will. Little is known of their abilities; the only famous skin-changers were [[Beorn]] and his [[Beornings|descendants]] (who could take the shape of a [[Men|Man]] or of a bear),<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> but evidently other skin-changers also existed.

It has been suggested that [[Radagast]], a "master of shapes and hues", was able to change his form.<Ref>[http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?t=38698 Radagast: master of shapes and hues] Forum discussion</ref>
