The '''Last Desert''' was a desert in the "East of East" inhabited by [[Were-worms]].<ref name=Hobbit>{{H|1}}</ref>

==Existence==
The Last Desert is mentioned only in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. When [[Bilbo Baggins]] insisted to [[Thorin and Company]] that he was fit to be the burglar on their quest, he said he was willing to travel to the "East of East" which, according to him, was home to a region known as the "Last Desert" where the [[Were-worms]] lived.<ref name=Hobbit /> However, this is the only mention of the Last Desert and the Were-worms, and [[Hobbits]] (who rarely left [[the Shire]]) had an extensive folklore, so the existence of the Last Desert is debated;{{who}} the Last Desert may have been a real location in the East that Bilbo was aware of, or it may have been a creation of Hobbitish legend.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/l/lastdesert.html|articlename=Last Desert|dated=|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=4 March 2018}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bilbo offered to walk from the [[The Shire|Shire]] "to ''[cancelled: [[Wikipedia:Hindu Kush|Hindu Kush]]]'' the [[Wikipedia:Gobi Desert|Great Desert of Gobi]] and fight the Wild Wire worm(s) of the [[Wikipedia:China|Chinese]]."<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 9</ref> In a slightly later version [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] altered this to say "to the last desert in the East and fight the Wild Wireworms of the Chinese",<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 40</ref> and in the final version it was altered once more to say "to the East of East and fight the wild [[Were-worms]] in the Last Desert."<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>.

Although the Last Desert is mentioned only in ''The Hobbit'', there is another mention of the greater region where it was located. In the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', an early version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the first [[Men]] were said to have awoke in the land of Eruman, which lay in the "East of East."<ref>{{SM|Q5}}</ref>
