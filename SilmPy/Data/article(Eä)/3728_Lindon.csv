'''Lindon''' was a region of the [[Westlands]]. Initially populated by [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]], in the following Ages it became an important Elvish realm, known for its harbors and Elven [[Ships]] that would sail for the [[Aman|West]].

==Geography==
Lindon was a name of [[Ossiriand]], a region west of the [[Blue Mountains]], in Eastern [[Beleriand]]. After the deluge of Beleriand in the [[War of Wrath]], Lindon became the westernmost land of the continent of [[Middle-earth]]. The [[Gulf of Lune]] broke into Lindon and the Blue Mountains and divided the realm into ''[[Forlindon]]'' (North Lindon) and ''[[Harlindon]]'' (South Lindon). The eastern border of Lindon was the [[Lune]], beyond which was [[Arnor]].<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==History==
===The First Age===
{{main|Ossiriand}}
The name Lindon was first used by the exiled Noldor for the region of [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

Lindon was the only part of Beleriand that survived the [[War of Wrath]], the rest of the land having been broken or submerged by the tumults.<ref name=PMII78>{{PM|II}}, p. 78</ref> However, [[Belegaer]] the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain, creating the [[Gulf of Lhûn]].

Many of the surviving [[Elves]] of drowned Beleriand, especially the exiled Noldor, relocated to Lindon by the beginning of the [[Second Age]], where they were ruled by [[Gil-galad]].<ref name=PMII78/>
===The Second Age: Kingdom of Gil-galad===
[[File:Liz Danforth - Elves of Lindon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Liz Danforth]] - ''Elves of Lindon'']]
[[Gil-galad]] founded the '''''Kingdom of Lindon''''' in {{SA|1}} ruling over the Noldor and Sindar and all the [[Elves of Lindon]] alike. They also built the Havens ([[Mithlond]], and also likely [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]] and [[Forlond]])<ref name=app>{{App|SA}}</ref> and many Elves left from there to [[Valinor]]. 

The [[Noldor]] mainly dwelt in Forlindon, and the Sindar (and surviving Green-elves{{fact}}) in Harlindon (a fief under the rule of [[Celeborn]]).<ref>{{PM|X}}, p. 328 (Note 65)</ref><ref>{{UT|6}}, (Introduction & Note 2)</ref> Presumably the surviving [[Edain]] also stayed for some time alongside the [[Elves of Lindon]], until they left for [[Elenna]] ({{SA|32}}). But there was some tension between the Elves; some of the Sindar did not wish to live under Gil-galad alongside the Noldor, and went to the [[Silvan Elves]] in the east, who were their [[Teleri]]n kin.<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref> Some Noldor also left to found [[Eregion]] ({{SA|700}}), the second of the two Noldorin realms. 

In {{SA|600}} [[Entulessë]], a ship from [[Númenor]] arrived in Mithlond where Gil-galad welcomed the [[Númenóreans]], before reestablishing contact with their [[Mannish]] kin, the [[Middle Men]].<ref>{{App|B1}}, entry "600"</ref><ref>{{UT|Island}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], [[Sauron]] had overrun [[Eriador]]. The Elves called that time [[Dark Years|Days of Flight]] as many fled to Lindon where Sauron could not enter, and thence over the [[Sea]] to the [[Uttermost West]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> Eventually [[Tar-Minastir]] sent ships to Lindon, responding to Gil-galad's plea. The combined army of Elves and Númenóreans drove Sauron's forces out of Eriador.<ref name=app/> The War and the establishment of [[Imladris]] diminished the realm of Lindon and didn't extend beyond the Blue Mountains any more.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #75</ref>

In the tumult following the [[Downfall of Númenor]], Lindon suffered great loss as "''the sea rode in upon the land''", and therefore had shrunk when the Third Age began.<ref>{{PM|VI}}, p. 183</ref>

===The Third Age: Rule of Círdan===

After the War of the Last Alliance, most of the Ñoldor finally departed for [[Valinor]], and Lindon became depopulated, now ruled by Gil-galad's lieutenant, the [[Sindar]]in elf [[Círdan]] the Shipwright, who kept building ships for the departing Elves.

During the days of Kings, most of the [[High Elves]] that still lingered in [[Middle-earth]] were found in Lindon. Some Dwarves had dwelt in the eastern side of the Ered Luin, such as at [[Thorin's Halls]], especially the part south of the Gulf.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> Men did not go to Lindon.<ref name=eriador/> 

Aside from Elves, [[Gandalf]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] also went to Valinor from the Grey Havens, and a family tradition held that [[Samwise Gamgee]], having been himself a [[Ring-bearer]], albeit briefly, did likewise, in the year {{FoA|61}}. Círdan stayed in Mithlond into the Fourth Age until as he said, "the last ship sails" and the remaining [[Eldar]] passed into the [[Aman|West]]. It is unclear just what the fate of the Elves of Middle-earth was in the early Fourth Age or how long Círdan and his remaining folk dwelt at the Havens and continued to build the great ships that carried the Elves to the [[Undying Lands]].

In the [[Fourth Age]], few Elves remained, if any at all.<ref name=eriador/>

==Names and Etymology==

In a post-[[Lord of the Rings|LotR]] writing, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] says that the name ''Lindon'' was coined by the Green-elves, derived from [[Nandorin]](?) *''Lindānā''. The Sindar called the country ''Dor Lindon'' and the Noldor ''Lindóne'' (or ''Lindónë''<ref>{{HM|IX}}</ref>) but both also adopted the name ''Lindon''.<ref name=WJC>{{WJ|C}}, p. 385</ref>

The name Lindon contains the element ''lin-'' "sing, song" as also seen in [[Lindar]].<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> ''Lindon'' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈlindon]}}) means "land of music",<ref>{{S|14}}</ref> 

The translation "Land of the singers", conceived to be a name in the [[Nandorin|Ossiriandic]] tongue, has been suggested by [[David Salo]], [[Arden R. Smith|Arden Smith]], [[Patrick H. Wynne|Patrick Wynne]], et al. in their linguistic contribution to ''[[Arnor: The Land]]''

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In early versions of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Appendices]]'', Gil-galad is said to have founded Lindon in {{SA}} 10.<ref>{{PM|VI}}, pp. 168, 173</ref>

''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:A [[Lindon (MERP)|supplement on Lindon]] was never released by [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]], although there were such plans,<ref>{{ICE|8014}}, p. 15</ref> and Jeff J. Erwin and Oliver Schick were commissioned to write supplements on Lindon and Mithlond, respectively (both supplements were nearly finished at the time ICE lost their license from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]]).<ref>Oliver Schick, Mailing list message of 9 Oct 2007, at [http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/fan-modules/?v=1&t=directory&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=dir&slk=3 Yahoo groups Fan modules]</ref> However, scattered information on Lindon and its prominent individuals can be found in several supplements.<ref>{{ICE|8014}}, pp. 3-4, 10-11, 14-15</ref><ref>{{ICE|4002}}, pp. 16, 44-46</ref><ref>{{ICE|2022}}, pp. 61, 148</ref><ref>{{ICE|2023}}, pp. 68-69</ref>
