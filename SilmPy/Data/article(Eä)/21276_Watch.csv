The '''Watch''' was a body of [[Hobbits]] responsible for maintaining the peace in [[the Shire]]. Its members wore caps with feathers to distinguish themselves.

It consisted of the [[Shirriffs]], a police force of twelve hobbits (three in each [[Farthings|Farthing]]) responsible for 'Internal Work', and the [[Bounders]], a larger body that guarded the borders of the Shire. The head of the Watch was the [[First Shirriff]], a post attached to that of the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]].<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>

During [[Saruman]]'s occupation, the body was greatly increased by him and the [[Chief Shirriff]].  This expanded force was organized into companies, one of which was the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>
