==In Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' it is stated that "''[[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] therefore went eastwards, about the year 700 of the Second Age, and established the (primarily but by no means solely) [[Noldor]]in realm of Eregion.''"<ref name="Galadriel"/> This contradicts the information published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' which gives the founding of [[Eregion]] in the year 750.<ref name="AppB1"/> It is possible to reconcile the texts if 700 is seen as the year of their moving eastwards with 750 as the year of the foundation of Eregion; the canonicity of this, however, is unknown.
