'''Haeren''' was a location in the western part of [[Gondor]], just below the [[White Mountains]].

The location is not mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and its nature is unknown. The name of the location only appears as a handwritten addition by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] on the final version of the ''[[General Map of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>{{HM|AoL}}, p. 203</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name is unknown, but the beginning ''hae-'' may contain the [[Sindarin]] adjective ''[[hae]]'' "very far away" (compare ''[[Haerast]]'' "Far Shore").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 25</ref>
