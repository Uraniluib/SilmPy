The '''huts of the raft-elves''' referred to a village used by the [[raft-elves]], that was to be found on a protruding bank of the [[Forest River]], close to the eastern edge of the forest of [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=H9>{{H|9}}</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (I).jpg|Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (I)]]", [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (II).jpg|Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves (II)]]</ref><ref>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 128-31</ref> It is stated that the subjects of [[Thranduil]] "had houses or huts on the ground and in the branches",<ref>{{H|8}}</ref> so it is possible that these huts were situated within the [[Woodland Realm]].

The raft-elves collected empty barrels from the [[Elvenking's Halls]] in this village, brought by the current of the Forest River. The barrels were then tied together and left to float to [[Lake-town]] (from where barrels filled with goods had originally been brought up the river to the Woodland Realm).<ref name=H9/>

[[Bilbo Baggins]], hanging on to a barrel, spent a night hiding outside the village of the raft-elves while pursuing [[Thorin and Company]] (who were escaping the imprisonment of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] inside empty barrels).<ref name=H9/>
