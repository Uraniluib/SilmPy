The '''Eglath''' ("The Forsaken") were the [[Teleri]] [[Elves]] ([[Eldar]]) of the [[Great March]] who decided to stay in [[Beleriand]] seeking their lost leader [[ElwÃ«]] ([[Thingol]]). The main host of the Teleri followed [[Olwe]] on their way to [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

The Eglath eventually became the [[Sindar]] with Thingol as their King.
==Etymology==
The name comes from [[Sindarin]] verb ''[[egla]]'' plus the plural ending ''[[-ath]]''.
