}}'''Voronwë Aranwion''' was a mariner of [[Gondolin]].

== History ==
Voronwë was related to  the [[House of Fingolfin]] through his father, [[Aranwë]], a nobleman of Gondolin and to [[Círdan]] himself through his mother, who was one of the [[Sindar]] Elves of [[Falas]].

He was sent by King [[Turgon]] to seek a passage to [[Aman]] and call on the [[Valar]] for aid against [[Morgoth]]. He delayed on the road, tarrying in [[Nan-tathren]] and because of this he was the final one to embark on the last ship that [[Círdan|Círdan The Shipwright]], at the request of Turgon, had built for them. After sailing for seven years without reaching the lands in the West, his ship attempted to return to Middle-Earth defeated.  In a storm within sight of the coast the ship was wrecked and all save him were drowned.  By the grace of Ulmo, Voronwë was saved from the wreck and washed ashore in [[Nevrast]], near [[Vinyamar]]. He was sitting at its wall when he encountered [[Tuor]] and heard his story as the messenger of Ulmo and led him back to Gondolin.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]] he was ordered by Tuor to guard [[Idril]]. He escaped the sack, and some accounts say that he sailed with [[Eärendil]] on his voyages.<ref name="UT">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' the [[Noldorin]] form of his name is given as '''[[Bronweg]]'''. As in later works he is the guide of Tuor, but also the father of [[Littleheart]] &ndash; a figure that does not recur elsewhere.<ref name="LT2Gondolin">{{LT2|III}}</ref>
