The '''Squint-eyed Southerner''' was an outlaw driven from [[Dunland]] whose name was not known. He served as an agent of [[Saruman]]; one of Saruman's most trusted, in fact. It was rumored there was Orc-blood within him (and therefore perhaps being one of the [[Half-orcs]]).<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

==History==
The Southerner at one point was stationed on the borders of [[the Shire]] to negotiate the purchase of "[[pipe-weed|leaf]]" and other supplies which Saruman was storing in preparation for the war. Saruman had ordered the man to infiltrate the Shire and learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding out who possessed [[the One Ring]]. The Southerner was well supplied with maps, lists of names, and notes concerning the Shire.

In September of {{TA|3018}}, the Dunlending was traveling back to the Shire when the [[Nazg청l|Black Riders]] came upon him at the [[Tharbad]] crossing. When questioned, the Southerner told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying Saruman, which made the Witch-king realize Saruman was not a true ally. The Witch-king was made aware of the name [[Baggins Family|Baggins]] and [[Hobbiton]] was singled out for immediate visit and inquiry.

The Witch-king put the [[Shadow]] of Fear on the Dunlending and sent him to [[Bree]] to listen for information of Baggins. The Southerner met up with [[Bill Ferny]] and at [[the Prancing Pony]] on [[September 29]]th, the two of them saw [[Frodo Baggins]] vanish into thin air. After reporting the information to the [[Nazg청l]], the Ringwraiths came to attack that night.<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

Aragorn kept the hobbits safe through the night and the next morning the Squint-eyed Southerner was spotted inside Bill Ferny's house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name="FRI11">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

Nothing else is recorded of the Squint-eyed Southerner, however in {{TA|3019|n}}, many of Saruman's agents occupied the Shire and oppressed the Hobbits.<ref>{{HM|RK}}, "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref> It is possible the Southerner was among them as many of the Men resembled him. The Men were driven out of the Shire in the [[Battle of Bywater]] on November 3rd.

==Description==
{{quote|Just what my father meant to convey by the 'squint-eyed Southerner' at Bree I'm not sure. I don't think that he can possibly have meant that the man had 'slit-eyes' (goblin-like). He may have meant that he actually had a squint (optical disorder), but that seems unnecessarily particular. So the likeliest meaning, I think, is that the man didn't look straight, but obliquely, watchfully, sideways, suggesting craftiness and crookedness.|[[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>"The Squint-eyed Southerner", ''[[Beyond Bree]]'', May [[1990]], p. 9</ref>}}

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A Decipher card identifies one of the Men at [[Bree]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as the Squint-eyed Southerner.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''
:A character credited as "Squint" appears in the prologue in Bree. Along with another character credited as "Bill Ferny Sr." (loosely based on Bill Ferny), Squint has seemingly tracked [[Thorin]] to the Prancing Pony (presumably to collect on the bounty put out on Thorin's head). The two Men are preparing to confront Thorin when [[Gandalf]] goes over and sits and starts talking with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]. When it becomes apparent the [[Wizards|Wizard]] is not going anywhere, Bill and Squint get up and leave the inn.
