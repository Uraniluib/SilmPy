'''Arveleg''' ({{TA|1633}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1813|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 180) was the twelfth king of [[Arthedain]].

==History==
Arveleg came to throne upon the death of his father, [[Arvegil]], in {{TA|1743}}. He ruled for seventy years, apparently in an uneventful period as no noteworthy events are recorded during his reign.

He died 180 years old and was succeeded by his son, [[Araval]].<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
Arveleg's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Mighty King" from ''[[ar]]'' meaning "royal", and ''[[beleg]]'' (becoming [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''veleg'') meaning "mighty, strong". It is likely, however, that he was simply named after his great-great-grandfather, [[Arveleg I]].
