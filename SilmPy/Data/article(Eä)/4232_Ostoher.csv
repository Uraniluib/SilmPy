}}'''Ostoher''' ({{TA|222}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|492|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 270) was the seventh [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
In {{TA|420}}, Ostoher rebuilt and enlarged [[Minas Anor]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Upon completion, he made Minas Anor his summer residence, which became the tradition of his successors.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Later, in {{TA|490}}, [[Gondor]] was invaded for the first time by [[Easterlings]].  Since Ostoher had become an old man his son [[Tarostar]] worked to defeat this threat.  Tarostar succeeded, but not until {{TA|500}}, years after Ostoher's death.<ref name="TA"/>

==Etymology==
'''Ostoher''' means "Fortress Lord" in [[Quenya]].
