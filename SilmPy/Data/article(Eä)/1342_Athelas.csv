'''Athelas''', also known as '''Kingsfoil''' or '''''[[asëa aranion]]''''' ("Beneficial of Kings"), was a sweet-smelling herb with healing powers, such as curing wounds, poison and counteracting evil influence such as the [[Black Breath]]. 

==History==
During the [[First Age]] athelas was perhaps growing in [[Beleriand]]. [[Huan]] had found athelas to heal [[Beren]] of his wounds.<ref name="Canto10">{{LB|C10}}</ref>

Athelas most notably grew on the island of [[Númenor]] and was brought to [[Middle-earth]] by [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="Flight">{{FR|I12}}</ref> It grew sparsely in [[Eriador|the North]] and only in places where the Men of Westernesse had camped or lived, but by the end of the [[Third Age]] only the [[Rangers of the North]] retained the knowledge of its healing properties. 

In Gondor (where it was known as '''Kingsfoil''') its healing virtues were unknown and its leaves were esteemed only for their refreshing scent but it was especially powerful in the hands of the [[Kings of Gondor|king]], perhaps because of the [[Elves|Elvish]] heritage of the [[House of Anarion|royal house]].<ref name="Healing">{{RK|V8}}</ref>

It was used by [[Aragorn]] on several occasions: healing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] from the Morgul wound,<ref name="Flight"/> tend the wounds of Frodo and Sam after the exit from [[Moria]],<ref name="Lorien">{{FR|II6}}</ref> and, secretly entering [[Minas Tirith]] upon his return to [[Gondor]], to heal those touched by the [[Black Breath]], an act that enhanced his reputation and strengthened his claim to the crown.<ref name="Healing"/>

==Properties and Effects==

Athelas, when dried and crushed in hot water, is refreshing, clears, calms<ref name="Flight"/> the minds and strengthens<ref name="Lorien"/> those smelling the scent. It also has a particular scent that is particular to individual who smells the herb:

* [[Faramir]]'s scent is of "dewy mornings of unshadowed sun... [in which] Spring is itself but a fleeting memory"<ref name="Healing"/>
* [[Ioreth]] smells "roses of Imloth Melui" of her childhood<ref name="Healing"/>
* [[Éowyn]] smells no scent as if the air was clean, fresh and had never "been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam."<ref name="Healing"/>
* [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s smell is that of "orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees"<ref name="Healing"/>

==Etymology==
''Athelas'' is a [[Sindarin]] word, consisting of ''[[athae]]'' + ''[[lass]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 49</ref>

''Kingsfoil'' has the Old French element ''foil'', "leaf" as seen in [[Wikipedia:cinquefoil|cinquefoil]].<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 781</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Athelas doesn't appear in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' or in the tales of the [[First Age]] in general; however in the early ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' it was used by [[Huan]] and [[Lúthien]] to heal wounded [[Beren]].<ref name="Canto10"/> It contradicts the information from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' of it being brought to Middle-earth by [[Númenóreans]],<ref name="Flight"/> so its history was either revised by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], or athelas grew in [[Beleriand]] before it was destroyed, and then brought ''back'' to Middle-earth by Númenóreans in the [[Second Age]].
