{{main|Túrin}}
'''Gorthol''' ("The Dread Helm") or just '''The Helm''', was one of [[Túrin]]'s many aliases, taken by him as one of the [[Two Captains]] of [[Dor-Cúarthol]]<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 146</ref> in reference to the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]].<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 79</ref>
==History==
The name was used by [[Túrin]] during the time he dwelt with [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] in the caverns of [[Amon Rûdh]]. It comes from the [[Dragon-helm]] of [[Dor-lómin]], a relic from his ancestor, [[Hador]], that he wore when he hunted [[Orcs]] with [[Beleg]], and the fame of his helm, and the bow of Beleg, gave that region for a time the name [[Dor-Cúarthol]], the Land of Bow and Helm. 

Because of its fame, the mighty Helm of Hador was to be Túrin's undoing. Through it, despite his alias, [[Morgoth]] was able to learn where Túrin could be found. Through the treachery of [[Mîm]], Túrin was captured by [[Orcs]], and carried off toward [[Angband]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
