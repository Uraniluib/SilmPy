'''Zamîn''', called "mother Zamîn" by the boy [[Îbal]], was a servant in the [[White House]] of [[Erendis]].  As such she was a companion of Erendis' daughter, [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]], who first learned of her father's name ([[Aldarion]]) from the old country woman.

When Ancalimë had grown to adulthood and become the heir of the king (upon Tar-Aldarion's reformulation of the [[Law of Succession in Númenor]]) she was beset by suitors coming to [[Emerië]].  Zamîn aided the [[Tar-Ancalimë|Emerwen Aranel]], or "Princess Shepherdess" to go into hiding on a farm bordering the lands of [[Hallatan]] of [[Hyarastorni]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Zamîn's name appears to be [[Adûnaic]], but its meaning is impossible to determine.
