'''The Fall of Gil-galad''' is the lay that tells of the loss of [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], the last Great Elf-king of Middle-earth and the last High King of the Eldar, in the [[Siege of Barad-d√ªr]] at the end of the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. 

==Song==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.

</poem>

==History==
According to [[Aragorn]], it was originally written in an ancient tongue. It was [[Bilbo Baggins]] who later translated it into the [[Westron|Common Tongue]], and taught it to [[Samwise Gamgee]] in his youth. It seems to be a long poem, telling the story of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], at least to the point where [[Gil-galad]] aided in the overthrow of [[Sauron]], and was himself slain. 

Sam narrated the three introductory stanzas while approaching [[Weathertop]]. Aragorn and Frodo knew more of the text.<ref name="FKnife" />

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
: Sam sang the song during his trip to Rivendell.
