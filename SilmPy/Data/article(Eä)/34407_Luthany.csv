'''Luthany''', also known as '''[[Lúthien]]''' or '''[[Leithian]]''' is a name of a land mentioned in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In that early version of his [[legendarium]], Luthany in the later centuries became the island of Great Britain.

Before Luthany became an island, the [[Elves]] sought refuge after the wars of the [[Elder Days]]. Locations on Luthany were [[Kortirion]] and [[Tavrobel]]. But when Luthany was invaded by the [[Rumhoth]] (Romans), the Elves returned to [[Tol Eressea]]. There, they continued to speak the [[Old English|language]] of Luthany.

Its King was [[Ingwë|Inwë]] (or Ing) and he was driven east over the sea by [[Ossë]] and became ruler of some peoples. Their descendants, called Angles, Saxons, Jutes (but not Frisians) eventually returned to Luthany, now separated from the Great Lands by a channel as an island. 

When [[Eriol]] traveled from Britain to Tol Eressea, the [[Elves]] narrated to him the tales of the [[Elder Days]] and the origins of Luthany.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 301-9</ref>

==Etymology==
Luthany seems to be an Anglicized version of the Elvish name Lúthien (and Leithian); it is said to mean "friendship"<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 301</ref>, named after the friendship of Men and Elves.

==Inspiration==

The name ''Luthany'' appears to have been invented by the poet [[Francis Thompson]], whom Tolkien admired.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]''</ref> The name appears as a location in his "fantasy" poem ''The Mistress of Vision''. [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculates that the name is just randomly made-up by Thompson.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}</ref>
