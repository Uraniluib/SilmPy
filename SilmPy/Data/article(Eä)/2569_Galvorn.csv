'''Galvorn''' was a metal devised by [[Eöl]] from which he made resistant armor. Black and "shining like jet", it was hard as steel, but supple and malleable, proving resistant to all blades and darts.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

It's possible that galvorn was forgotten or lost with Eöl's death, as it was not mentioned in the later [[Ages]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 157, entry "Galvorn"</ref>
==Etymology==
The word ''galvorn'' translates as "shining black" in [[Sindarin]]. It is formed by combining ''[[gal]]'', which means "shine" and ''[[morn]]'', signifying "dark" or "black".<ref>"[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth]" at [http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 8 June 2011)</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The original name of ''galvorn'' was ''rodeöl'', the metal of Eöl. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] changed this many times, to ''glindûr'', ''targlîn'', ''morlîn'', back to ''glindûr'', and then ''maeglin''.  Finally ''galvorn'' was chosen.<ref>{{WJ|Maeglin}}, pp. 322-323</ref>
