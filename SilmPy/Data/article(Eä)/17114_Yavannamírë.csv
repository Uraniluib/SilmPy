'''Yavannamírë''' was a [[Fragrant Trees|fragrant evergreen tree]] which had globed, scarlet fruits. The [[Eldar]] of [[Tol Eressëa]] brought it among other trees as a gift from the West to the [[Númenóreans]]. In [[Númenor]] the tree thrived in [[Nísimaldar]] around the port of [[Eldalondë]], but seemingly never in the [[Middle-earth]], and was thus lost from the Mortal Lands at the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. In the songs, however, it was still remembered after the Downfall like the other trees of the Nísimaldar: [[oiolairë]], [[lairelossë]], [[nessamelda]], [[vardarianna]], and [[taniquelassë]].<ref name=UTNum>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
