'''East Beleriand''' was the part of [[Beleriand]] that lay east of the River [[Sirion]] and west of the [[Gelion]], and stretched a hundred leagues across at its widest<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 261</ref>. This region was ruled by [[Thingol]] from [[Doriath]] and (east of [[Aros]]) largely under the control of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] during the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==Geography==
Sirion descended from the north to the south. With its tributaries [[Mindeb]], [[Esgalduin]], [[Aros]] and its tributary [[Celon]], they formed [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]] and [[Forest of Region|Region]], the forests of [[Doriath]]. North of Doriath, the rivers separated the lands of [[Dimbar]], [[Nan Dungortheb]], [[Dor Dínen]] and [[Himlad]], just south from the northern highlands.

Separated from Doriath, next to the eastern banks of [[Celon]] was the small wood of [[Nan Elmoth]].

The [[Pass of Aglon]] and the [[March of Maedhros]] were two passes among a couple of small mountain ranges, which led to [[Lothlann]].

To the south was [[Estolad]] and more open, vast empty lands, until the eastern part of the ridge of [[Andram]], ending to the [[Amon Ereb]].

The eastern part of Beleriand was dominated by the river [[Gelion]], which separated the main lands from [[Thargelion]] and the land of [[Ossiriand]], marked by the river's tributaries ([[Ascar]], [[Thalos]], [[Legolin]], [[Brilthor]], [[Duilwen]] and [[Adurant]]). Further to the east, the [[Blue Mountains]] separated Beleriand from [[Eriador]].

Between the great rivers Sirion and Gelion, to the south of Beleriand was the great forest [[Taur-im-Duinath]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>
