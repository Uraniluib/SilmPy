The '''First Battle of Beleriand''' was the first battle of the Wars of [[Beleriand]], fought by the [[Sindar]] against [[Morgoth]].

While the [[Noldor]] still toiled through [[Araman]], Morgoth had already arrived in Middle-earth, and had occupied his old fortress of [[Angband]] where his servants [[Sauron]] and [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] had long been breeding [[Orcs]].

Unexpected by the Sindar, Morgoth decided to try and secure the area quickly, and he sent out his armies. This was the only battle against the Dark Lord in which the realm of King Elu Thingol took an active role. Morgoth's forces broke into two hosts, passing west through the vale of [[Sirion]] and east between [[Aros]] and [[Gelion]], some of them even scaling the passes of Anarch and [[Pass of Aglon|Aglon]].<ref>{{S|10}}</ref>

In the east, King Elu Thingol of [[Doriath]] took the offensive, meeting the Orcs at [[Amon Ereb]]. There King [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]] of the [[Laiquendi]] met him, and the Orcs were forced back-to-back. The lightly armed company of Denethor fell on Amon Ereb before Thingol could rescue him and King Denethor himself was slain, but the Orcs were eventually defeated.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref> Those few survivors were slain by the [[Dwarves]] of [[Mount Dolmed]].<ref>{{S|10}}</ref>

In the west, the [[Elves of the Falas]] under their Lord [[Círdan]] attacked the western host, but they lost that fight and retreated in their cities of [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]].<ref>{{S|10}}</ref> These cities were besieged afterwards, and Doriath was unable to gather a strong enough force to send aid. The Havens were only freed when the Orcs withdrew to fight the Noldor under [[Fëanor]].

After the First Battle, Doriath was protected by the magical ''[[Girdle of Melian]]''. 

The death of King Denethor in this battle led the Laiquendi to pledge to never again name a king or participate in the wars between other Elves and Morgoth.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref>
