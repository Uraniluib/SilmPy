In [[the Etymologies|the ''Etymologies'']] there are two homophonus roots: AR<sup>1</sup> is a root which signifies "day" and it seems to have been redefined by Tolkien (cf. [[AS]]); the  root AR<sup>2</sup> has no exact signification although its derivatives relate to "outsideness"; the general sense seems to be somewhat retained for the root AR as given in ''Eldarin Roots and Stems'').<ref name=LR348>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 348</ref>
