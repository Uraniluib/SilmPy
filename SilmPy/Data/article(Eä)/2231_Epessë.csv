'''Epessë''', [[Quenya]] for '''after-name''', is a nickname or honorific given to an elf at some point in his or her life. It is one of the '''[[essë|anessi]]''', or given names, of [[High Elves]], along with the '''[[father-name]]'''  and '''[[amilessë]]''' ("mother-name").<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''Note on Mother-names'', p. 339</ref> The epessë was a public name, and the person it was given to sometimes adopted it as one of his or her actual names.

An example is ''Gil-galad'' ("Star of Radiance"), which was the mother-name of the last [[High King of the Noldor]]. His father-name was ''Rodnor''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The Parentage of Gil-galad'', p. 350</ref> Upon becoming king he was given the epessë ''Ereinion'' ("Scion of Kings") and called [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants'', p. 347</ref>
