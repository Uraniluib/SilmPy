The '''Carrock''' was a stony eyot in the upper reaches of the River [[Anduin]], to the north of the [[Old Ford]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref>  The river looped around the rock although there was a ford of stones (probably the [[Ford of Carrock]]) to the eastern bank, while there was a swirling channel under its western cliff.  At the base was a little cave with adjacent steps that led to a flat space upon the top.<ref name="Queer">{{H|Queer}}</ref>

==History==
[[Anduin]] apparently had several such eyots, which [[Beorn]] called carrocks, but he referred to that particular one as "the Carrock" being closer to [[Beorn's Hall|his home]]. Beorn built stairs reaching to its top, and sometimes would be seen climbing to the top in the form of a [[Bears|bear]] to look at the [[Moon]] or the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Queer"/>

In {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were placed on the summit by the [[Eagles]]. They bathed and rested at the cave.

According to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] account of his journey, [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]]'s home, [[Rhosgobel]], was near the Carrock.<ref name="Queer"/>
==Etymology==
Like ''[[Chetwood#Etymology|Chetwood]]'', the name ''Carrock'' appears to be a compound of two words of the same meaning: [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:carr#Old_English|carr]]'', [[Welsh]] ''[[Wiktionary:carreg|carreg]]'' "rock, stone" + English ''rock''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] experimented with a number of names before he settled upon the ''Carrock'' â€” he first considered ''Sorneldin'', then ''Sinrock'', then ''Lamrock'' before making his final choice.<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}, note 12, p. 246</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]:''' 
:After the Eagles take Thorin and Company to the Carrock, Thorin and Bilbo reconcile after Thorin's heavy resentment against Bilbo. Contrary to the books, [[Erebor]] is clearly visible from the rock.

'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Carrock can be seen from a distance in the [[Beorning]]-exclusive area, the "[[Vales of Anduin]]", but it itself cannot be explored up close.
