The '''Halls of Mandos''' were the dwellings of [[Námo]], the Doomsman of the Valar; he was more often given the name Mandos from his own halls. 

==Description==
The Halls of Mandos stood on the northern shores of [[Valinor]],<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}; cf. [[#Other versions of the Legendarium]]</ref> looking out across the [[Ekkaia|Encircling Sea]]. They were said to grow in size as the World aged, and their walls were hung with the tapestries of Námo's spouse [[Vairë]], depicting all the events of unfolding history. 

It was to the Halls of Mandos that the spirits of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] were gathered to await their different fates, and so Mandos was given its name of the '''Halls of Awaiting'''.<ref>{{S|7}}</ref><ref group=note>In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', there is a reference to the '''halls of waiting''' in the last words of [[Thorin]]: "'Farewell, good thief,' he said. 'I go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until the world is renewed.'" (Chapter 18).</ref> After a time, the immortal Elves could be re-embodied, and return from the Halls to their kin in [[Aman]]. Men had a different fate, a fate which, even among the [[Valar|Lords of Valinor]], only Mandos and [[Manwë]] truly understood. No one, however, not even [[Morgoth]], could escape the Halls without Mandos' permission.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>

In the earliest form of the Legendarium (''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''), [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that there is a distinction between the wider region of [[Aman]], and the Halls which doesn't appear in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'';<ref name=lt3n>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref> both share the name with the Vala, who is called Ve, Vefantur Mandos ([[Qenya]]) Bannoth Gwi, Gwi-fanthor ([[Gnomish]]).<ref name=app>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

'''Mandos''' (Gnomish: '''Bannoth''') is the name of a region of vast caverns in northern Aman, full of gloom and echoes, that went down under the [[Shadowy Seas]].<ref name=lt3>{{LT1|III}}</ref> Mandos is also occupied by [[spirits]] older than the world, that were with [[Ilúvatar]].<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref><ref name=app/>

The region of Mandos contain the Halls proper, that are called after the Vala's own name, '''Ve''' (Gnomish: '''Gwi''' or '''Ingwi'''). The sable Hall has floors and columns of jet and is draped with dark vapours. It is lit only with a single vessel containing some gleaming drops from the pale dew of [[Telperion|Silpion]], placed in the centre. The [[Elves]] who die fare for days in Mandos until Vefantur spoke their doom, and they wait in the darkness, dreaming of their past deeds, until reincarnated.<ref name=lt3/> In [[Gnomish]], the Halls are also "improperly" (according to the [[Gnomish Lexicon]]) named ''Bannoth'', after the Vala and the region. The [[Qenya Lexicon]] also refers to ''Mandos'' as "the Halls of Ve and Fui" without commenting whether it's proper usage.<ref name=app/>

After the [[Hiding of Valinor]], Mandos and Fui made [[Qalvanda]], the Road of Death, which however leads directly and only to their Halls.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}</ref>

In the later ''[[The Etymologies]]'', ''Mando'' or ''Mandos(se)'' is the proper name of the Vala, being a personal noun meaning "Imprisoner".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>

Tolkien originally intended the Halls to be in northern Aman, on the edge of the [[Ekkaia|Outer Sea]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]], erroneously seeing a discrepancy, changed this to western Aman, on the edge of the Outer Sea for the published ''Silmarillion''.<ref>{{S|Valaquenta}}</ref> In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' he referred to this change as a "piece of unwarranted editorial meddling."<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref>
