'''Fankil''', also known as '''Fangli''' and '''FÃºkil''' in the earlier stages of the writing, was a servant of [[Melko]], and only appeared in the early outlines of the [[Gilfanon]]'s tale. He acted as the lieutenant of the Dark Lord,<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 237</ref> a role that would be taken by [[Sauron]] in the final version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

Fankil is first mentioned in a note regarding the [[Awakening of the Elves]] as having escaped into the world with the other dark shapes when the [[Valar]] broke [[Utumno|Utumna]].<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}, p. 107</ref> He then came in order to live among the First [[Men]], presumably in [[Palisor]]. He, along with his [[Dwarves]]<ref group=note>Dwarves were originally among the evil creatures in the ''Book of Lost Tales''</ref> and [[goblins]] mingled among Men in order to estrange them from the [[Elves]] and some joined the evil [[Dwarves]]. This resulted to the [[Battle of Palisor]], the first war between Elves and goblins. In some earlier sketch, Fangli and his evil Dwarves, conquered Palisor. The Men corrupted by him became wild and savage peoples, worshiping Melko.
