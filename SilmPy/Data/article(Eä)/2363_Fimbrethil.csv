'''Fimbrethil''' or '''Wandlimb''' was [[Treebeard]]'s long-lost [[Entwives|entwife]].<ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|III4}}</ref> 

==History==
The pair were beloved since before even [[Morgoth]] first arose in power during the youth of the world.  As with all of the other Entwives, Fimbrethil had been missing since [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]] during the Second Age.<ref name="Treebeard"/> At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Treebeard had not seen his beloved Fimbrethil for over 3,000 years. 

During the [[Last March of the Ents]] against [[Isengard]], Treebeard felt that many of the Ents were marching to their doom, and that indeed, he might never see his Fimbrethil ever again. Treebeard told [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that Saruman had to be stopped, although he would dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil once again.<ref name="Treebeard"/>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Fimbrethil'' consists of the words ''[[fim]]'' and ''[[Brethil (Sindarin word)|brethil]]''.

Different translations given by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] were: "slender-beech"<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref>, "slim-birch"<ref>{{RK|I2}}</ref>, and "slender princess"<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 23, 82</ref>.
