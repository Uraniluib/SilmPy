'''Kine of Araw''' were a species of [[cows|oxen]] that lived in fields in [[Rhûn]] near the [[Sea of Rhûn]], and they were hardier and wilder than any other oxen in [[Middle-earth]]. Legends claimed that they were descended from the cattle of the [[Oromë]], the Huntsman of the Valar, and so they were named the Kine of Araw<ref name=V1>{{RK|V1}}</ref><ref>{{App|South}}</ref> ([[Oromë#Etymology|Araw]] being the [[Sindarin]] form of [[Oromë]]'s name).

The Kine were famous as the quarry of [[Vorondil]] the Hunter, ancestor of the [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards of Gondor]]. It was he who cut a horn from one of these beasts and fashioned a hunting-horn from it, the [[Great Horn]], which came to be carried by the eldest son of the Ruling Steward from [[Vorondil]]'s time onward. The last heir to bear the horn was [[Boromir]], who saw it broken in two in his battle with [[Orcs]] beneath [[Amon Hen]].<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref><ref name=V1 />

In an unpublished manuscript held at the [[Bodleian Library]], the Wild Kine were likened by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] to ''[[wikipedia:Aurochs|aurochs]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 265</ref>
