'''Tolfalas''' also '''Tol Falas''' was a large island, that stood beyond the [[Ethir Anduin]] in the [[Bay of Belfalas]]. 

During the [[Akallabêth|Drowning of Númenor]] Tolfalas was almost destroyed, and was left like a barren and lonely mountain in the water not far from the Ethir.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref>

Its sharp southern cape was traditionally considered as marking the southernmost point of [[Gondor]] proper.{{fact}}
