[[File:Dourhands.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Gormr Doursmith]] and his guards.]]The '''Dourhands''' were a clan of [[dwarves]], invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. They were the dwarves that stayed behind to rebuild the Dwarven Halls in the [[Blue Mountains]] which were destroyed during the [[War of Wrath]]. They later aligned themselves with [[Angmar]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Some time during the [[Third Age]], the Dourhands were experiencing great poverty and hunger. Under the leadership of [[Skorgrím]] they raided the Elven refuge of Edhelion for their relics and treasures. He also had the Dourhands ally themselves with the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and [[Trolls]] to drive out the Elves. Yet, it was not enough and he was slain in battle. Leaderless, the remaining Dourhands scattered themselves throughout [[Eriador]] setting up strongholds and camps. 

Six hundred years later, shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], a Gaunt-lord from the [[First Age]] named Ivar who dwells in Garth Agarwen, an ancient fortress of [[Rhudaur]], summoned a fell spirit to possess the preserved corpse of Skorgrím. The wight convinced the Dourhand that he was a dwarf from the line of Skorgrím and managed to ally them with the forces of Angmar.
