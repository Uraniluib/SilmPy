{{Pronounce|Doriath.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Doriath''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈdorjaθ]}}) was the land of the [[Sindar]].  It was called the Fenced Land, for its queen, [[Melian]], put a girdle of enchantment about it, so that none could enter without King [[Thingol]]'s permission.
==Geography==
Doriath was a realm of forests about the great river [[Sirion]], with in it the forests ''Neldoreth'' (also ''[[Taur-na-Neldor]]'', the northern [[Beeches|beech]] forest), ''[[Nivrim]]'' (also West-march, an oak forest), and ''[[Forest of Region|Region]]''. Additionally, the forests of ''[[Brethil]]'' and ''[[Nan Elmoth]]'' were held as part of Doriath, but these last two lay outside the Girdle of Melian. King Elu [[Thingol]] of Doriath, also High King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the [[Gelion]] to [[Belegaer]].
==History==
The [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] had passed by it on the [[Great Journey]], and had been ferried across on [[Tol Eressëa]] by the time the [[Teleri]] arrived. Then their lord [[Elwë]] was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when [[Ulmo]] returned for them a part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves, and when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.

Doriath was originally named '''''[[Doriath#Etymology|Eglador]]''''',<ref name=SSindar/> but in the last years before the rising of the [[Sun]], attacks by [[Orcs]] and other [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s creatures began to increase in Beleriand, and Melian fenced the forests of Neldoreth, Region, and Nivrim. Thingol then called all the [[Sindar]] to Doriath, but many remained in the wild. After the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], many [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] removed to Doriath.

[[Eöl]] the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid the sword [[Anglachel]] for it.

The [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]] were contracted to build the halls of [[Menegroth]], which became Thingol's capital.

When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth after the rising of the Sun, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the children of [[Finarfin]], who were related to him by his brother [[Olwë]].

When later [[Men]] arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but at [[Finrod]]'s request the [[Haladin]] were allowed to live in [[Brethil]].

[[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]] and lord of the [[House of Bëor|First House of Men]], passed through the Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth. There Thingol's daughter Lúthien fell in love with him. After the Quest for the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] the Wolf [[Carcharoth]] also breached the Girdle, but Thingol, Beren, and Thingol's captains [[Beleg]] and [[Mablung]] hunted and killed the beast.

[[Túrin]] was sent to Doriath, and lived there until he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and sister, [[Morwen]] and [[Nienor]] lived there, until they were lost.

[[Húrin]] brought the treasure of [[Nargothrond]] to Doriath after the fall of Finrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of [[Nogrod]] to combine the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the [[Nauglamír]], the Dwarves' Necklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol, and slew him, stealing the necklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with her the protective Girdle.

Doriath was briefly restored under Beren and Lúthien's son [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]], but he was attacked and killed by the [[sons of Fëanor]] in the [[Second Kinslaying]]. Afterwards Doriath remained abandoned until it was sunk along with most of the rest of Beleriand.

==Etymology==

''Doriath'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "Land of the Fence"<ref name=silmindex>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=WJ/> or "Land of the [[Girdle of Melian|Girdle]]"<ref name=SSindar>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>. The name consists of the elements ''[[dôr]]'' + ''[[iâth]]''.<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 370, 378</ref>

The earlier name of Doriath, ''Eglador'', probably means either "Land of the Forsaken"<ref name=silmindex/> or "Land of the [[Elves]]"{{fact}} in [[Sindarin]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==

'''Artanor''' ("The Land Beyond") was in early versions of the [[legendarium]] the name for what was later called Doriath.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]; [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed), ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''</ref>
