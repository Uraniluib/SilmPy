'''Drúwaith Iaur''' or '''Old Púkel land''' was a region with dark forests on the west of [[Gondor]]. It was between the river [[Isen]] and the western edge of the [[Ered Nimrais]].<ref>{{UT|West}}</ref>

Drúwaith Iaur was not a part of the realm of Gondor,<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 9</ref> and therefore also not of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. It was home to the remnants of the [[Drúedain]], the original inhabitants of the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]], who were dispersed by the Númenóreans as they were hostile to them.<ref name="Druedain">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Drúwaith Iaur'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''drú'' ("wild") + ''[[waith]]'' ("folk, land") and ''[[iaur]]'' ("old"); it is thus a literal translation of ''Old Púkel land''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxiv</ref><ref name=VT42/>  On a "scrap of writing", according to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the word ''Iaur'' did not mean "original" but "former".<ref name="Druedain"/>
