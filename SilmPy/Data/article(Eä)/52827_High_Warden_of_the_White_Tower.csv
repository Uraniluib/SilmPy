'''High Warden of the White Tower''' is a [[Gondor]]ian title borne at least by [[Boromir]], son of [[Denethor II]]. Boromir's brother [[Faramir]] told to [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] in [[Ithilien]] that Boromir 'was the High Warden of the [[Tower of Ecthelion|White Tower]], and our Captain-General'.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>

It is not known what responsibilities belonged to the office of the High Warden, or was it only a honorific title. No other bearers of the title are known. It is also possible that the title means the same as [[Captain of the White Tower]], a title borne by Boromir,<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> and Faramir after him.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>
