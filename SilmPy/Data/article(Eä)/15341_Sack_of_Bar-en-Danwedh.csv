The '''Sack of Bar-en-Danwedh''' was a battle that occurred in [[Amon Rûdh]] between the forces of [[Morgoth]] and the [[Gaurwaith]] led by [[Túrin]] and [[Beleg]].

==Prelude==
Bar-en-Nibin-noeg, the House of the [[Petty-dwarves]], was the home of [[Mîm]] and sons. Mîm and his sons encountered the outlaws and was captured but bargained for his life and ransomed his home on [[Amon Rûdh]], thereby becoming Bar-en-Danwedh, the [[House of Ransom]].

Túrin and the outlaws were soon joined by the elf Beleg, and they named the land "Dor-Cúarthol" after Beleg’s bow [[Belthronding]] and the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]] worn by Túrin. Under their leadership, the Outlaws harassed the forces of Morgoth that entered their land. However by donning the Dragon-helm Túrin revealed himself to Morgoth, and he began to fear the growing power of Túrin "that the curse that he laid upon him would become void, and he would escape the doom that had been designed for him".<ref>{{CH|8}}, pp. 147</ref> However, Mîm - wanting his home to himself - sought out the Orcs and gave them the location of the outlaws' hideout 

==The Battle==
With the new knowledge of the outlaws' hideout, the Orcs attacked the hill. The watchmen stationed on the summit gave warning of the approach, but Mîm guided the Orcs to the entrance of Bar-en-Danwedh. Túrin and Beleg were being driven back inside the halls, and men were shot by arrows fleeing up the stairs. Túrin and Beleg rolled a great stone across the passage and at this moment Andróg revealed to them the hidden stair inside the halls that leads to the flat summit of Amon Rûdh. 

Túrin and the remaining men, including Andróg and Beleg, climbed up the hidden stair and surprised the few Orcs that were already there. For a while they managed to hold off the attack from the Orcs who were climbed up the rock. But the summit offered no protection from the arrows of the Orcs from below, so many were shot down including Andróg, pierced by an arrow at the head.

Eventually only Túrin, Beleg and 10 men remained and they withdrew to the summit and surrounded the standing stone. At last, all that were left were Túrin and Beleg: Túrin was captured and taken alive to [[Angband]]; Beleg was wounded and left bound and on the floor to die, however Andróg - although mortally wounded - cut Beleg free.<ref>{{CH|9}}, pp. 149-150</ref> The only other survivor was [[Andvír]], son of [[Andróg]].<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}, p. 311</ref>
