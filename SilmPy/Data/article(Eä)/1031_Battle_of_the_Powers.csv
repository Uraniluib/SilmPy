The '''Battle of the Powers''' was the great battle between the [[Valar]] and [[Morgoth|Melkor]] that took place soon after the awakening of the [[Elves]]. 

==History==
The battle was fought mainly because the Elves awakened, and needed deliverance from Melkor's interference. The forces of Valinor easily triumphed in this battle.  [[Morgoth|Melkor]] was driven from Middle Earth back to his fortress of [[Utumno]], and a guard was placed over [[Cuiviénen]] to protect the newly-awakened Firstborn from his evil influence. However, this battle marred the area upon which it was fought. Its landscape was changed forever.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>
