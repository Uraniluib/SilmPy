'''Vána''', one of the [[Valier]], was the younger sister of [[Yavanna]] and the spouse of [[Oromë]]. Among the seven Valier, Vána was the sixth named.<ref name=Valar/> 

==History==
Like her sister, Vána had influence with the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, "all flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming."<ref name=Valar>{{S|IIb}}</ref> She robed herself in flowers and her hair was golden in color.<ref name=Vana>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref> She had "the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works."<ref>{{MR|P3I1}}</ref>

[[Nessa]], the sister of Vána's spouse [[Oromë]], wedded [[Tulkas]] on the [[Almaren|Isle of Almaren]], the Valar's first dwelling. Vána robed Nessa with her flowers for the wedding.<ref>{{MR|P2}}</ref>

Vána dwelt in gardens filled with golden flowers and often came to the forests of Oromë. In the days of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]], the [[Maia]] maiden, [[Arien]], "tended to the golden flowers of the gardens of Vána by watering them with the bright dews from [[Laurelin]]." [[Melian]] was another Maia who initially served Vána and [[Estë]] before she departed to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

After the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the flight of the [[Noldor]] to Middle-earth, most of the [[Valar]] were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumours of [[Melkor]] and his violence nor the murmur of the restless [[Noldor]] to disturb them again. For such reasons, they sought the concealment and protection of their land [[Aman]]. It was said that particularly Vána and [[Nessa]] were of one mind in this matter, in accordance with most of the other Valar, although [[Ulmo]] pled pity and pardon for the Noldoi.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|218}}

== Etymology ==
Vána ([[Quenya|Q]]: "Beauty", pron. {{IPA|[ˈvaːna]}}) or '''Wána''' ([[Vanyarin]], {{IPA|[ˈwaːna]}}) was the name of the [[Vala]] who was also called the Ever-young.<ref name=Valar/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest form of the [[legendarium|mythology]], Vána and [[Oromë]] had a daughter, [[Nielíqui]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, p. 288</ref> Whilst in the origins of the story of the [[Two Trees]], Vána played a formative role in the growth of [[Laurelin]]:
{{blockquote|Then was the pit covered with rich earths that ''[[Palúrien]]'' devised, and Vána came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that [[Ulmo]] had brought from the spilled lakes--yet was ''Kulullin'' almost o'erflowing at the end.<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref>}}

In ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', [[Tolkien]] wrote that when the power of [[Yavanna]] had failed to heal the wounds of the [[Two Trees]], Vána's love for [[Laurelin]] was so great that it caused the tree's remaining life to come forth one last time as a fruit of gold from which the [[Valar]] later fashioned the [[Sun]]. Vána's maiden, [[Arien|Urwen]], would steer the Sun's vessel across the sky. Vána, who repented of speaking against the harvest of Laurelin's last fruit, cut her hair short to weave the tresses as the sails for the Sun-ship.<ref name=Vana/>{{rp|186}}

In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Nienna's tears cleansed the trees and Yavanna's songs brought forth the final bloom of [[Telperion]] and fruit of [[Laurelin]]; Vána was not involved.
