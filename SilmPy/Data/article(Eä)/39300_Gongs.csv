{{rewrite}}{{sources}}'''Gongs''' are evil beings that appear in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the earliest version of what would become ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In his commentary, [[Christopher Tolkien]] remarks that they are obscurely related to [[Orcs]], perhaps as a sub-race of the species. There are no references to Gongs in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s later legendarium and the author appears to have abandoned the concept.

The [[Gnomish]] word ''sithagong'' is glossed as "dragonfly" (''sitha'' being the word for [[flies|fly]]).<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 68</ref>
