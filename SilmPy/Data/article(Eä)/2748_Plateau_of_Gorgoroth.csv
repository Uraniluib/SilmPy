{{Pronounce|Gorgoroth.mp3|Ardamir}}
The '''Plateau of Gorgoroth''' was a high desolate plain in north-western [[Mordor]] enclosed by the [[Ephel Dúath]] on the west and the [[Ered Lithui]] on the north. The only known passages into the plateau through these mountain walls were the [[Carach Angren|Isenmouthe]] (from [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] and the [[Morannon]]), [[Cirith Ungol]], and the [[Morgul Vale]].<ref name="RKmap">{{RK|Map}}</ref> To the south-east, between two arms of the mountain ranges, was a gap that opened upon the land of [[Nurn]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

In this dreary wasteland fumes issued from fissures in the ground and smoke curled and settled in hollows. Centred in the desolation some forty miles east of the Ephel Duath rose [[Mount Doom]]. It and [[Barad-dûr]], situated on a spur of the Ered Lithui, dominated the landscape of the plateau.<ref name="Shadow">{{RK|VI2}}</ref>

==History==
c. {{SA|1000}} [[Sauron]] selected Mordor as his stronghold and began building Barad-dûr above the plateau.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

In {{SA|3434|n}} the host of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] entered Gorgoroth and began their siege of Sauron's fortress, during which (in {{SA|3440|n}}) [[Anárion]] was slain. After seven years the siege ended when Sauron was defeated and his [[The One Ring|Ring]] was taken.<ref name="SA"/>

Sauron returned to Mordor in {{TA|2951}} and began rebuilding Barad-dûr, which had been torn down after his defeat in the Second Age.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] first looked upon Gorgoroth (on [[16 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>) they spied innumerable camps of [[Men]] made of huts and drab buildings, connected by a network of roads. In this region were Sauron's mines and forges for equipping his vast armies.<ref name="Shadow"/>

On [[19 March]], after escaping the Orcs at the Isenmouthe, the hobbits travelled on the road to Barad-dûr along the northern edge of Gorgoroth. Three days later they left the road and headed south across the plateau to Mount Doom, reaching it on [[24 March]].<ref name="Great"/>

==Etymology==
*[[Sindarin]]: ''[[gorgor]]'' "horror, dread"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''gor''</ref> + ''oth''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 233</ref>
