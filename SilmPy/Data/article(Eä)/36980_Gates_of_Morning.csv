The '''Gates of Morning''' were situated somewhere in the [[Uttermost East|East of the World]]. While it is said that the great [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] mariners, from "''their high prows''", glimpsed the Gates of Morning during their travels across the seas, nothing further is known about these Gates.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref><ref>{{LR|P1II}}, pp. 14, 25</ref><ref name=PM>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 149 (note to §13)</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In the mythology of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]'' appears the '''Gates of Morn''' or '''Gates of East''', through which the [[Sun]]ship re-entered the World, after having travelled through the [[Void|Outer Dark]] (the Sun left the World through the [[Door of Night]]).<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, pp. 216, 219</ref>

However, with the "[[Sketch of the Mythology]]" [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] re-thought the astronomical foundations of his mythology,<ref>{{SM|2a}}, "[Section] 6", p. 49</ref> and the Sun passes below the Earth. [[Christopher Tolkien]] has therefore remarked that the re-appearance of such a concept in many versions of the story of ''[[Akallabêth]]'' is astonishing.<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}, p. 20 (note to §3)</ref><ref name=PM/>
