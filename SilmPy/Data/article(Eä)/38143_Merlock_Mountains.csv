The '''Merlock Mountains''' are mentioned in the [[The Shire|Shire]]-poem ''[[The Mewlips]]''.<ref>{{AB|Mewlips}}</ref>  

It is unknown if the Merlock Mountains refer to an actual mountain range in [[Middle-earth]], or if they were just an invention by the poet. As the poem describes a location similar to [[Mirkwood]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Mewlips, the"</ref> it is possible that they were a fictitious version of the [[Misty Mountains]], or what the [[Hobbits]] knew about them.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 260</ref>

==Etymology==

[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that the name ''Merlock'' was inspired by the name ''Morlock'' appearing in Tolkien's earlier poem "[[Knocking at the Door]]" (which was perhaps itself inspired by [[Wikipedia:H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Morlock|Morlock]]'') <ref>{{webcite|author='geordie'|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?25289-Middle-earth-Is-Orbiting-Saturn|articlename=Middle-earth Is Orbiting Saturn (post #3)|dated=26 December 2012|website=Plaza|accessed=15 February 2013}}</ref>
