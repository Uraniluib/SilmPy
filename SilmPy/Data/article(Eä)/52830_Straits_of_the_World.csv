The '''Straits of the World''' was a strait of mountainous land linking the [[Great Gulf]] with the [[Sea of Helcar|Inland Sea of Helcar]] in the [[First Age]] of the world.<ref name=Ambar>{{SM|Ambar}} p. 259</ref> The Straits of the World appears only in early writings<ref name=Ambar>{{SM|Ambar}} p. 259</ref> before Tolkien envisioned the wide lands of [[Eriador]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]] that lay east of the Great Gulf.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] speculated in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' that the Sea of Helcar drained into the Great Gulf at the end of the First Age and that the Straits of the World became the river [[Poros]]. Fonstand's interpretation was predicated on the idea that [[Mordor]] was created in the Second Age where the Sea of Helcar once lay.<ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> However, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (which was published after Fontstad's ''Atlas''), [[Melkor]] was said to have created [[Mount Doom]] in Mordor during the "long [[First Age]]".<ref>{{PM|Last}} p. 390 (note 14)</ref> Additionally, it is told in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that the migration of the [[Drúedain]] from [[Hildórien]] brought them westward through lands south of Mordor.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, pp. 339-340</ref>
