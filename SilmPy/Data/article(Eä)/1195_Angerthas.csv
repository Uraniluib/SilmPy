'''Angerthas''' was a term for [[Runes|Runic]] writing. There were numerous variants, but the two principal forms were the [[Angerthas Daeron]], used by the [[Elves]] to represent [[Sindarin]], and the [[Angerthas Moria]], the classical form used by the [[Dwarves]], which was further evolved to [[Angerthas Erebor]].<ref name=App/>
