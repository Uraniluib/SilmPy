The '''Falas''' was an area on the west coast of [[Beleriand]], facing the [[Belegaer]]. The [[Falathrim]], [[Sindarin]] [[Elves]] ruled by [[Círdan]], dwelt here.
==Geography==
The River [[Brithon]] and the River [[Nenning]] ran into the sea here. The Elves built the [[Havens of the Falas|havens]] of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]]. [[Finrod]] built the tower of [[Barad Nimras]] ("White Horn Tower") on a cape of the Falas between Brithombar and Eglarest.
==History==
The Falas only occasionally enters into the events of the [[First Age]]; in the [[First Battle]] of Beleriand, Morgoth's host overran the Falas and besieged the two havens, but lifted the siege in order to join in the Second Battle. 

[[Nargothrond]] had an alliance with the Falas. During the [[Siege of Angband]] ({{FA|65}})<ref>{{GA|90}}</ref>, the [[Elves of Nargothrond]] aided the Falathrim in rebuilding the two Havens and made them fair and strong. They also built Barad Nimras to watch for attacks from the sea by [[Morgoth]].<ref>{{S|Realms}}</ref>

The Havens of the Falas were finally [[Fall of the Falas|destroyed]] in {{FA|473}}, and Círdan's people fled to the [[Mouths of Sirion]] and the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''falas'' means "surfline, sea-shore" in [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''falas''</ref> deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] PHAL ("foam").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 62</ref>
