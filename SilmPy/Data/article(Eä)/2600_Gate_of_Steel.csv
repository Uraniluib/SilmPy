The '''Gate of Steel''' or '''Last Gate''' was the last of the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin]] both in order of entering and construction, having being built by [[Maeglin]] some centuries after the other six as an ultimate defence after the disaster of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Though all but impassable to an enemy, the Gate ultimately failed to prevent the [[Fall of Gondolin]].

The gate was like a great steel fence across the Orfalch Echor. The fence had seven great needle-like pillars of steel and between these pillars there were seven cross-bars of steel and forty-nine vertical rods with heads like broad blades of spears. In the centre, above the midmost pillar, was raised a mighty image if the king-helm of [[Turgon]], the Crown of the [[Gondolin|Hidden Kingdom]], set about with diamonds. The gate opened inward on either side of the pillar of the Crown. This gate followed the [[Gate of Gold]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
