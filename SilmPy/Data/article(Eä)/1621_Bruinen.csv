'''Bruinen''' or '''Loudwater''' was a river in eastern [[Eriador]].  It began with two tributaries flowing from the western slopes of the [[Misty Mountains]], one of which came from the [[High Pass]] where [[Goblin-town]] existed.  The Bruinen terminated when it joined the [[Mitheithel]] River.  The southern arm of the Bruinen flowed through the deep valley where [[Elrond]] founded the refuge of [[Rivendell]]. The Bruinen had only one known ford, the [[Ford of Bruinen|Ford]] near Rivendell.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

The river formed the eastern border of the Kingdom of [[Arnor]] and later the petty-realm of [[Rhudaur]].  It also formed the northern border of [[Eregion]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==History==
When [[Thorin]] and company went to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], they crossed the Bruinen after their adventure with the [[Trolls]], before they long paused at Rivendell.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[War of the Ring]] [[Frodo Baggins]] was carried on [[Glorfindel]]'s horse towards the Ford of Bruinen, with the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] in hot pursuit. At the Ford Frodo, poisoned by a deadly wound, made his stand, and defied the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]]. This lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] released a great flood, which took the form of horses made out of water due to Gandalf's magic. This flood killed the horses of the Ringwraiths and their physical forms, buying the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] some time.<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Like most rivers in Eriador, the '''Bruinen''' had a Westron name, which Tolkien translated as '''Loudwater'''. [[Patrick H. Wynne]] linked the first element ''brui'' "noisy" to the second element of the word ''[[Ulumúri]]'', and several other [[Qenya]] and [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]] words with some connection to "great sound". The second element is ''[[nen]]'', "water".<ref>[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lambengolmor/message/895 Editorial to Lambengolmor message 895]</ref>
