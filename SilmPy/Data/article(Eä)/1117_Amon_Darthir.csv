'''Amon Darthir''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''[[amon]]'' "steep-sloped mountain" + ''[[dartha]]-'' "to wait") was a mountain in the range of the [[Ered Wethrin]], the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]] that separated [[Dor-lómin]] to the north from [[Beleriand]] to the south.<ref>{{CH|Map}}</ref> It stood near the house of [[Húrin]] in the south-east of [[Dor-lómin]], and the springs of [[Nen Lalaith]] were among its northern slopes. The secret and difficult passes that ran beneath Amon Darthir's peak were the only way through the [[Ered Wethrin]] for many leagues in either direction.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 67</ref>
