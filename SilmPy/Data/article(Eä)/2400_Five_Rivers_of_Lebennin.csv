'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Five Rivers were the Gilrain, the Serni, the Sirith, the Celos, and the [[Erui]]. Each of the rivers was the domain of a River-Maiden, one of the Five Sisters of Lebennin. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the Five Sisters were considered a myth by most of the [[Men]] of Lebennin, though it remained traditional to leave baskets of flowers as offerings to the rivers.
