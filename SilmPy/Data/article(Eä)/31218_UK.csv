__NOTOC__
'''UK''' is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "nasty".<ref>{{VT|48a4}}, p. 25</ref> [[Patrick H. Wynne]] notes that the root is "''apparently an [[Wikipedia:Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] stem''" and that it is "''probably related to the root [[UG]] 'dislike' (whence Q. úra 'nasty')''".<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 32 (note 15, "Editor's Notes")</ref>

In ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Eldarin Roots and Stems]]'' appear the roots "? UK, UKLA" (without any given significations, except for being one of the opposites of [[AYA]]).<ref name=Eldarin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 149, 188</ref> It has been suggested that "''the queried stem uk in this note is perhaps the same as later UK 'nasty'''".<ref>{{VT|49a}}, p. 14</ref><ref group="note">Note that the two different transcriptions have been rendered from the reading of the same manuscript: "? uk: ukla" in [[Vinyar Tengwar 49|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 49]] and "? UK, UKLA" in [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|''Parma Eldalamberon'' XVII]]. Perhaps the latter was editorially changed to the standardized form given to roots.</ref>
