'''Bucklebury''' was the chief village of [[Buckland]], lying in the shadow of [[Buck Hill]], seat of the [[Master of Buckland]]. It was built about a mile east of the banks of the River [[Brandywine]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

The [[Bucklebury Ferry]] was a passage across the [[Brandywine]] between Bucklebury and the [[Marish]].
==Etymology==
The name means Buck-burg, or Buck-town (''buck'' always means male goat or deer).

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that it's "Buck''le''bury" rather than plain "Buckbury" because the word is either an alteration of earlier ''Bucken-bury'' (Bucken being archaic plural) or a reduction of '''''Buckl'''and''.<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 767</ref>

Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested that Bucklebury represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Buccanburh'' "[[Bucca]]'s burg".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
