'''Belthil''' was the silver-flowered tree made by [[Turgon]] in memory of [[Telperion]], one of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]]. Its mate was [[Glingal]].  

==Etymology==
Belthil translates to ''Divine Radiance'', from [[BAL]] = powers, [[THIL]] = shine with white or silver light.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> The original ''a'' became ''e'' due to [[I-affection]]

==Other versions==
Earlier writings name this tree '''Bansil''',<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, ''Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin, Bansil'', p. 214</ref> but this progressed to '''Banthil''', and finally '''Belthil'''.
