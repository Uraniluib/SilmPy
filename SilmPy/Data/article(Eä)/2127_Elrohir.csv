'''Elrohir''' and his twin brother [[Elladan]] were the children of [[Celebrían]] and [[Elrond]]. Dark-haired and grey-eyed, only those that knew them well could tell them apart.

==Description==
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] their elven-fair faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the [[Grey Company]] they wore cloaks of silver-grey over a bright mail.<ref name="PassingGreyCompany"/>

==History==
In the year {{TA|2509}}, the twins' mother Celebrían went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, [[Galadriel]], in the land of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]. In the [[Redhorn Pass]], she was captured by orcs, and tortured in their dens. Elrohir rode with his brother to rescue her, but by the time they reached her she had received a poisonous wound.<ref name="TA"/>  Though their father healed her, she would not remain in [[Middle-earth]], and sailed into the [[Aman|West]] the following year. After this loss, Elladan and Elrohir were filled with hatred of the [[orcs]], often riding against them with the [[Northern Dúnedain]].

In the early part of the [[War of the Ring]], the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]],<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> but later they took a more active part. When [[Halbarad]] rode to [[Aragorn|Aragorn's]] aid with the [[Grey Company]], Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them. They followed Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]], fought with him at [[Pelargir]], and took part in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where they fought with stars bound to their brows.

After the [[War of the Ring]], little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at [[Rivendell]], and remained there even after he had passed across the Sea.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref> Like their sister [[Arwen]], the sons of Elrond [[Half-elven]] were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the [[Undying Lands]], or remain there and become [[Mortals|mortal]] as [[men]]. So they chose for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown.
