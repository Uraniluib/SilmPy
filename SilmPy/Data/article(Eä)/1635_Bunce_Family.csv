The '''Bunce Family''' was a family of [[Hobbits]]. [[Mimosa Bunce]] is the only recorded member of the family.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 

However, according to [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s poem "[[Perry-the-Winkle]]", there was an "old Mrs Bunce" living in [[Michel Delving]]; this character might have been based on an actual Hobbit, or just a character in the Hobbit folklore poetry.<ref>{{AB|Perry}}</ref>
