'''Araphor''' ({{TA|1391}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1589|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 198) was the ninth king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Arveleg I]], upon his death in 1409. 

==History==
Araphor was only eighteen years old when he came to the throne of Arthedain because his father was killed in battle in the defence of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]]. Although young, Araphor was valiant and he avenged his father by repelling the enemy from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]] with the aid of [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]]. The remnant faithful of the [[Dúnedain]] in [[Cardolan]] also helped repel the enemy from the [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]], or took refuge in the [[Old Forest|forest]] behind.

It was during the wars with Angmar, and the reign of Araphor, that the [[Stoors]] living in the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]] (between the rivers [[Hoarwell]] and [[Loudwater]]) continued to move west and south away from Rhudaur out of dread. Some of the Stoors went back over the [[Misty Mountains]] to dwell beside the [[Gladden River|Gladden]] become the fisherfolk from which [[Sméagol]] and [[Déagol]] descended.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Also during Araphor's rule, there were many problems in [[Gondor]] including the [[Kin-strife]], the burning of [[Osgiliath]] (and the loss of its ''[[palantír]]''), and wars with the people of [[Harad]] and [[Umbar]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Araphor ruled for 180 years - the second-longest ruler of the Northern Line (after [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]]) - and was succeeded by his son, [[Argeleb II]], upon his death in {{TA|1589|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Araphor's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Royal Fist" from ''[[ar]]'' meaning "royal", and ''paur'' meaning "fist" (compare with [[Celebrimbor#Etymology|Celebrimbor]]). This could be a reference to Araphor's valiance.
