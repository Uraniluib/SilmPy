'''Ibun''' was the son of [[Mîm]] and brother of [[Khîm]], the last of the [[Petty-dwarves]].<ref name="Mim">{{CH|7}}, p. 132</ref>

==History==
Ibun lived with his family at [[Amon Rûdh]]. They were seen by the [[Gaurwaith]] as they snuck past them carrying heavy sacks. Mîm was captured, and the two brothers fled into the mist. As they ran, Khîm was shot by a wild arrow from the outlaws, but Ibun survived, and shared his father's [[House of Ransom]] with [[Túrin]] and the outlaws.<ref name="Mim"/>

One winter, the two [[Petty-dwarves]] went out in search of roots, and were captured by a band of [[Orcs]]. To save his life Mîm betrayed Túrin to the [[Orcs]], but Ibun's fate is unclear.<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 148</ref>  

Much later, in [[Nargothrond]], Mîm told [[Húrin]], "I am the last of my people",<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> meaning that he outlived both his sons; Ibun either lost his life at the hands of the Orcs, or in some later unrecorded mishap.
