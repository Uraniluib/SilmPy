'''Angrist''' was a knife held by [[Curufin]] and then [[Beren]], of which was said that "iron it would cleave as if it were green wood". 

==History==
Angrist was made by the [[Dwarves|dwarf]]-smith [[Telchar]] for the [[Elves|Elf]]-lord [[Curufin]] in the [[First Age]]. 

It was worn by him, sheathless by his side, when he and [[Celegorm]] attacked [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]] and [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] in the forest of [[Brethil]], attempting to kidnap the latter. The brothers lost the fight and the knife, along with other spoils, was taken from Curufin. 

During the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], Beren used it to cut through the [[Iron Crown]] of [[Morgoth]] and free a [[Silmaril]]. However, its blade snapped as he tried to cut a second jewel and Morgoth stirred as a shard grazed his cheek. Beren left Angrist behind as he escaped.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

==Etymology==

Angrist means "Iron Cleaver" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[ang]]'' = "iron" and ''[[crist]]'' = "cleaver", "sword").

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==

In [[Quenta Noldorinwa]] the knife of Curufin remained unnamed and it was referred to as "the knife of the treacherous Dwarves". Also, there it is stated that its maker was a dwarf from [[Belegost]], not one of [[Nogrod]].
