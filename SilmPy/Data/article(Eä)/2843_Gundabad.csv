'''Mount Gundabad''' was a mountain adjacent to the northern reaches of the [[Misty Mountains]].  It was revered by the [[Dwarves]] but usually occupied by [[Orcs]].

==Description==
From the northern part of the [[Vales of Anduin]], Mount Gundabad appeared to be the northern endpoint of the [[Misty Mountains]] and the western endpoint of the [[Grey Mountains]], although slightly separated from both ranges.<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> In actuality, the Misty Mountains continued past Mount Gundabad in a north-westerly direction (this extension was known as the [[Mountains of Angmar]]).  In all maps the mountain was shown as having three conjoined peaks. Bordering [[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]] to the north, the mountain undoubtedly had a cold climate.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
According to the [[Dwarves]], [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]], eldest of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], awoke at Mount Gundabad shortly after the [[Awakening of the Elves]].  From that time forward the mountain was revered by the Dwarves.<ref name="Relations">{{PM|Relations}},p. 301</ref>  However, since Durin awoke alone he did not stay at the mountain; he walked southward until he discovered [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  In the early ages Mount Gundabad did serve as a place of assembly for delegations of Dwarves, yet there is no mention of any making permanent residence there.<ref name="Relations"/>
 
In {{SA|1695}} [[Sauron]] invaded [[Eriador]].  In {{SA|1697|n}} he conquered [[Eregion]]<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> and would have overwhelmed [[Elrond]], leading refugees northward, but he was attacked in the rear by forces sent from Khazad-dûm.  Sauron drove the Dwarves back but could not breach the [[Doors of Durin]]. Frustrated, he commanded the Orcs to harry the Dwarves wherever they could be found.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>  Soon thereafter came the [[First Sacking of Gundabad]], followed by a long occupation by Orcs.<ref name="Relations"/>
 
Around the year {{TA|1300}} the realm of [[Angmar]] arose.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Its lands lay on both sides of the Misty Mountains<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> so Mount Gundabad was part of its domains.  Although Angmar was destroyed in {{TA|1975|n}}<ref name="TA"/> and the last remnants of its people east of the mountains were driven away<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> in {{TA|1977|n}},<ref name="TA"/> Gundabad itself remained populated with Orcs.
 
After the death of King [[Thrór]] in {{TA|2790|n}} the Dwarves gathered for vengeance.  The [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] began in {{TA|2793|n}}<ref name="TA"/> and the [[Second Sacking of Gundabad]] occurred.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> Although it is likely that the Dwarves cleared the mountain of all Orcs, afterwards the Orcs returned and Mount Gundabad again served as their capital in the North.<ref name="Burst">{{H|Burst}}</ref>
 
In {{TA|2941|n}}<ref name="TA"/> [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]], [[Gandalf]], several Dwarves, and [[Bilbo Baggins]] entered the Misty Mountains.  While in the mountains the [[Great Goblin]] was killed and the party escaped.  Furious, the Orcs gathered at Mount Gundabad under the command of [[Bolg]] to seek revenge.  Hearing of the death of [[Smaug]] they marched on the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name="Burst"/>  However, the Orcs lost the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and three parts of their numbers.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>  Orcs still lived at Mount Gundabad by the end of the [[Third Age]] but in a very reduced state.

==Etymology==
''Gundabad'' is said to be a "in origin a [[Khuzdul]] name". Its meaning, however, is unknown.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, p. 301</ref>

A recogniseable element is Khuzdul ''[[gundu]]'', meaning "underground hall", but it is not known if this word is indeed part of the name ''Gundabad''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm|articlename=Khuzdul|website=Arda|accessed=}}</ref>
