'''Elendil''' was the father of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], a survivor of the [[Downfall of Númenor]], and the founder and first King of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. 

Elendil was also known as '''Elendil the Tall''', being the tallest of Men who escaped the Downfall (mentioned to be almost 2.5 [[Ranga|rangar]] tall, 7'11" or 2.41 m).<ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref> He was also known as '''Elendil the Fair'''.

==History==
Elendil was born in [[Númenor]]. He was the son of [[Amandil]], [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] and leader of the [[Faithful]] [[Númenóreans]]. He was probably named after his ancestor, [[Tar-Elendil]], an ancient [[King of Númenor]]; his name also signified his and his family's devotion and friendship to the [[Elves]] as [[Elf-friend]]s, preserving the old beliefs in [[Ilúvatar]] and reverence for the [[Valar]]. Like his father, he stood against the barbarous practices of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] the King and [[Sauron]] his advisor.

On the advice of his father, who foresaw the coming destruction of Númenor, Elendil put nine ships off the eastern coast and loaded all his people and possessions aboard them. Amandil then followed the actions of their ancestor, [[Eärendil]] and left Númenor attempting to warn the Valar of their King's folly.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

When the catastrophic [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] occurred in {{SA|3319}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> Elendil, his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], and their supporters fled to [[Middle-earth]], sailing east in the nine ships. With them they took the ''[[palantíri]]'', the "Seeing Stones" that were given to the Lords of Andúnië by the Elves of [[Tol Eressëa]], the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], the [[Ring of Barahir]], [[Narsil]] which Elendil kept as his sword, and a seedling of [[White Tree of Númenor|Nimloth]], the White Tree of Númenor.<ref name="Akallabeth"/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Ships of the Faithful.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Ships of the Faithful'']]
The ships became separated during the tumultuous voyage to Middle-earth; while Isildur and Anárion landed in the more southerly lands near the haven of the Faithful at [[Pelargir]], Elendil and his people arrived at the northwest near [[Lindon]]. For this reason there were two kingdoms of the Númenóreans in exile, [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> After Elendil finally landed in Middle-earth, he proclaimed in [[Quenya]]: "''Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta''" ("Out of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world"). His heir and great-grandson by 39 generations [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] spoke these words again when he took up the crown of Gondor as King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] at the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

Elendil founded the city of [[Annúminas]] in Arnor. His son Anárion established the city of [[Minas Anor]] in [[Anórien]], and Isildur founded [[Minas Ithil]] in [[Ithilien]]. Elendil however ruled as [[High King of the Dúnedain]]. In both realms were built towers for the ''palantíri'', with which the lords kept contact.<ref name="Rings"/>

The evil lord Sauron, having lost his shape in the Downfall of Númenor, returned to Middle-earth as a shadow and a black wind over the sea. It came to [[Mordor]], next to Gondor, where Sauron wrought a new guise.<ref name="Akallabeth"/> In {{SA|3429}} Sauron attacked, seizing [[Minas Ithil]]. Isildur fled north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of Gondor. In response, Elendil formed an alliance with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to repel Sauron's assault. It is said that Elendil bound the [[Last Alliance]] with an oath and invoked the name of [[Eru]] to witness it.<ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

In {{SA|3434|n}}, the combined forces returned south together and fought in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] of Elves and Men. Elendil fought valiantly at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]].

At the end of the long [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], in the year {{SA|3441}}, Sauron came out to personally do battle. Gil-galad and Elendil fought Sauron and cast him down, but were both slain,<ref name="SA"/> and Elendil's sword [[Narsil]] was broken when he fell.  His son Isildur used the broken sword to cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron's hand. However, despite the urgings of [[Elrond]], Isildur chose not to destroy the Ring at [[Mount Doom]] and was eventually betrayed by the Ring in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], slain by [[Orcs]].<ref name="Rings"/>

==Legacy==
Elendil was a great warrior, a wise king, and a heroic figure among the [[Dúnedain]] and other [[Dúnedain|Men of the West]]. Isildur built a hidden [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb for his father]] on the summit of the beacon hill of [[Halifirien]]. Its presence was considered great enough to hallow the entire hill, hence its name (''Halifirien'' means "holy mountain" in [[Rohirric]]).<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

After the founding of [[Rohan]], the [[Steward]] [[Cirion]] moved Elendil's remains to the [[Hallows]] of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="Cirion"/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Elendil.mp3|Ardamir}}
Elendil's name actually means "Devoted to the Stars" in [[Quenya]]. 

For the [[Dúnedain]] it was intended to signify "[[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]]" ([[Adûnaic]] ''[[Nimruzîr]]''), since they tended to confuse the Quenya element EL for both "Elf" and "star".

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Elendil.jpg|Elendil in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''|right|thumb|150px]]
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:In the film's prologue, Elendil is played by [[Peter McKenzie]]. Unlike in the books, Elendil is killed by a blow of [[Sauron]] instead of having a part in destroying him with [[Gil-galad]]. Instead, [[Isildur]] deals the fatal blow to the still-living Sauron by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of [[Narsil]], and, with them, the [[The One Ring|ring of power]].
