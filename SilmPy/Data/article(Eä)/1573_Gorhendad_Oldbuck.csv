'''Gorhendad Oldbuck''' was a [[Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], the founder of [[Buckland]] and of the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] family.

==History==
Gorhendad Oldbuck of the [[Marish]] crossed the [[Brandywine]] in {{SR|740}}<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> and founded [[Buckland]] and [[Brandy Hall]]. In honor of their new land, he changed his family name from Oldbuck ([[Hobbitish|H.]] ''[[Zaragamba]]'') to [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] (H. ''[[Brandagamba]]''). He ruled the land, as [[Master of Buckland]], as his own realm, and his family became even wealthier than they already were.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref> Their removal from [[the Shire]] meant [[Thain]]ship passed to the [[Took Family]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Gorhendad himself was the ancestor of the Masters of Buckland.

==Etymology==
''Gorhendad'' is the translation of [[Westron]] ''Ogmandab''<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 8</ref> (in an earlier manuscript version spelled ''Ogforgad''<ref name="granddad">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>) which, according to Stoor tradition, used to mean "great-grandfather".<ref name="granddad"/> ''Gorhendad'' is the modern [[Welsh]] word for "great-grandfather".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 115</ref><ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', p. 10</ref>
