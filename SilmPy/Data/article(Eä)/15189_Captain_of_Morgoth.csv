The '''Captain of Morgoth''' in the west during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or ''Battle of Unnumbered Tears'' was the leader of the host from [[Morgoth]] that assailed [[Fingon]] at [[Eithel Sirion]].

He most probably perished in the charge of [[Elves]] initiated by [[Gwindor]] and joined by the host of Fingon. This charge "swept away and destroyed" the evil host and passed on to [[Angband]].

The Captain had been commanded by Morgoth to ensure Fingon's force was brought to battle as early as possible so they could not have the opportunity to outflank Morgoth's main army.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

It is not known whether the Captain of Morgoth was an [[Orcs|Orc]], [[Troll]], [[Balrogs|Balrog]], or some other beast.
