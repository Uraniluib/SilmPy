'''Dryads''', or '''spirits of the wood''', were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in linguistic writings. Their [[Qenya|Elvish]] names were ''tavaro'' or ''tavaron'' (masc. sing.) and ''tavaril'' (fem. sing.), derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[TAW#Other versions of the legendarium|T√ÅWAR]] ("wood, forest").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 391</ref><ref>{{VT|36a}}, p. 13</ref>

In one letter, [[Tolkien]] explores the possibility that the [[Ents]] were "[[spirits|souls]]" that were sent to inhabit (animate) trees, or that became trees themselves.<ref>{{L|247}}</ref>
