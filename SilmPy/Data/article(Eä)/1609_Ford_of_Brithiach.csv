The '''Ford of Brithiach''' was an important ford of the River [[Sirion]]. The crossing was in the upper part of the river's course, on the northern borders of [[Brethil]] just south of where the [[Dry River]] once flowed into the Sirion. A road led across it from [[West Beleriand]] into [[Dimbar]], and then on into the perilous valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  Below the ford there was no means of crossing the river until it reached [[Doriath]].<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 118</ref>  

[[HÃºrin]] and [[Huor]] were pursued by [[Orcs]] to the ford where they would have perished but that [[Ulmo]] raised a mist from the Sirion that hid them while they crossed the Brithiach into Dimbar.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 35</ref>
==Etymology==
The ford is often referred to simply as "The Brithiach", a name that comes from the [[Elvish]] for 'gravel crossing' ([[Sindarin]] ''[[brith]]'' "gravel" + ''[[iach]]'' "ford").
