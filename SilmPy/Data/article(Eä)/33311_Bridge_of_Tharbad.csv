The '''Bridge of Tharbad''' was where the [[North-South Road]] crossed the [[Gwathl√≥]] River within the town of [[Tharbad]].

==History==
After their founding, both of the kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] shared an interest in [[Enedwaith]], although it belonged to neither.  Since the great North-South Road was the chief route of communication between the two kingdoms together they built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad.  Long causeways carried the road to the bridge and a considerable garrison of soldiers, mariners and engineers were kept nearby.  However, after the [[Great Plague]] came in {{TA|1636}} the region fell quickly into decay.  By the time that [[Boromir]] made his great journey from Gondor to [[Rivendell]] the causeways were crumbling remains, Tharbad was reduced to dwindling mounds, and the ruins of the bridge had formed a dangerous ford. <ref>{{UT|6}}</ref> Boromir lost his horse at the ruined bridge.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>
