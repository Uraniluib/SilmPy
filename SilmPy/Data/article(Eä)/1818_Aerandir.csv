'''Aerandir''' was one of the three mariners (together with [[Erellont]] and [[Falathar]]) to accompany [[Eärendil]] on his voyage to [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref><ref group=note>[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never specified the race of the three mariners, thus only speculation can be made whether they were [[Men]] (cf. [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/aerandir.html Encyclopedia of Arda]) or [[Elves]] (cf. [http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=347256&page=73 this game forum thread])</ref>

==Etymology==
''Aerandir'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "Sea-wanderer" (''[[aer]]'' + ''[[randir]]'').<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

The name for the character appearing in an early manuscript was ''Airandir'',<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 324</ref> a form later rejected by Tolkien.<ref>{{WJ|Last}}, p. 246</ref>
