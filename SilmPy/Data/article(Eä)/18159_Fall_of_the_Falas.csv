The '''Fall of the Falas''' was a battle that followed the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], when [[Morgoth]] launched his attack on the elvish lands in northern [[Beleriand]].  It is not, however, counted among the major battles of the First Age, and it ended in the destruction of the [[Falas]] and the death of many [[Elves]].

==History==
After the Nírnaeth, orcs and wolves roamed Beleriand freely, while Morgoth prepared for a final assault to seize all the north.  The Falas, commonly known as the Havens, was a popular place for refugees.  [[Círdan]], the great lord of the Falas, sent mariners to harass enemy units, knowing the battle that was coming.  The twin cities of the Falas, [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]], were strong, and their walls were high.

A year later, in the autumn, Morgoth invaded from [[Hithlum]] and [[Nevrast]].  His armies ravaged the countryside as they went, laying siege to Brithombar and Eglarest.  The Elves resisted valiantly, but in the armies of Morgoth were skilled engineers who built mighty siege-engines which broke the walls.  [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and most of the elves were killed.  But Círdan himself escaped with a remnant, including the [[Noldor]]in prince [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], aboard the ships.  They sailed to the [[Isle of Balar]] and continued to welcome refugees, but the Falas were no more.
