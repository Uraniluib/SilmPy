The '''''Erulaitalë''''' was one of the [[Three Prayers]] that the [[King of Númenor|Kings]] and [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queens]] of [[Númenor]] and their people made to [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]. It was observed in the middle of summer. The ''Erulaitalë'' was a ceremony in which praise was given to Eru for his works. During this ceremony, the ruler of Númenor and his or her people ascended the [[Meneltarma]] and made a bloodless offering on its summit.

==Etymology==
The word ''Erulaitalë'' means 'Praise of Eru' in [[Quenya]] (from the verb ''[[laita-]]'', 'to praise', and the nominalizing suffix ''[[-lë]]'').
