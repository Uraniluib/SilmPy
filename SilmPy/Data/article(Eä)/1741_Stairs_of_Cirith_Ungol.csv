{{disambig-more|Cirith Ungol|[[Cirith Ungol (disambiguation)]]}}
The '''Stairs of Cirith Ungol''' were a pair of steep stairs cut into the [[Ephel DÃºath|Mountains of Shadow]] on the borders of [[Mordor]]. They led upward and away from [[Minas Morgul]], the city that guarded the main pass through the mountains, to reach [[Cirith Ungol]], a higher and lesser pass guarded by the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. The first of the stairs was the steepest, the [[Straight Stair]], which led up to a narrow passage that seemed to go on for miles. After that came the second set of stairs, the [[Winding Stair]], which led up to Cirith Ungol itself.<ref>{{TT|IV8}}</ref> 

We're never told for sure who made the Stairs: they may have been originally carved by [[Sauron]]'s servants, or perhaps later by the [[Gondorians]] at the same time as they raised the Tower to guard the pass. Whatever their origin, they were no secret to the [[Orcs]] that inhabited the Tower in the later [[Third Age]], though [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] were still able to use them to find a dangerous way into the [[Mordor|Black Land]].
