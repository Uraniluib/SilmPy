}}'''Eldarion''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[elˈdari.on]}}) was the son of [[Arwen]] and [[Aragorn|Elessar]]. His birth marked the reunion of the lines of [[Eärendil]]'s sons [[Elros]] (through Aragorn) and [[Elrond]] (through Arwen) separated for millennia. Also, he represented (through [[Galadriel]]) the union of the [[Edain|Three Houses of the Edain]] with the ancient [[House of Finarfin]].

==History==
Eldarion became the second King of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] after the death of his father Elessar in {{FoA|120}}. He was also recorded to have several sisters.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

One hundred years into his reign, he encountered a renewal of [[Morgoth]]-worship known as the "[[Dark Tree]]".<ref>{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>

In a 1972 letter concerning ''[[The New Shadow]]'', Tolkien mentioned that Eldarion's reign would have lasted for about 100 years after the death of Aragorn.<ref name="L338"/>
==Etymology==
His name in [[Quenya]] means "Scion of the [[Eldar]]". In [[Letter 338]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spelled this name '''Eldaron''', this is probably a typographic error.<ref name="L338"/>
