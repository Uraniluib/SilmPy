'''Morwen Steelsheen''', also called '''Morwen of Lossarnach''', was the queen to King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], and mother of his heir [[Théoden]].

==History==

Morwen was a woman of [[Belfalas]], of the [[Prince of Dol Amroth]]'s kin, though her family later moved to the flowery vales of [[Lossarnach]].<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> She was seventeen years younger than her husband; Thengel wedded her late in his life ({{TA|2943}}), and they lived for a time in her homeland of [[Lossarnach]]. When his father [[Fengel]] died, Thengel inherited the [[King of Rohan|Kingship of Rohan]], and travelled with Morwen back to his own land. Morwen bore five children in all, including Thengel's heir Théoden, and his sister [[Théodwyn]], who would be the mother of [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]]. She was called Steelsheen because of her grace.<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 

Morwen was dark-haired and considerably taller than most of the Rohirrim, owing to her High-[[Númenórean]] heritage. The descendants of Thengel, including their grandson [[Éomer]], were said to have inherited many of her characteristics, including his size.<ref name="Isen"/><ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''[[Morwen]]'' is the name of a famous member of the [[House of Bëor]] in the first age. It translates from [[Sindarin]] as "black(haired) woman".
