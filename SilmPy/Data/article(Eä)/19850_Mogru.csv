'''Mogru''' was a [[Men|man]] who held the position of town-master in [[Agar]] during the [[Second Age]]. He is described as a "fat man with eyes like a lizard", who had much power among his kind.

As he received the ill news of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ships approaching, from [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]] and [[Hazad Longbeard]], he mocked them and refused to believe such story, for the Númenóreans had not arrived in that land during his lifetime. However, at their request, he walked with difficulty towards a hill from where he could see the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].  By then the ships that Tal-Elmar had seen were too close to the hilly shore to be spotted.  Due to the fact that he hated Tal-Elmar and his blunt way of speaking to him, without showing the respect he believed he was deserving, Mogru sent Tal-Elmar ahead to the ships, as a scout.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>

The fate of Mogru it is not known further.
