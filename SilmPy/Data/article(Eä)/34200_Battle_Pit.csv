The '''Battle Pit''' was the burial place for the ruffians killed in the [[Battle of Bywater]].

On  [[3 November]] {{TA|3019}}, 100 [[Ruffians]] fought over 300 [[Hobbits|hobbits]] on the [[Bywater Road]].  The Ruffians had foolishly walked into a trap within a banked portion of the road (which the hobbits secured with barricades at either end).  In the ensuing fight nearly seventy of the [[Men|men]] died.  The victorious hobbits loaded the bodies of their foes into wagons and hauled them to an old, nearby sand-pit for burial, which thereafter was called the Battle Pit.  Nineteen hobbits also died in the fray but they were buried separately, with honor in a hill-side grave.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
