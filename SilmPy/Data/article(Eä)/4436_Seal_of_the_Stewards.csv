The '''Seal of the Stewards'''' was the seal of the [[Stewards of Gondor]], consisting of the letters R·ND·R below three stars. The letters represent the word [[Arandur]]. This is the actual [[Elvish]] title, literally meaning '[[King's Servant]]', that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] renders into English as 'Steward'.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 25</ref>

When the twelfth Steward, [[Cirion]], sent north to [[Eorl]] for aid in his desperate wars, he sent the Seal incised upon a small stone with each of six riders. Only one of these, named [[Borondir]], succeeded in reaching the nation of the [[Éothéod]], but from this came the famous [[Ride of Eorl]] and the foundation of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (ii) ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>
