'''Firefoot''' was the horse ridden by [[Éomer]] of the [[Rohirrim]], at least on the journey from [[Edoras]] to [[Helm's Deep]] (during which [[Gimli]] was also a passenger on Firefoot's back).<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref> Firefoot is never specifically described, but we can probably gain an impression of the animal's appearance from the other horses of Éomer's [[éored]]: large and grey-coated with a braided mane and a long tail.
