'''Gram''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2668|n}} – {{TA|2741|n}}, aged 73 years) was the eighth [[King of Rohan]]. 

==History==
Gram was the son of [[Déor]] and father of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] and [[Hild]]. His reign was a time of warfare with the [[Dunlendings]], who had occupied [[Isengard]] during his father's time, and continued to raid and harass the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Tolkien]] comments that the name in [[Old Norse]] has the meaning "warrior, King", which is not the case with recorded Old English (where ''[[Wiktionary:gram#Old English|gram]]'' means "fierce, grim, hostile"). However he presupposes some poetic influence of [[Northern Mannish]] upon [[Rohirric]] (similar to the influence between Old Norse and Old English), after which the name can be understood as such.<ref>{{L|250}}</ref>
