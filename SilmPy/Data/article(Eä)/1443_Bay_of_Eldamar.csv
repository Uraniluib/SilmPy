The '''Bay of Eldamar''' was a wide bay in the coasts of [[Aman]], on the western shores of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. It was here that the island of [[Tol Eressëa]] finally came to be anchored, and for many years the [[Teleri]] dwelt on that island. Eventually, [[Ossë]] guided them across the windless surface of the Bay to its shore, where they dwelt in the haven of [[Alqualondë]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

The Bay of Eldamar was visited long afterwards by one possessing (some) mortal blood, none other than [[Eärendil]] the Mariner. He anchored [[Vingilot]] his ship in the Bay while he entered the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]] on his embassy to the Powers who dwelt there.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==In other stories==
The Bay of Eldamar is referenced in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]''. In the story, written down in [[1927]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes the enchanted dog [[Rover|Roverandom]] (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the [[Shadowy Seas]] to the "Bay of Fairyland" beyond the [[Enchanted Isles|Magic Isles]] where Rover saw the [[Pelóri|Mountains of Elvenhome]] and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of [[Tirion|a city of Elves on a green hill far away in the distance]].<ref name="Roverandom">{{HM|R}}, pp. 73-4</ref>
