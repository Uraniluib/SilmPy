'''Mount Gram''' was a mountain inhabited by [[Orcs]].

==History==
Mount Gram was inhabited by [[Orcs]] led by their King [[Golfimbul]]. In {{TA|2747}} they attacked much of northern [[Eriador]], but were defeated in the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

==Location==
The location of Mount Gram has never been established and the mountain could have been anywhere within the northern [[Eriador]] region.

The [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]] mentions that in {{TA|2740}} "Orcs ''renew'' their invasions of Eriador", obviously referring to [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|those of the Misty Mountains]], mentioned in the immediate previous entries.<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref> "The [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] of Mount Gram" who invaded the Shire in {{TA|2747|n}} obviously were a subsequent wave of them.

This must be the reason why [[Robert Foster]] considers Gram to have been one of the Misty Mountains, although he does not cite a specific source or reason to do so.<ref name=Foster/>

On the other hand, [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (also without explanation) placed it on a promontory in the [[Ettenmoors]].<ref name=Atlas/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest writings of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Mount Gram was merely "Gram Hill".<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 8</ref>

==Etymology and inspiration==
[[Gram]] in [[Old English]] means "fierce, grim" but it is not certain that the name was intended as Old English.

There is a Mount Gram in Albania.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
