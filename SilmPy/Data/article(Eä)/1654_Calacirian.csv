__NOTOC__

'''Calacirian''' was a region of [[Eldamar]] near the entrance to the ravine of [[Calacirya]]. The hill of [[Túna]] stood there, with the city of [[Tirion]] built upon it. The light of the [[Two Trees]] was the strongest there in all Eldamar.

The name appears in [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] [[Song of Eärendil]] in [[Rivendell]]:<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref><ref name=RGEO>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 70</ref>
