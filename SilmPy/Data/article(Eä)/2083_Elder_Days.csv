'''Elder Days''' was a term that, during the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]], properly referred to the times before the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name=appb/> In that context, the [[Middle Days]] were the Second and Third Ages, whereas the [[Younger Days]] were the foreseen [[Dominion of Men]].<ref name=council>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

However, in the [[Fourth Age]] the term began to be applied to all previous [[Ages]], as the time before the [[Dominion of Men]] and the dwindling of the [[Elves]] and other races.<ref name=appb>{{App|B}}</ref> [[Aragorn]] for instance, referred to himself as the last King of the Elder Days, according to the latter sense.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that the word "Elder" has deliberately an archaic flavour, since it is now only applied to persons (Elders = seniors). He also pointed to an association with the poetic word ''eld'' 'old age, antiquity'. 

Early English had the expression ''Ãže eldern dawes'' 'in the days of our forefathers, long ago, Days of the Seniors'.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 780</ref>
