'''Silvan Elvish''' was a name for the tongue spoken by the [[Silvan Elves]].
==History==
Silvan Elvish descended from Nandorin, the language of the Nandor. 

In later centuries, their language became known as Silvan Elvish, heard both in [[Lothlórien]] and the [[Woodland Realm]] of [[Mirkwood]]. 

After the [[First Age]], the surviving Elves of [[Beleriand]] carried their speech back into the east. [[Sindarin]]-speakers settled in both the main Silvan realms, and in Lórien, at least, Sindarin quickly overtook Silvan Elvish in common use. The history of the tongue in Mirkwood is more difficult to determine - some sources suggest that it, too, was quickly overtaken by Sindarin, but other sources dispute this. 

By the end of the [[Third Age]], the only remnants of Silvan were a few names, like '''[[Caras Galadhon]]''' or '''[[Amroth]]''', which sound like Sindarin, but actually betray the influences of Silvan words.
==Names==
[[Legolas]] calls the dialect the "''woodland tongue''".<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

In one note [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] calls the language just Silvan.<ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, p. 182 (commentary to §42)</ref>
