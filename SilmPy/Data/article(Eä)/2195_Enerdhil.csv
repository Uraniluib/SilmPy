'''Enerdhil''' was a legendary, and quite possibly mythical, [[Noldor|Noldorin]]<ref name="Elessar">{{UT|Elessar}}</ref> smith of [[Gondolin]]. According to one account, it was Enerdhil who made the original [[Elessar of E채rendil|Elessar]], an astonishing green gem through which marred and broken things could be seen as though whole and healed again. This Elessar was given as a gift to [[Idril|Idril Celebrindal]], and given by her to her son [[E채rendil]], who bore it on his voyages across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref name="Elessar">{{UT|Elessar}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[David Salo]] suggests that the name is a loan from [[Quenya]] ''[[Anardil]]'' meaning "sun-friend". 

The [[Sindarin]] form of the name displays what he calls "hyper-[[Sindarization]]", with [[i-affection]] before the ending ''[[-ndil]]'' whereas it shouldn't occur in "proper" Sindarin.<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p.87</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
More recent accounts name [[Celebrimbor]] as the maker of the two Elessars, both E채rendil's and [[Aragorn]]'s.<ref name="Elessar"/>

The fact that there are two possible Elessars makes Enerdhil fit into the mythos, as the first one could have been made by him and [[Elfstone|the second]] by Celebrimbor. But not even this has been resolved clearly.
