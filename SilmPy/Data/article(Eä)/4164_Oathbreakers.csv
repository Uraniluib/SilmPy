The '''Oathbreakers''', also known as the '''Dead Men of Dunharrow''', were the shades of [[Men]] of the [[White Mountains]]. 

==History==
They were originally the  Men of the Mountains. Their people descended from the [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean]] peoples related to the [[Dunlendings]] and flourished during the [[Second Age]]. They had worshipped [[Sauron]] in the [[Dark Years]] before the foundation of [[Gondor]].

After Gondor was founded, [[King of the Dead|their King]] swore allegiance to [[Isildur]] and the [[Dúnedain]] in the last years of the [[Second Age]]. But when the time came for them to fulfil their oath, and fight beside Isildur against their ancient master, they broke their word; they refused to join the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]], and hid in the mountains. 

Isildur cursed them to remain without rest until their oath was fulfilled. Waiting for the [[Heir of Isildur]] to appear and grant them the chance to fulfil their word at last, they haunted the caverns beneath the [[Dwimorberg]]. It was said that when their [[wraiths]] appeared in the valley of [[Harrowdale]] that lay in the mountain's shadow, also known as the [[Paths of the Dead]], it was in times of trouble or death. 

In the [[War of the Ring]], Isildur's Heir, [[Aragorn]], called on the oathbreakers to fulfil their oath at last. They followed him through the [[Gondor|Gondorian]] lands south of the [[White Mountains]], and at the port of [[Pelargir]] they drove away the allies of [[Sauron]] in fear. For their aid, Aragorn granted them their freedom, and they vanished at last from the world.

==Names==
Before breaking their oath, these men were known simply as the '''Men of the Mountains'''. Afterward, they were referred to as the '''Dead of Dunharrow''', the '''Sleepless Dead''' or just the '''Dead''', the '''Grey Host''', the '''Shadow Host''', the '''Shadow-men''', the '''Shadows of Men''' or simply the '''[[Shadow]]s'''.

The "Army of the Dead" was only used in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Dead were originally envisioned as walking skeletons, but this had to be revised after ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' came out and did something similar with its undead hosts. So these dead men are glowing green ghosts. Contrary to the book, the Dead follow [[Aragorn]] all the way to [[Minas Tirith]], and cleaned up all [[Sauron]]'s troops. It is after this that they are ultimately set free.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Oathbreakers of Dunharrow are the inspiration for several other factions of Oathbreakers and other cursed shades, such as former soldiers of [[Arthedain]] cursed for betraying [[Fornost]] to the forces of [[Angmar]]. The King of the Dead was named Rioc. Some of the Dead Men of Dunharrow refused to follow Aragorn, and reaffirmed their allegiance to Sauron. These were known as the Ruthless Dead.
