== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Section VII "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]", it was explained that three manuscripts existed in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the Southern Line of Gondor, and appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Eärendil lived from {{TA}} 40 to 316 instead of {{TA|48}} to {{TA|324|n}}.<ref name="Elendil"/>
