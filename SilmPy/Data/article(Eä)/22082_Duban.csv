'''duban'''  means "valley, dale" in [[Khuzdul]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]] p. 269</ref>
==Etymology==
[[SundocarmÃ«|Root]] *D-B-N
==Other versions==
The word ''duban'' exists according to the explanation of ''[[Azanulbizar]]'' "Dimrill Dale" that denies that ''[[bizar]]'' is itself the word for "dale, valley". By this interpretation, the full name of the vale is ''duban Azanulbizar'', but the initial element may be left out and understood. In this case, ''bizar'' means "stream, rill".
