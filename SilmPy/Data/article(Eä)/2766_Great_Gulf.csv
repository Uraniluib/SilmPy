The '''Great Gulf''' was an immense gulf that divided [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]] from southern regions of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[First Age]].<ref name="Coming"/>

==History==
The Great Gulf was created in the [[War for Sake of the Elves]], when the [[Valar]] waged war against [[Melkor]] after they discovered the first [[Elves]]. As a result of the war, [[Belegaer]] broke into Middle-earth, forming the Great Gulf and several lesser bays to its north, including the [[Bay of Balar]].<ref name="Coming">{{S|3}}</ref><ref>{{SM|A5}}</ref>

==Geography==
South of the river [[Gelion]], "the land narrowed suddenly" and gave way to the Great Gulf.<ref name="Ambar"/> The Great Gulf almost touched the [[Blue Mountains]],<ref name="Ambar">{{SM|5}}, p. 306</ref> but the land around the southern end of the mountain chain was wide enough to allow travellers to pass between [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]].<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p. 109</ref><ref>{{PM|X}}, p. 307</ref><ref group=note>The Great Gulf was originally depicted in the [[Ambarkanta]] as being separated from the Inland [[Sea of Helcar]] to its east by a narrow strip of mountainous land called the [[Straits of the World]]. See {{SM|A5}} and p. 306. However, this depiction predates Tolkien's conception of the wide lands of Eriador, Gondor, and Mordor that lay east of the Blue Mountains, as well as the non-mountainous passageway connecting Eriador and Beleriand that lay between the Great Gulf and the Blue Mountains.</ref>

After the [[War of Wrath]], most of Beleriand was drowned, and much of the Great Gulf would have vanished with it. Although not explicitly stated, the eastern end of the Great Gulf in Eriador likely became the [[Bay of Belfalas]].
