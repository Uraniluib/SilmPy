The '''Elves of Nargothrond''' were those who followed [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and dwelt under his rule in the underground citadel of [[Nargothrond]] on the banks of the River [[Narog]].
==History==
For the most part of the [[First Age]], the Elves of Nargothrond remained hidden and isolated, waging a guerilla war against the forces of [[Morgoth]], ambushing but never assaulting them directly in open warfare. Spies and scouts of Nargothrond guarded [[Talath Dirnen]], the plains between Nargothrond and [[Doriath]].<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 110</ref>

The realm of Nargothrond extended westward to the [[Sea]] and the Elves were allied to the [[Falathrim]]. With their help they built ships and some of them explored the [[Isle of Balar]], thinking to prepare it as a last refuge in time of need.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>

However they also participated in major events of the Age, as during [[Dagor Bragollach]], when Finrod and his army came north to stop the onslaught. In that skirmish, they were ambushed at the [[Fen of Serech]] but a sortie by [[Barahir]] rescued them, and allowed them to retreat. Finrod pledged to Barahir for saving him. After the Battle, [[Sauron]] attacked [[Tol Sirion]], and it was lost thereafter.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

In order to repay this pledge, Finrod and a company of ten Elves of Nargothrond participated also in the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] to assist [[Beren]], Leaving [[Orodreth]] to rule in his place. These Elves were captured by [[Sauron]] in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], and were devoured one by one, including Finrod.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

A small army from Nargothrond also joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] in order to avenge losses of the previous battle, but [[Gwindor]]'s premature assault led to the disastrous [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref>

After that battle, most of [[Beleriand]] was under the power of [[Angband]] and there was a massive orc-buildup nearby. [[Túrin Turambar]] came to Nargothrond and gained influence among the Elves. Against the counsels of [[Ulmo]], he persuaded the forces of Nargothrond to turn into open war against the [[Orcs]]. This led to the disastrous [[Battle of Tumhalad]] which all but exterminated the army of Nargothrond, and King Orodreth was killed. [[Glaurung]] the Worm led Orcs to the [[Sack of Nargothrond]] where all women were taken prisoners, and taken by the [[Crossings of Teiglin]]; the [[Haladin]] of [[Brethil]] came to their rescue in vain; the Orcs managed to kill all their captives.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

The fate of any survivors or their descendants is unknown; Nargothrond disappears from history as it remained deserted until the deluge of Beleriand in the [[War of Wrath]],<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> but some members of the [[House of Finrod]] lingered in [[Middle-earth]] until the late [[Third Age]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier stages the Elves of Nargothrond were known as Rodothlim or Rothwarin. Their name meant "cavern-dwellers".<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 347</ref> The leader of those Elves had been always [[Orodreth]].<ref>{{LT2 | II}}, p. 82</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Nargothrond is referred as ''Hlydingaburg'' "City of the '''Hlydingas'''".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
