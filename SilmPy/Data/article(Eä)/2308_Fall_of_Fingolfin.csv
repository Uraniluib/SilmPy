The '''Fall of Fingolfin''' was a name given to the noble yet hopeless end of [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]]. After the destruction of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], he rode in anger to the gates of [[Angband]], and challenged [[Morgoth]] himself to single combat. Though he fought bravely, he could not hope to best the [[Dark Lord]], and he was lost.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
