'''Soronúmë''' was one of the constellations that [[Varda]] traced in the sky with the dews of [[Telperion]], before the [[Awakening of the Elves]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> The name means "Eagle of the West" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[soron]]'', "[[eagle]]" and ''[[númen|númë]]'', "[[West (disambiguation)|West]]"). 
==Inspiration==
The translation suggests a connection with the constellation we know today as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila_%28constellation%29 Aquila], but this was never confirmed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]. The constellation now known as Lyra may also be considered, as its former name in Arabic was ''an-nasr al-wāqi‘'' "falling eagle" (giving its name to its main star [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega Vega]).<ref>Identification with Aquila or possibly Lyra: Cf. for instance [[Kristine Larsen]], "Myth, Milky Way, and the Mysteries of Tolkien’s ''Morwinyon'', ''Telumendil'', and ''Anarríma''" in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'', vol. [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 7|7]], 2010, p. 203. In her conclusion on p. 207, Larsen retains Aquila.</ref>
