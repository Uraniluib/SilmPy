The '''Ring of Thrór''' was the first of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Dwarf-rings]] to be forged, and the last to be recovered by [[Sauron]]. 

While Sauron himself gave the [[Dwarves]] their [[Rings of Power]]<ref>{{S|V}}</ref>, this one was originally given to King [[Durin III]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] by [[Celebrimbor]]<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>, and it remained in his line for thousands of years until it was inherited by [[Thrór]], the [[King under the Mountain]]. 

The [[Kings of Durin's Folk]] proved resistant to the malevolent magic of the rings, which could not even turn them invisible, as they are hard to tame, and thoughts of their hearts are hidden.<ref name=ring>{{S|Rings}}</ref> The rings, used only for the gaining of wealth, amplified their wearer's natural skills and desire of dominion which as a consequence, made them greedy and exceedingly rich; the Rings gave them the power to multiply whatever they mined.<ref name="a">{{HM|AA}}</ref>

It was during Thrór's reign that [[Smaug]] descended on the [[Lonely Mountain]] and drove the [[Dwarves]] into exile. Long after his kingdom's destruction, Thrór passed the ring to his son [[Thráin]], who dwelt for many years as an exile from his ancient home.

At last, Thráin set out on an ill-fated quest to regain his kingdom, but he was captured by the spies of [[Sauron]], and the Ring of Thrór was lost forever.

Many Dwarves, however, did not know the fate of the Ring, and thought that it was lost in [[Moria]] when Thrór was killed by [[Azog]]. It was thought that one of the reasons [[Balin]] wished to [[Balin's Colony|reclaim Moria]] was to find the Ring. In the [[Council of Elrond]], [[Gandalf]] told [[Glóin]] that Balin would not find the Ring there, as it was given to Thráin and lost in [[Dol Guldur]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Ring of Thrór does not appear itself, but is named as "Angya", and is called "Handórm" by the Dwarves. Gandalf believes it to have been destroyed in the downfall of [[Barad-dûr]].
