'''Robin Smallburrow''' was a [[Shirriff]] from [[Hobbiton]].
__NOTOC__
==History==
Born and raised in [[Hobbiton]], Robin was of old a friend of the [[Gamgee Family|Gamgee]]s. He loved being outdoors, and became a [[Shirriff]] so he could meet new people (and, equally important, inns).<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

Originally one of only twelve,<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> during [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' reign, Robin found himself in over his head. He was reassigned to the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]] in [[Frogmorton]], tasked with enforcing The Rules. 

Robin was one of the Shirriffs sent to arrest [[Travellers|four Hobbits]] who had illegally entered the Shire at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. It was more of an escort than an arrest, as Robin and his troops were on foot and the four Hobbits had ponies. At the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], the Shirriffs gave up and let their prisoners go on without them.<ref name="Scouring"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Smallburrow" may imply Robin came from a poor family, as only the poor and the rich lived in [[smials]]. His name bears some resemblance to the mythical [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/puckrobin/puckbals.html Robin Goodfellow].
