'''Aravorn''' ({{TA|2497}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|2654|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 157) was the ninth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]].

==History==
Aravorn succeeded his father, [[Aragost]], when he died in {{TA|2588|n}}. Aravorn's rule seems to be uneventful as the enemy centered a lot of its attacks on the newly-formed [[Rohan]].

Aravorn died in 2654, after having ruled as chieftain for 66 years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Arahad II]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Aravorn's name is [[Sindarin]], though its exact meaning is unclear. The first element is ''[[aran]]'', "king", but the second could be ''[[boron|born]]'', "steadfast", or ''[[morn]]'', "darkness", which both become ''vorn'' through [[lenition]].
