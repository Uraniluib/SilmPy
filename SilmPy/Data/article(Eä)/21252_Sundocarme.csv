{{quote|Roots are in capitals, and are not words in use at all, but serve as an elucidation of the words grouped together and a connection between them.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s note in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]''<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>}}
'''Sundocarmë''' or "Base-structure" is the title of a section in Tolkien's [[Tengwesta Qenderinwa]] (''Quendian Grammar'') dealing with the three main shapes of [[Elvish]] etymological roots and their modifications.<ref>{{PE|18}}, p. 84</ref> All [[Elvish]] and [[Mannish]] words (and in a sense, also [[Khuzdul]]) derive from a base root or [[sundo]].

Roots are not actual words, but bases that contain the general meanings, and from which, during the process of evolution and times, real words were derived through affixes, suffixes, or modifications.

In the very first phase of the [[Primitive Quendian]], roots were probably used as actual words; in that period the Elves could speak only through uninflected words, without any differentiation between parts of the speech (Tradition says that the very first word ever said by an Elf was ''el-e!'', a primitive exclamation "look!", referring to a star).

The consonantal frame of the root was called [[canta]] and the central radical vowel called [[sundóma]].

==Categories==
Roots usually have the construction combinations:

*VC or CV (examples: K<sup>W</sup>E "speak"; this category is called ''monoconsonantic'')
*(C)VCV (examples: [[DELE]]- "walk", [[ABA]]- "deny"; this category was preferred for meanings related to actions/verbs)
*CVC(V) (examples: [[TATA]]- "two", [[TUR]]- "power, control")

==Examples==
These are some of the roots, with their derivatives in various languages
