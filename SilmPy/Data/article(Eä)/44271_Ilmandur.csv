'''Ilmandur''' was supposed to be eldest of the three sons of Elendil, who only appears in the third version of the manuscript of "[[The Council of Elrond]]" where [[Elrond]] tells how the sons of [[Elendil]] governed  the three cities of Gondor, but Tolkien struck out the name in pencil.<ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 119</ref>

According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], Ilmandur was probably meant to be the lord of [[Osgiliath]], as [[Ilmen]] in his name means the realm of stars, ''giliath'' in [[Sindarin]], present in the name Osgiliath.<ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 122</ref>
