'''Harry Goatleaf''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] and a member of the [[Goatleaf Family]]. He worked as the keeper of the [[West-gate of Bree|western gate]] in the great hedge that surrounded the township of [[Bree]].

As such, he was the first of the [[Men]] ([[Big Folk]]) encountered by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions on their travels during the [[War of the Ring]] - he greeted them gruffly on their arrival at the town. He was later present in [[the Prancing Pony]] doing suspicious actions, as it was later discovered he was under the power of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

Some months after the hobbits' departure, Harry, together with [[Bill Ferny]], joined with a band of brigands from the south, causing trouble that left five of the [[Bree-landers]] dead.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> After that, he left Bree with other ruffians, presumably to join [[Ruffians|Sharkey's Men]] in [[the Shire]].
