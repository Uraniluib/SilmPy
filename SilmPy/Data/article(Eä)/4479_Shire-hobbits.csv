The '''Shire-hobbits''' or '''Shire-folk''' were the [[Hobbits]] that lived in [[the Shire]], as opposed to [[Bree-hobbits]] and [[Buckland]]ers. They represented the majority of the whole Hobbitish population of [[Middle-earth]]. Shire-hobbits called everyone else "[[Outsiders]]".

The Hobbits of the Shire were considered the most rustic and pastoral of their kind. The most important family among the Shire-hobbits were the [[Took Family|Tooks]] of the [[Westfarthing]], who had held the hereditary, and largely honorary, title of [[Thain]] from {{TA|2340}}.
