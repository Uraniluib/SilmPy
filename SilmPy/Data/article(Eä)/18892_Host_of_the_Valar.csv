The '''Host of the Valar''' or '''[[Host of the West]]''' was the mighty army that overthrew [[Morgoth]] and his legions at the end of the [[First Age]]. 

The army itself was composed of [[Vanyar]] under [[Ingwion]]<ref>{{WJ|Last}}</ref>, and the remaining Noldor of [[Valinor]], under [[Finarfin]]. [[Manwë]]'s herald [[Eönwë]] came with them, and possibly other [[Maiar]] and some [[Valar]] also joined the Host.<ref group=note>No other [[Ainur]] are mentioned, but Eönwë's presence alone is an indication that other Maiar would accompany him, if not some Valar as well. This is implied by the name "Host of the Valar" itself as well as the cataclysmic result of the War which drowned [[Beleriand]]. Cf. {{HM|Guide}}, p. 202 and [[Michael Martinez]]'s [http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/10/10/how-was-beleriand-destroyed-in-the-war-of-wrath/ article]: " It would be reasonable to infer that some of the Valar also accompanied the Host — presumably [[Tulkas]] and [[Oromë]] would have wanted to be included in that conflict."</ref>

They were brought to [[Middle-earth]] by the ships of [[Falmari]], who took pity on the words of [[Elwing]]; however the Falmari refused to fight beside the Noldor, remembering the [[First Kinslaying]].

The Host of the West met Morgoth's [[Host of the North]] in the titanic clash of the [[War of Wrath]]. Assisted by the [[Great Eagles]] and [[Earendil]], they were victorious.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>
