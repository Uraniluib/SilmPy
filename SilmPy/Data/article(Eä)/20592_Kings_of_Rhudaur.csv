The '''Kings of Rhudaur''' were the hereditary rulers of [[Rhudaur]], a splinter kingdom of [[Arnor]].

The first king of Rhudaur was the third and youngest son of [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] who following his father's death in {{TA|861}} disputed the ascension of his elder brother [[Amlaith]] to the throne and declared himself king of an independent realm. 

Rhudaur itself was the most isolated and inhospitable of the northern kingdoms, and it would seem that a significant number of the king's subjects were native [[Hill-men]] who resented rule by [[Númenóreans]]. At some point after {{TA|1300}}<ref group="note">The date of the foundation of [[Angmar]]</ref> this group, with the support of [[Angmar]], usurped the throne of Rhudaur and drove out the [[Dúnedain]]. The usurped dynasty, if any survived, presumably sought refuge in Arthedain or Cardolan.

The Hill-men Kings of Rhudaur ruled for some time as vassals of [[Angmar]]. Apparently however they were not very successful as by {{TA|1409}} the region was almost completely depopulated. At this time Rhudaur was finally annexed by Angmar and the its kingship was terminated.
