'''Angamaitë''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "Iron-handed", pron. {{IPA|[ˌaŋɡaˈma͡ɪtɛ]}}) was one of the great-grandsons of [[Castamir]] the Usurper. 

With [[Sangahyando]], another descendant of [[Castamir]], Angamaitë followed in the footsteps of his treacherous ancestor and were leaders of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. 

Spies informed them that [[Minardil]], the [[King of Gondor]], was in the [[Gondor]]ian port of [[Pelargir]] in {{TA|1634}}. Quickly the pair led the Corsairs on a devastating raid against the port, where they succeeded in ravaging the city and slaying the King.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Minardil, p. 199</ref>
