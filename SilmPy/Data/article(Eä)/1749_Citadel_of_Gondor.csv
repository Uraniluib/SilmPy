[[File:Ted Nasmith - At the Court of the Fountain.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''At the Court of the Fountain'']]'''Citadel of Gondor''' was a term sometimes used loosely of [[Minas Tirith]] in [[Gondor]], but in fact strictly referring to the fortified seventh and highest circle of that city.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

It was the city's strongest point, surrounded by high walls and battlements on the 'keel'. One reached the Citadel through the Seventh Gate, manned by the [[Guards of the Citadel]].

The Citadel housed the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]], the [[Tower of Ecthelion]] and its court with the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]].  There were also the [[King's House]], lodgings for the Steward, [[Merethrond]], barracks for the Guard, and other buildings for guests and other workers.
