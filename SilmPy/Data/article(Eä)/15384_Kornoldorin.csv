'''Kornoldorin''', "Noldorin of [[Kôr]]", or '''Korolambë''', "Tongue of [[Kôr]]", was the language of the [[Noldoli]] in [[Valinor]]. The Noldor used it beside [[Qenya]], but unlike Qenya, it changed fast as the Noldor devised new words and structures by themselves.<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>

Old Noldorin shares several attested words with Qenya (like ''[[malina]], [[míre]], [[parma]], [[randa]], [[rauta]], [[rimba]], [[rimbe]], [[ringe]], [[runda]], [[sír|sīre]], [[yaiwe]]'') and [[Telerin]] (''[[branda]], [[Bana]], [[belda]]'').<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>

The language also presented several minor changes of vowels and consonants over Telerin; compare T. ''[[alpa]]'' "swan" vs ON. ''[[alpha]]'' (which brought Noldorin ''[[alph]]'')

In the [[Great Lands]], the language evolved as [[Noldorin]] through contact with [[Ilkorin]].
==Canonicity==
In the stage of the later ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] rearranged several details: the language described as Old Noldorin is taken by the Noldorin dialect of [[Quenya]], and the language called Noldorin was renamed "[[Sindarin]]" and took the place of the vernacular Ilkorin in [[Beleriand]].

Old Noldorin belongs to a chronological and phonological stage which Sindarin would normally also have passed through, specifically a stage when final vowels still existed, and consonants did not undergo [[lenition]] yet; however this stage is not named or described by Tolkien other than some example etymological reconstructions.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}</ref> Fans name this phase "[[Old Sindarin]]".
