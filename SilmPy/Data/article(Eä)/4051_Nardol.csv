'''Nardol''' was the third [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Beacon]] of [[Gondor]]. It stood on the broad end of a ridge of the [[White Mountains]], west of the [[Drúadan Forest]], and the guard station maintained there could create a huge signal fire when needed. It was well-stored with fuel and at need a great blaze could be lit. Its fire could be visible on a clear night even as far as the [[Amon Anwar|Halifirien]] (some 120 miles to the west). The guard of Nardol also protected the quarries.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 510</ref>

A line of hills ran from Nardol to [[Amon Dîn]].<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>

On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Nardol'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "fire-hilltop" (''[[naur]]'' "fire" + ''[[dol]]'' "hill"), because its beacon-fire was so bright.<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 19</ref>
