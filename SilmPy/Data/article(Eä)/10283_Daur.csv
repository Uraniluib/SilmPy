==''Daur'' in the Song of Praise== 

The Sindarin word '''''Daur''''' appears in the song of praise of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] at the [[Field of Cormallen]].<ref>{{L|230}}, p. 308</ref><ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref>

It has been suggested that ''daur'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''[[taur#Noldorin|taur]]'' ("lofty, noble" or "king"),<ref>[[Didier Willis]], [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] at [http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com] (accessed 19 June 2011)</ref><ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin, the Noble Tongue: I. Soft Mutation] at [[Ardalambion]] (accessed 9 July 2011)</ref>, however the reliability of this speculation has been contested as the syntax of the phrase does not seem to require lenition.<ref>Alfred W. Tueting, "[http://www.fa-kuan.muc.de/SINDARIN.RXML Some Questions on Sindarin Lenition]" (accessed 9 July 2011)</ref>

When analyzing the song of praise, Tolkien derived ''Daur'' from ''dāra'' "wise" with a [[Quenya]] form ''tāra''. This replaces an earlier version from ''ndāra'' with [[Quenya]] ''nāra''. He also queried the possibility of ''daur'' coming from lenition of base ''t''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 102</ref>
