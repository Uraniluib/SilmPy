'''Harrowdale''' was the name given to the deep north-south valley cut out of the [[White Mountains]] by the [[Snowbourn]] River. At its southern end, beneath the mountain [[Starkhorn]], stood [[Dunharrow]], an ancient structure of the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]], later used as refuge of the [[Rohirrim]]. 

Hamlets in the dale were [[Underharrow]] and [[Upbourn]]. At its northern end, where the Snowbourn issued onto the plains of [[Rohan]], stood Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]].

During the [[War of the Ring]] the Lord of Harrowdale was [[Dúnhere]]. It was there that the muster of [[Rohan]] took place before [[Théoden]] led his riders to [[Minas Tirith]]<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref> and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where Théoden and Dúnhere were killed.
