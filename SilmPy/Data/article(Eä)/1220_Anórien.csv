}}'''Anórien''' was a region and fiefdom of [[Gondor]].
==History==
During the [[Elder Days]], the region was occupied by [[Pre-Númenóreans]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> These were separated relatives of the [[House of Haleth]] while the [[Edain]] migrated to the west during the [[First Age]]. The aboriginal [[Drúedain|Woses]] fled to the forests of that region, hunted by the [[Men of Darkness]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>

At the end of the [[Second Age]], the region was given to [[Anárion]] as part of the [[Realms in Exile]] and was named 'Anórien' after him. Anárion built [[Minas Anor]] on [[Hill of Guard|Amon Tirith]] of the [[Mindolluin]].

Peoples from Anórien, as well as from [[Ithilien]] and [[Calenardhon]] joined with [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] against [[Castamir]] in the [[Kin-strife]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

As the [[Great Plague]] spread, cities were evacuated and many fled to [[Ithilien]] and Anórien.

Steward [[Túrin II]] fortified the isle of [[Cair Andros]] to defend Anórien.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], when [[Sauron]] released a secondary force from the [[Morannon]], they overwhelmed the defenders of [[Cair Andros]], and used the island to cross into Anórien. They blocked the eastward progress of the [[Rohirrim]] as they rode to Gondor's aid, though after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], [[Elfhelm]] and 3000 Rohirrim chased them down and pushed them back out of Anórien.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

==Geography==
Anórien lay north of the line of the [[White Mountains]], and formed a narrow strip of land consisting of the valleys of the [[White Mountains]], and its borders were the [[Mering Stream]] in the west, and the Mouths of the [[Entwash]] in the north. Its eastern border was the border of [[Gondor]] at the [[Anduin]].

After [[Calenardhon]] was given to the [[Éothéod]] to become the Kingdom of [[Rohan]], Anórien remained as the only part of the northern half of the realm. 

The [[Greenway]] road traversed the fief.

The land contained the [[Drúadan Forest]] and fertile farmlands. Except Minas Anor, no cities were in Anórien, but following the line of the [[North-South Road]] that led through [[Rohan]] to [[Arnor]] were built the [[Warning beacons of Gondor]].

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]] for 'Sun-land'; ''[[Sun|Anor]]'' "sun" and ''[[-ien]]'' place name suffix. Called [[Sunlending]] by the [[Rohirrim]]. 

The name does not refer to the [[Sun]] or the climate, but is 'heraldic', related to the name and the emblem of [[Anárion]], son of [[Elendil]]: the land is immediately attached to the [[Minas Anor]].<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>
