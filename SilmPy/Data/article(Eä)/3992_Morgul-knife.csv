==History==

At [[Weathertop]], during his journey to [[Rivendell]] with [[the One Ring]],  the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Frodo Baggins]] was stabbed by the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> A fragment of the blade remained within the wound, working its way toward his heart and threatening to turn Frodo into a [[Wraiths|wraith]].<ref name=FRII1>{{FR|II1}}</ref> [[Elrond]] was able to remove the shard and heal the wound,<ref name=FRII1/> but each year on the anniversary of his stabbing Frodo became seriously ill. Only his eventual departure to [[Eldamar]] offered a permanent cure.{{fact}}

[[Athelas]] (or Kingsfoil) was known to slow the poisonous effect of the morgul-blade. This treatment was also effective against other [[Mordor]] illnesses, such as the [[Black Breath]].<ref name="House">{{RK|V8}}</ref>
