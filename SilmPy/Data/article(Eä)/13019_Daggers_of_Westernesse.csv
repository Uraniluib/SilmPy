The '''Daggers of Westernesse''' were weapons that [[Tom Bombadil]] brought out of the mound in which [[Frodo Baggins]] and his friends had been imprisoned.  Each dagger had a long, leaf-shaped blade, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold.  They had black sheaths of an unknown metal, light and strong, adorned with fiery stones.  Despite their great age they were sharp and unrusted by time.<ref name="Fog">{{FR|I8}}</ref>

==History==
The daggers were created by the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Cardolan]] during their war against the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]].  They were made for fighting forces sent from [[Angmar]].<ref name="Fog"/>  After the fall of Cardolan, at least four of these daggers ended up in the tomb of the last prince of that realm who fell in {{TA|1409}}.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

On [[28 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] became lost in the [[Barrow-downs]] and were captured by one of the [[Barrow-wights|wights]] and imprisoned in the tomb.  Frodo was able to call [[Tom Bombadil]] to their aid, and he opened the tomb and drove the wight away.  Tom gave each of them a dagger from the tomb and told them their history.<ref name="Fog"/>

Frodo's dagger was broken by the Witch King at the Ford of [[Bruinen]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>

Merry laid his sword in the lap of King [[Théoden]] on [[6 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="Great"/> offering service to him.  The king gladly made Merry an esquire of [[Rohan]] of the household of [[Meduseld]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

When Pippin came before [[Denethor]] in [[Minas Tirith]] on [[9 March]]<ref name="Great"/> he offered his sword to the Steward in token of service.  Denethor smiled at first but was impressed by the dagger, recognizing it as coming from his own [[Dúnedain of Arnor|kindred in the North]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

On [[15 March]]<ref name="Great"/> during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Merry stabbed the Witch-king in the back of the knee with his dagger, which enabled [[Éowyn]] to thrust her sword into his face.<ref name="Fields">{{RK|V6}}</ref>

{{quote|But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his stroke went wide, driving into the ground. Merry's sword had stabbed him from behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]"}}

The dagger that Merry stabbed into the Witch-king had a power beyond mere metal, for it broke the spell that held the spirit's body together.  However, after Merry's blow the blade of the dagger writhed and withered, vanishing like a dry branch in a fire. Thus while the blade was created centuries before to battle against the forces of Angmar, it contributed to the demise of the Witch-king.<ref name="Fields"/>

{{quote|So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse.  But glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the North-kingdom when the Dúnedain were young, and chief among their foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king.  No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.|''The Return of the King'', "The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"}}
==Inspiration==
Swords that dwindle can be seen in the Volsungasaga and the Nibelungenlied. In ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', the sword melts "like ice" after decapitating Grendel and his mother.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>
