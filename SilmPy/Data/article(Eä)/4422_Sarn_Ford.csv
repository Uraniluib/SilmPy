'''Sarn Ford''' was the stone ford on the River [[Baranduin]], on the far southern borders of [[the Shire]]. It was guarded by the [[Rangers of the North]].  However, on [[22 September]] {{TA|3018}}, the Rangers were driven off by the arrival in the evening of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

A road beginning at [[Michel Delving]] crossed the ford, which met the [[Greenway]] further south. By this road [[Khamûl]] the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]] entered the Shire during the [[War of the Ring]].

==Etymology==

''Sarn Ford'' was so named by the [[Númenóreans]], after [[Sarn Athrad]] in [[Beleriand]].<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 163</ref>

The name is a half-translation of the [[Elvish]] ([[Sindarin]]) name ''[[Sarn Athrad|Sarn-athrad]]'', meaning "stony-ford" (''[[sarn]]'' + ''[[athrad]]'').<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref><ref name="RC"/>

==Inspirations==
Perhaps [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by the landscape of his childhood: "''Hall Green village was only a little distance away [from Sarehole] down a lane and '''across a ford.'''''".<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''</ref>
