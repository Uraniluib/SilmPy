'''Drengist''' was a firth in [[Beleriand]]. It broke through the [[Ered Lómin]] and ended in the [[Cirith Ninniach]]. The lands to the north were known as [[Lammoth]], and to the south lay [[Nevrast]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
[[Fëanor]] and the [[Noldor]] landed on the shores of Drengist, and their ships were burned at [[Losgar]], which was located at the outlet of the bay.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref> From there, Fëanor and his host pierced into [[Hithlum]].<ref>{{S|13}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In an early manuscript by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], ''Drengist'' is glossed as the [[Elvish]] equivalent of [[Old English]] ''Nearufléot''. The latter name is said by [[Christopher Tolkien]] to consist of ''[[Wiktionary:nearu|nearu]]'' ("narrow") + ''[[Wiktionary:fleet#English|fléot]]'' ("arm of the sea, estuary, firth").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 210</ref> The Elvish etymology of the name ''Drengist'' itself, however, appears to have been nowhere explained by Tolkien.<!-- Here could follow referenced suggestion(s) on how to interpret the Elvish name, I would suggest (User:Morgan) -->
