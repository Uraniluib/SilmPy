{{main|Undeeps}}
The '''North Undeep''' was one of two westward bends of the river [[Anduin]] located between [[The Wold]] and the [[Brown Lands]] (the other being the [[South Undeep]]).  The upper part of the North Undeep also bordered the [[Field of Celebrant]] and was where the river [[Limlight]] joined the Great River.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  Both of the Undeeps had many shallows and wide shoals that afforded an easy crossing for armies,<ref>{{UT|6c}}</ref> which occurred a number of times during the history of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]].
