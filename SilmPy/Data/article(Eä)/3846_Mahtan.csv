}}'''Mahtan''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈmaxtan]}}) was a [[Noldor|Noldorin]] [[Elves|Elf]] and the father of [[Nerdanel]], the wife of [[Fëanor]].<ref name="Feanor">{{S|Feanor}}</ref>

A skilled smith in [[Valinor]], Mahtan learned the arts of metal and stone work under the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Aulë]], and for this Mahtan was also called '''''[[Aulendur]]''''' ("Servant of Aulë"). He wore a [[copper]] circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for the metal. Thus he was called [[Urundil]] - 'copper-lover'.<ref name="Name">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 61</ref> Mahtan in turn taught Fëanor,<ref name="Feanor"/> the greatest of all Elven craftsmen, who—to Mahtan's regret—used this knowledge to forge the first weapons and armour in Valinor.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

Mahtan had a beard, which was unusual for an Elf, especially one as young as he. Elves could only grow beards from the third [[Elven life cycle|cycle of their lives]], while Mahtan was an exception in being only early in his second.<ref>{{VT|41b}}, p. 9</ref>
 
==Etymology==
The name '''Mahtan''' seems to come from the [[Quenya]] ''mahta-'' ("to handle"), a reference to the arts and skills of making. His devotion to Aulë had earned him the name '''Aulendur''' ("Servant of Aulë")<ref name="Name"/> from ''[[-ndur]]'' ("to serve"). The earlier form of this name was Aulendil, which was later used by [[Sauron]] during his treachery to [[Númenor]]. His other name '''Urundil''' means "Copper-lover"<ref name="Name"/> from ''urun'' ("copper") and ''[[-ndil]]'' ("lover, friend").<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref> His other [[epessë]] '''Rusco''' means "Fox", a reference to his red-brown hair.<ref name=Sons>{{PM|Feanor}}</ref>{{rp|353}}
