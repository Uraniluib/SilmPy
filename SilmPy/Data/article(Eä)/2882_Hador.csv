{{Pronounce|Hador Lorindol.mp3|Ardamir}}

'''Hador Lórindol''' ({{FA|390}}–{{FA|455|n}}, aged 65 years) was a [[Men|Man]], the founder of the [[House of Hador]] which was the [[Third House of the Edain]].  He was the son of [[Hathol]] who was the great-grandson of [[Marach]] their forefather. Hador and his wife [[Gildis]] had three children: the first child was their only daughter ''[[Glóredhel]]'', the second child was their elder son [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]], and the third child was their younger son [[Gundor]].<ref name="Hador">{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador''</ref>

==History==
Hador's ancestor, [[Malach]], spent 14 years in the Kingdom of [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]], and became friendly with the Elves.  Although neither Hador's grandfather [[Magor]] nor his father [[Hathol]] served under any Elf-lord,<ref name="Hador"/> Hador entered Fingolfin's household and was beloved by the king.<ref name="Swest"/>  In {{FA|416}} Fingolfin granted Hador a hereditary fiefdom in [[Dor-lómin]], where he gathered most of the people of his kin, thus forming the noble '''[[House of Hador]]'''.<ref>{{GA|136}}</ref>  To celebrate the event, prince [[Fingon]] presented him with the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]], for whom it was also called the [[Helm of Hador]].<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Words of Húrin and Morgoth''</ref>

Noble Hador was remembered as an [[Elf-friend]] (in his household only [[Elvish]] was spoken), the greatest chieftain of the Edain and peer of Elven-lords, and his House became the greatest of the [[Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]]. He ruled Dor-lómin for 32 years until the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. He commanded the rearguard of his liege Fingolfin at the spring of [[Eithel Sirion]], but was slain along with his youngest son Gundor. In his honor, his descendants would call themselves the [[House of Hador]].<ref name="Ruin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
For the etymology of ''Hador'', see the article ''[[Hador (word)]]''.

Hador's epithet, ''[[Lórindol]]'', is [[Sindarin]] for "[[Goldenhead]]" (from ''[[glor]]-'' = "golden light" and ''[[dôl]]'' = "head"), a reference to his golden hair. It was a trait shared by many other members of his House.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an earlier version it was [[Hador Lórindol]] who led the people of the third house of the Edain across the [[Ered Luin]] into [[Beleriand]]; this was changed so that Hador became Marach's descendant of the fourth generation.<ref name="Hador"/>

In both the ''[[Grey Annals]]''<ref name="GAbirth"/> and ''The folk of Marach'' family tree in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]''<ref name="Hador"/> Hador's date of birth was given as {{FA|390}} while his date of death was {{FA|455}}, which meant that he lived for 65 years.  However, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' it is said that when he died he was "sixty and six years of age".<ref name="Ruin"/>
