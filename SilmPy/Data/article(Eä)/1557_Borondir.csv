'''Borondir Udalraph''' (died [[15 April]], {{TA|2510}}) was a [[Gondor|Gondorian]] soldier with some [[Éothéod|Northern]] blood: a forefather was a Captain of the Northmen who served under the [[Steward]] of Gondor. He was described as brave and an excellent rider.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

==History==
Borondir was one of six riders sent out by Steward [[Cirion]] to seek the aid of the Northmen when the [[Balchoth]] threatened Gondor's northern borders. He was the only one to reach [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]] alive, and brought him the [[Red Arrow]] and the Seal of the Stewards. On the journey South, he showed knowledge  of [[Lothlórien]]; he understood the strange mist they had to pass was not magic from [[Dol Guldur]], but rather an effort by [[Galadriel]] to stop such magic. 

Borondir brought the Northmen to the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], but did not survive the battle. His body was taken to the [[Silent Street]], and his name and deeds were remembered in song: ''[[Rochon Methestel]]'', "Rider of Last Hope".<ref name="Cirion"/>

==Other names==
Borondir's epithet '''Udalraph''' means "the Stirrupless"; he was a rider who did not need stirrups, like the Northmen.<ref name="Cirion"/>
