'''Caradhras''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[kaˈraðras]}}) was one of the mightiest peaks in the [[Misty Mountains]].

==The Mountain==
[[File:Tom Cross - Caradhras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tom Cross]] - ''Caradhras'']]
Caradhras was the tallest and northernmost of the [[Mountains of Moria]], the three mountains which the great [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] was built under. The other two were [[Celebdil]] (''Silvertine'') and [[Fanuidhol]] (''Cloudyhead''). Caradhras was described as "mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides". In the light of the rising or setting sun it appeared "dull red as if stained with blood".

Caradhras was called ''the Cruel'' by the Dwarves and had long had a bad reputation.<ref name="South"/> It was the site in Middle-earth where ''[[mithril]]'' was found and where [[Durin's Folk|Dwarves]] woke [[Durin's Bane]], the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Moria]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==The Redhorn Gate==
<!--"Redhorn Pass" in "Eriador#Foundation of the Shire" links here-->
The '''Redhorn Gate''' (also called the ''Redhorn Pass'') was a narrow and dangerous pass through the [[Misty Mountains]] that led from the wilds of [[Eriador]] through to [[Rhovanion]] beyond. Sheer and steep, it climbed across the southern slopes of [[Caradhras]] and led down into the [[Dimrill Dale]] and hence the Vale of [[Anduin]] beyond the [[Mountains]].<ref name="South"/>

The Redhorn Gate was known to be treacherous. It was on this pass in {{TA|2509}} that [[Celebrían]], the wife of [[Elrond]], was captured by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> This was also the pass used by the hobbits migrating from [[Gladden Fields]] into [[Eriador]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

After the fall of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], this pass was predominantly used by elves travelling between Lothlórien and Eriador. On [[11 January]] - [[12 January|12]], {{TA|3019}}, the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] attempted to cross the Misty Mountains by the Redhorn Gate.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> They came into a fierce blizzard and could not go any further due to the deep snow. So they were defeated by the ill will of the mountain and were forced to cross under the Misty Mountains through the Mines of Moria.<ref name="South"/>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]] and means '''Redhorn'''. It is composed of ''[[caran]]'' "red" and ''[[ras]]'' "horn". As a compound, the contact of ''n'' next to ''r'' presents a phenomenon similar to ''[[prestanneth]]'': ''Cara'''n-r'''as'' is assimilated to ''Cara'''dhr'''as''.

'''[[Barazinbar]]''' (or also '''Baraz''') is the literal [[Khuzdul]] translation of "Redhorn".

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' 
:The violent snowstorms on the mountain are seen to have been caused by [[Saruman]] and not the mountain itself. In his [[magic|spell]], Saruman mentions the [[Neo-Elvish|neo-Quenya]] name of Caradhras as ''Carnirassë''.<ref>{{webcite|website=ELF|articlename=Dialogs in FotR|articleurl=http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_fotr.htm#spell|accessed=30 December 2018}}</ref>

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Pass of Caradhras, as well as the Redhorn Gate are featured in the region of [[Eregion]]. The snowstorms are very strong in this area, and an avalanche prevents further travel to the lands of the east.
