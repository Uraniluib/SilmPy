'''Afterlithe''' was the seventh month of [[the Shire]] Calendar, following, as its name suggests, the midsummer feastdays of [[Lithe]], and approximately corresponding to modern [[24 June]] through [[23 July]]. This month was called [[Mede]] in [[Bree]].

The [[Quenya]] name was [[Cermië]], and the [[Sindarin]] name - used by the [[Dúnedain]] - was [[Cerveth]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Afterlithe was named for its occurrence after the holiday of Lithe. (See [[Forelithe]]) The name corresponds to the Old English name for July, [[wiktionary:æfterra liþa|æftera Líða]], or "after Litha."
