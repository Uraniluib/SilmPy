The '''Hills of Evendim''', or '''Emyn Uial''' in [[Sindarin]], were a series of hills in northern [[Eriador]].

The hills began about a hundred [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles north of [[the Shire]] in northern Eriador. At the southern end was the city of [[Annúminas]], the first capital of [[Arnor]], at [[Lake Evendim]]. The [[Baranduin]] or Brandywine River flowed out of this lake. The river [[Lhûn]] also had a tributary beginning in the hills.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

==History==
After the end of the [[First Age]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] crossed the [[Ered Luin]] and settled in the Hills of Evendim.  In this location, sometime between {{SA|350}} and 400, their son [[Amroth]] was born.  However, after the year {{SA|700|n}} Galadriel and Celeborn left and established the realm of [[Eregion]].<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

When the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] first returned to Middle-earth, the Hills of Evendim were also populated by Men related to the ancestors of the [[Edain]]. The Númenóreans settled nearby, and the hills formed the core of the kingdom of Arnor.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>  After the establishments of the Kingdoms in Exile by [[Elendil]] and his sons, the Men of Evendim merged with the [[Dúnedain]], becoming the people of Arnor together with non-Edain Men like the Men of [[Bree]].

In {{TA|1974}} the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] conquered [[Arthedain]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  His victory was short-lived, however, for in {{TA|1975|n}} the forces of [[Círdan]] and [[Eärnur]] of [[Gondor]] descended from the Hills of Evendim and on the plain between [[Lake Evendim|Nenuial]] and the [[North Downs]] crushed the forces of Angmar.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
