'''Falathar''' was one of three faithful companions who accompanied [[Eärendil]] on his mighty sea-voyages. He was with his captain when the ship [[Vingilot]] made its epic journey into the distant [[Aman|West]], to reach the [[Blessed Realm]] itself. 

While [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] journeyed ashore, Falathar remained aboard the ship with his fellows [[Erellont]] and [[Aerandir]]. After Eärendil had delivered his embassy to the [[Valar]], their emissary [[Eönwë]] came to the three mariners and set them in another boat. The Valar sent a wind out of the west to blow Falathar and his companions back across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and, presumably, they landed again somewhere in [[Middle-earth]], though their ultimate fate is not recorded.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Falathar'' contains [[Sindarin]] ''[[falas]]'' ("shore, line of surf").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> The ending is not explained, but a relationship to ''[[thar-]]'' "across, over, beyond" is not inconceivable. 
==Theories==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never specified the race of the three mariners: while it has been suggested that they were [[Men]],<ref>[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/aerandir.html Aerandir] at [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.asp Encyclopedia of Arda] (accessed 6 April 2011)</ref> others argue that they were [[Elves]].<ref>[http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=347256&page=73 War of the Silmarils] (game forum thread; accessed 6 April 2011)</ref>
