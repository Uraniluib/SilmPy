According to the legend, it appeared as a crown above [[Durin]]'s reflection in [[Mirrormere]] despite the fact it was day; he saw it as a good omen and built [[Moria|Khazad-d√ªm]] in the valley of [[Azanulbizar]]. [[Durin's Stone]] was set to commemorate the location and the event. 

Ages later, in {{TA|3019}}, [[Gimli]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] looked in the lake, but whether they saw the crown is unclear<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>.

==Identity==
The form of the constellation is not known. It's possible that the seven stars on [[Doors of Durin]] around the crown signify the constellation. [[Valacirca]] is also a constellation of seven stars. 

Steve Gardner concluded that it could also have been [[Wikipedia:Auriga_(constellation)|Auriga]] or the [[Wikipedia:Corona_Borealis|Northern Crown]].<ref>''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' #13, p. 3</ref>

Since the constellation was a miraculous event, it's also possible that its stars were only a vision, and not an actual constellation set on [[menel]].
