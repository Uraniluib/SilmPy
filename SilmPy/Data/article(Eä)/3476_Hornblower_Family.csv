The '''Hornblower Family''' was an old and important family of [[the Shire]]'s [[Southfarthing]]. Its most famous member was [[Tobold Hornblower]] of [[Longbottom]], who introduced [[pipe-weed]] into the Shire, and his family remained associated with the industry.<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> Their [[Longbottom Leaf]] variety was famous, and indeed barrels of Leaf bearing the Hornblower mark were found as far afield as the ruins of [[Isengard]]. It should be noted that the hobbits considered their habit of smoking an art, and that Perigrin Took and Meridoc Brandybuck were very excited when they found the stash at [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

From Tobold's time, and perhaps earlier, the Hornblowers were one of the Shire's more important families. The importance of the family is also seen in the jewel-name of [[Amethyst Hornblower|Amethyst]], and her marriage into the [[Bolger Family]].<ref>{{App|Bolger}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]] himself had Hornblower blood â€” his great-grandfather [[Largo Baggins]] married one [[Tanta Hornblower]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 
==Etymology==
The meaning of this old family name is occupational; perhaps one of Tobold's ancestors, or himself, actually did blow a horn of some kind.<ref name="N">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref> Perhaps the name is a punning reference to pipe-smoking.
==Inspiration==
Hornblow and Hornblower are real-life English surnames.<ref name="N"/>
