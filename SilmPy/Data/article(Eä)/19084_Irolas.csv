}}'''Irolas''' was an officer on [[Minas Tirith]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. He is played by [[Ian Hughes]]. 

==History==
Irolas came down to the gate after [[Faramir]] had pulled out of [[Osgiliath]], and praised the wisdom of [[Denethor]]. Soon after, he saw that wisdom again in play as he had to bring the severely wounded Faramir to his lord. Dumbfounded, Irolas witnessed the total breakdown of Denethor as he ordered everyone to abandon their posts. 

==Etymology==
''Irolas'' is obviously an anagram of the [[canon]]ical name [[Iorlas]] (the same way the character [[Madril]] is derived from [[Mardil|Mardil VoronwÃ«]]). However, there is no actual background or etymology behind it.

==Inspiration==
In the commentary of {{rotkee}}, it is stated that he was originally to be called [[Beregond]], but as the role was reduced, [[Peter Jackson]] saw little use in still calling him Beregond. On the [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game|Decipher Card]], Irolas is identified as [[Imrahil]] instead.
