<center>{{quote|Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast. 'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!'|''[[The Two Towers]]'', [[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]]}}</center>
'''Erkenbrand''' was one of the [[Rohirrim]]. He was the Lord of the [[Westfold]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. He was the uncle of [[Dúnhere]]. 
==Life==
Erkenbrand was presumably born in the [[Hornburg]], and followed his father as the Lord of the Westfold. He became a valiant knight in the service of the [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]], but nothing is told of the deeds of those times. He retired, and settled in the Hornburg.

When the shadow from [[Isengard]] began to grow, Erkenbrand strengthened the defenses of the Hornburg and the [[Deeping Wall]]. After the death of [[Théodred]] on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}} in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], Erkenbrand took command of the western defenses of Rohan. He sent a messenger to [[Théoden]] in [[Edoras]] to inform him of the ill news and ask for reinforcements, but [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] delayed the message. 

[[Elfhelm]] eventually rode to the [[Fords of Isen]] with the men of Edoras, where they joined [[Grimbold|Grimbold of Grimslade]], who was left in charge of the Fords when Erkenbrand tried to send stragglers from the first battle to [[Helm's Deep]]. Erkenbrand had left around 1000 troopers under [[Gamling|Gamling the Old]] to guard his home. 

On [[2 March|March 2]], the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] was fought, and the defenses on the [[Isen]] were driven back by [[Saruman]]'s forces. Erkenbrand had managed to gather around a thousand soldiers when they came across [[Gandalf]]. Gandalf told them Théoden sought the refuge of the Hornburg, and that they would join the battle. They arrived at dawn of [[4 March|March 4]], and turned the tide of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].  

Erkenbrand did not come to [[Minas Tirith]] to fight in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]; instead, he stayed behind to guard Rohan. He was granted this command because of his age, experience and authority.<ref>{{UT|Isen}} , Appendix (ii)</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]], King [[Éomer]] named Erkenbrand [[Marshal of the West-mark]].

==Appearance==
Erkenbrand was said to have been tall and strong, and reminiscent of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. He bore a red shield and a black horn.

==Etymology==
Erkenbrand is a name that possibly was derived from two [[Old English]] words: ''eorcan'' (meaning "precious") and ''brand'' (meaning "fire-brand, torch; sword").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413</ref>
