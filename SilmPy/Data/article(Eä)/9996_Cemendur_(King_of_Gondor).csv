}}'''Cemendur''' ({{SA|3399}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|238}},<ref name="south">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 280 years) was the fourth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Cemendur ruled for 80 years, from {{TA|158}} until his death. He was the son and successor of Meneldil, the first ruler of [[Gondor]] to rule in his own name.<ref name="south"/>

Little is known about his reign, only that it was a peaceful one. He was succeeded by his son [[Eärendil (King of Gondor)|Eärendil]].

==Etymology==
''Cemendur'' is [[Quenya]] for "Earth-servant", from ''[[kemen]]'' and ''[[-ndur]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|dated=December 25, 2008|website=Arda}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]], perhaps incorrectly, translates the name as "Earth Lord".<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 67</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Section VII "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]", it was explained that three manuscripts existed in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the Southern Line of Gondor, and appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Kemendur was spelled with a 'K' and he lived from {{SA}} 3389 to {{TA}} 228 instead of {{SA|3399}} to {{TA|238}}.<ref name="Elendil"/>
