'''Lanthir Lamath''', the "Waterfall of Echoing Voices"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> was the shimmering, glittering waterfall that ran beside the house of [[Dior|Dior Eluch√≠l]] in [[Ossiriand]], probably part of the stream of the River [[Adurant]]. Lanthir Lamath was most famous for inspiring the name of Dior's daughter [[Elwing]], whose name - meaning '[[Star-spray]]' - was inspired by the falling water on the night of stars when she was born.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>
