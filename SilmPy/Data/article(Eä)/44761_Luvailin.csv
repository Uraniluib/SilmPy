__NOTOC__
'''Luvailin''' or '''Shadowmere''' was a mere in [[Eldamar]] under the shadow of [[Oiolossë]].<ref name=UI>{{HM|UI}}, p. 217</ref> 

Shadowmere is mentioned  in [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]]  [[Song of Eärendil]]<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> in [[Rivendell]]:
<poem>
''...where pale as glass
''beneath the Hill of [[Ilmarin]]
''a-glimmer in a valley sheer
''the lamplit towers of [[Tirion]]
''are mirrored on the Shadowmere.
</poem>
As the mere reflected the lights of the city of Tirion, "it must have lain in or near to" the valley of [[Calacirya]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/shadowmere.html|articlename=Shadowmere|dated=8 November 2008|website=EoA|accessed=22 November 2013}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Luvailin'' appears only in the ''[[Unfinished index]]''. The name ''Shadowmere'' is said to be its "translation".<ref name=UI/> Though Tolkien did not provide an explanation of the latter, [[Tolkien fandom|fans]] have speculated that ''Luvailin'' seems to contain the elements ''luv-'' *"shadow-" (seemingly from √LUM, LUB "shadow, darkness",<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 161, 168</ref>) and ''ailin'' "pool, lake"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} s.v. AY-, p. 349</ref>,<ref group=note>See also the root √LĬNĬ "pool, mere, lake" ({{PE|17}}, p. 77).</ref> and that it is unclear if the name is supposed to be [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?76445-Shadowmere-a-quot-translation-quot-of-Luvailin|articlename=Shadowmere, a "translation" of Luvailin|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=18 November 2013}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In an early version of [[Galadriel's Song of Eldamar]], appears the lines:
<poem>
''And by the strand of Tirion there grew a golden Tree.
''Beneath the stars of Ever eve in Eldamar it shone,
''In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. 
''But far away and far away beyond the '''Shadow-meres'''''
</poem>

A different version of the second line above was: ''Beneath the Hill of Ilmarin lies Aelinuial''.<ref group=note>The name ''[[Aelin-uial]]'' appears in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as a name for the Meres of Twilight in [[Beleriand]].</ref><ref>{{TI|XIV}}, pp. 284, 292 (note 35)</ref>
