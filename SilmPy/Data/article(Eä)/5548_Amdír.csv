}}'''Amdír''', also called '''Malgalad''',<ref name="AppB">{{UT|6b}}</ref> was a [[Sindar|Sindarin]] [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Beleriand]], who later became the King of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]].

==History==
After the [[War of Wrath]], Amdír came from [[Beleriand]] with his son [[Amroth]], and established himself in [[Lórinand]], where he would soon lead the princeless [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name="AaN">{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> 

Peace lasted, until the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and the subsequent return of [[Sauron]] to [[Middle-earth]]. Though he answered the call of [[Gil-galad]] to the [[War of the Last Alliance]], he did not serve under the [[High King of the Noldor]]. Instead, he led a small force of [[Galadhrim]] and joined forces with the greater army of [[Silvan Elves]] under King [[Oropher]], the ruler of [[Greenwood the Great]] who was also a Sinda.<ref name="AppB"/>

Ill-equipped compared to the [[Noldor]] and highly independent, the Silvan Elves suffered heavy losses in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. Oropher and Amdír, with half of his forces, were cut off from the main force and perished in the [[Dead Marshes]].<ref name="AppB"/>

==Etymology==
The word ''Amdir'', without the long ''í'', is recorded as a word for "Hope", or "looking up", in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{MR|P4c}}</ref> 
However, the name '''Amdír''' with a long ''i'' may rather possibly derive from a shortened form of Sindarin ''[[dîr]]'' (meaning an "adult male"), chiefly used as ending in proper names.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[DER]]</ref>

The King of Lórien is called '''Malgalad''' in one text, detailing the fate of the Sindarin kings in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]] argues that, since they are contemporaries and both described as Kings that died in the Battle of Dagorlad, they are likely the same.<ref name="AppB"/> It is unclear however which form was abandoned. ''Malgalad'' likely means "Gold-shine", from ''[[malt]]'', "gold (the metal)"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[SMAL]]</ref> and ''[[galad]]'', "light, radiance, glittering, reflection (from jewels, glass or polished metal, or water)"<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}} "The Names of Finwë's Descendants"</ref> or "Golden-tree", from the outdated spelling of ''[[galadh]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[GAL]]</ref>
