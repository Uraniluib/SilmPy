'''The White Council''', also referred to as the '''Council of the Wise''', was a group of the [[wise]] in [[Middle-earth]] which met irregularly. Its purpose was 'to unite and direct the forces of the [[Westlands|West]], in resistance to the [[Sauron|shadow]].'<ref name="PMThird">{{PM|Third}}</ref>

==History==
===The Second Age===
A "White Council" first met in c. {{SA|1701}}.<ref group="note">In {{UT|Concerning}} it states that 'At this time the first Council was held'. The 'At this time' follows on from the driving out of Sauron from [[Eregion]], which occurred {{SA|1701}} according to {{App|SA}}. According to {{UT|Concerning}}, n. 10 'the first Council' was emended to 'the first White Council'.</ref> At this meeting it was decided that [[Rivendell|Imladris]] should become the stronghold of the [[Elves]] in [[Eriador]], rather than [[Eregion]]. No members are mentioned explicitly, but it is implied that at least [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] were members because Gil-galad gave [[Vilya]] to Elrond 'At that time also'.<ref name="UTConcerning">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> It seems likely that the "White Council" of the [[Third Age]] echoed this "White Council" of the [[Second Age]].<ref name="UTConcerningNote10">{{UT|Concerning}}, n. 10</ref>

===The Third Age===
In {{TA|2063}}<ref name="AppBTA"/> [[Gandalf]] entered [[Dol Guldur]] and drove [[Sauron]] away, beginning the [[Watchful Peace]]; although this was before the formation of the Council, the feat was attributed to them.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, "...the Watchful Peace, during which Sauron withdrew before the power of the White Council..."</ref><ref group=note>The discrepancy is noted in {{HM|Guide}}, p. 424</ref>

In {{TA|2463}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> following the return of [[Sauron]] and the end of the [[Watchful Peace]] in {{TA|2460|n}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> [[Galadriel]] summoned the first meeting of the White Council.<ref name="FRMirror"/>

There are only four known meetings of the White Council:
#{{TA|2463}}<ref name="AppBTA"/>
#{{TA|2851}}<ref name="AppBTA"/>
#{{TA|2941}}<ref name="AppBTA"/>
#{{TA|2953}}<ref name="AppBTA"/>

At the first meeting in {{TA|2463}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> there were Saruman, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and Círdan, and other lords of the Eldar. It was mooted that [[Gandalf]] be the head of the Council, but to [[Galadriel]]'s dismay he refused the office as he preferred his independence. [[Saruman]] was chosen as their chief instead, because of his knowledge on Sauron's devices, and he begrudged Gandalf for being the desired candidate.<ref name="SRings"/>

At the second meeting in {{TA|2851}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> the Council met at [[Rivendell]].<ref name="UTGandalf">{{UT|Gandalf}}</ref> Gandalf urged an attack on [[Dol Guldur]] following his discovery in the [[Third Age 2850|previous year]] that its master was indeed [[Sauron]].<Ref name="SRings"/> Saruman overruled him because in secret he had begun to desire [[the One Ring]] for himself.<ref name="AppBTA"/> Saruman insisted that there was no reason to attack Sauron, claimng therefore that, the One Ring fell into the Anduin, and by now it had been flown to the [[Bay of Belfalas|Sea]].<ref group=note name=repetition>According to the ''Appendix B'', Saruman makes this claim during the last meeting, however according to the ''Rings of Power'', this argument is said in the second meeting.</ref> In reality Saruman wanted to win some time, knowing that the Ring would sooner or later reveal itself to return to its Master; moving against him, it would make the Ring to hid again.<Ref name="SRings"/> Unusually for a White Council meeting, Gandalf sat apart from the others, in silence and smoking, whilst Saruman spoke against the attack on Dol Guldur. This irritated Saruman and he spoke to Gandalf afterwards, asking him why he did not join in the discussion, and mocked his smoking. Gandalf replied, saying that [[pipe-weed]], a practice of the [[Hobbits|Halflings]], gave him 'patience'. Saruman mocked him again and in response Gandalf sent out many rings of smoke into the air and grasped them in his hand before they vanished. Saruman read this gesture as suggesting that Gandalf suspected him of wanting to possess the One Ring, or that there was a connection between the rings of power and the Halflings.<ref name="UTGandalf"/>

At the third meeting in {{TA|2941}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> Gandalf said that although the One Ring was lost, its existence alone allowed Sauron to live, who had now the [[Nine Rings]] and three of the [[Seven Rings|Seven]], and repeated his call to attack [[Dol Guldur]].<Ref name="SRings"/> Saruman finally submitted for he knew that Sauron was searching for the One Ring in the [[Anduin]]<ref name="AppBTA"/> and thrusting him from Dol Guldur would allow him to search freely.<Ref name="SRings"/> The White Council launched an [[attack on Dol Guldur]], but [[Sauron]], having already made plans, fled to [[Mordor]].<ref name="AppBTA"/><Ref name="SRings"/>

At the fourth and final meeting in {{TA|2953}}, following Sauron's open declaration in {{TA|2951|n}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> there was a discussion on the [[Rings of Power]]. Saruman claimed to have knowledge that the One Ring had been lost down the [[Anduin]] and into the [[Belegaer|Sea]]<ref group=note name=repetition/> this quieting Gandalf's worries about Bilbo's Ring. Afterwards, Saruman retreated to [[Isengard]] and isolated himself from the others<ref name="AppBTA"/><Ref name="SRings"/> and would be ensnared by Sauron in {{TA|3000|n}}.<ref name="AppBTA"/>

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Having arrived at [[Rivendell]] with [[Thorin and Company]], [[Gandalf]] met with [[Elrond]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Saruman]]. It seems that Gandalf was unaware that the meeting would take place. Whilst this meeting is not explicitly called the "White Council," its membership and discussion points have much in common with the White Council in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings. Much of the history of the [[Third Age]] is conflated and substantially altered. Gandalf told the Council that [[Radagast]] had found [[Dol Guldur]] occupied by a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Saruman was very sceptical of Radagast's story and dismissed Gandalf for believing him. Gandalf and Galadriel converse telepathically before the wizard showed the Council a [[Morgul-knife|morgul blade]] which belonged to the [[Witch-king]]; the blade and [[Nazgûl]] had been buried together many centuries previously following the downfall of [[Angmar]].

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''

:[[Gandalf]] has been imprisoned by [[Sauron]] after a failed solo mission to the stronghold. [[Galadriel]] arrives at the fortress to rescue him, vanquishing an [[Orcs|Orc]] in the process. She and Gandalf are then surrounded by the spectres of the [[Nazgûl|Nine]], but [[Elrond]] and [[Saruman]] arrive on the scene and attack them. Galadriel heals Gandalf, and he is swiftly taken to safety by [[Radagast]]. Sauron himself manifests before the council, but Galadriel assumes a dark ethereal form and overpowers him, with Sauron's spirit fleeing into [[Mordor|the East]].
