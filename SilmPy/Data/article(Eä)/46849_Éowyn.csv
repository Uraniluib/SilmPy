{{quote|Then, '''Éowyn of Rohan''', I say to you that you are beautiful. In the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair and bright, and maidens fairer still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor so lovely, and so sorrowful. It may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls upon our world, and when it comes I hope to face it steadily; but it would ease my heart, if while the Sun yet shines, I could see you still. For you and I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow, and the same hand drew us back.|[[Faramir]]<ref name="Steward">{{RK|VI5}}</ref>}}

''Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.''

'''- Éowyn - The Return of the King'''

'''Éowyn''' ({{TA|2995}} – [[Fourth Age]] ?), the '''Lady of Rohan''', was also known as the [[Lady of the Shield-arm]], the White Lady of Rohan<ref group="note">Éowyn was known as "Lady of Rohan" in Rohan, but as "White Lady of Rohan" in Ithilien (due to her pale complexion).</ref>, and Lady of Ithilien. She was a member of the [[House of Eorl]] and the niece of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]]. She was the daughter of Théoden's sister, [[Théodwyn]], and [[Éomund]] of Eastfold. Her brother was [[Éomer|Éomer Éadig]]. Following the end of the [[War of the Ring]], she and Faramir were married and bore one son, [[Elboron]]. <ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==History==
Following the death of her parents in {{TA|3002}}, Éowyn and Éomer were brought into Théoden's house and there raised. Éowyn grew to be tall and slender, with a grace and pride that came from her mother.<ref name="Mark"/>

Prior to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Éowyn was left to care for [[Meduseld]] when Théoden and Éomer led the remaining [[Rohirrim]] to the west. King Théoden in fact named her ruler of [[Rohan]] in his and Éomer's absence when the Doorward [[Háma]] recommended that one of "The House of Eorl" should rule. At first, Théoden only thought of male members, and he and Éomer were the last males of the House, but Háma reminded them of Éowyn, who "is fearless" and that "all love her".<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

Éowyn revealed her temperament when [[Aragorn]] was about to ride into the mountains to attempt to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Unable to dissuade him, she offered to accompany him, declaring herself "weary of skulking in the hills, and wish to face peril and battle." The only thing she feared was a cage. However, Aragorn reminded her of her charge to govern the people until the king's return and left without her.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

Later, when the forces of Rohan were mustered to go to Gondor, Éowyn disguised herself as a man, and under the alias of '''[[Dernhelm]]''', travelled with the Riders of Rohan, carrying with her [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who was also ordered to remain behind.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], she fought by King Théoden, and when he was injured during combat with the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]], she and Merry scrambled to help him. Confronting the Witch-king, who boasted that "no living man may hinder me," she removed her helmet, exposing her long golden hair and declaring:

<blockquote>''"No living man am I! You look upon a woman."''</blockquote>
[[File:Matt Stewart - Dernhelm.jpg|thumb|left|[[:Category:Images by Matt Stewart|Matt Stewart]] - ''Dernhelm'']]
Lady Éowyn slew the Witch-king after Merry stabbed him behind the knee. Merry's stab made the Witch-king vulnerable while Éowyn's slash actually resulted in death. She was granted the title "Lady of the Shield-arm" after the Battle in recognition of her triumph over the Witch-king.<ref name="Battle">{{RK|V6}}</ref>

Lady Éowyn was severely injured in this fight, and because of the poisonous effect of the Nazgûl, she faced near-certain death; however, she was treated in time by Aragorn during his brief rest in [[Minas Tirith]]. Since she didn't yet recover completely, she couldn't join Aragorn's army on their way to [[Mordor]]. However, while recuperating in the [[Houses of Healing]], she met [[Faramir]], with whom she fell in love.

After the demise of [[Sauron]], the happily wed couple settled in [[Ithilien]], of which Faramir was made the ruling Prince. Éowyn was known as the Lady of Ithilien.<ref name="Steward"/><ref group=note>This seems to imply that Éowyn was not a Princess, whereas her husband was a Prince</ref> They married,<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> and dwelt together in the hills of [[Emyn Arnen]] in [[Ithilien]].<ref name="Steward"/> They had at least one son (likely Elboron),<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> and their grandson was [[Barahir (grandson of Faramir)|Barahir]], who wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'' in the Fourth Age.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Éowyn'' means "Horse-joy" in [[Old English]] (being a combination of her parents' names: [[Éomund]] and [[Théodwyn]]),<ref name="Intro">{{HM|IE}}, "The Giving of Names", p. 216</ref> the language [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] adapted to represent [[Rohirric]].<ref name="L144">{{L|144}}</ref>

Éo- sounds like "eh-ah" with the "ah" just barely pronounced, while ''y'' is the same sound as German ''ü'' or French ''u''.
==Other names==
The "White Lady of Rohan" title given by [[Faramir]] to Éowyn of [[Rohan]] when they were together looking out from the walls of [[Minas Tirith]] and saw the huge cloud that rose above [[Mordor]] at the fall of [[Sauron]]<ref name="Steward"/> on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Analysis==
Just as MacDuff disconcerted [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Macbeth Macbeth] by revealing he was not "of woman born", Lady Éowyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old prophecy by [[Glorfindel]], fulfilling that the Witch-king would not be slain by a man. However, the Witch-king actually recited the prophecy incorrectly: he said that "no living man may hinder me," though the prophecy actually said that "not by the hand of ''man'' will he fall."<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Glorfindel's prophesy, unlike his own version, implies that the Witch-king will not fall to a man. In Tolkien's writing, man and woman applies simply to the gender of any Middle-earth race. Only when he capitalised Man did it denote the race of Men. The Witch-king may not have realised that the prophecy meant only a male, thus, his moment of doubt and hesitation when he faced Éowyn.<ref name="Battle"/>

'''1955-6: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Olive Gregg]] provides the voice of Éowyn.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Éowyn is briefly seen, but has no lines.

'''1979: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Mind's Eye's The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:Éowyn is portrayed by [[Karen Hurley]].

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Éowyn is voiced by actress [[Nellie Bellflower]]. She appears unintroduced, but Merry fills Pippin (and so the spectator) in on the details. She is not terribly wounded, and appears healthy beside Faramir at the coronation.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Elin Jenkins]] plays the part of Éowyn. She is introduced much earlier than in the book when Gandalf escapes from Isengard and borrows a horse from Theoden. Unlike some adaptations her recovery in the Houses of Healing, and the blossoming of her relationship with Faramir are included. She is last encountered in the penultimate episode gifting Merry the horn he would blow later during the scouring of the Shire.

'''2002-3: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Éowyn is portrayed by [[Miranda Otto]]. Jackson's adaptation shows two different explanations for Éowyn's injuries after fighting the Witch-king. In the Theatrical Release, her wounds are less severe than in the book; she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. In the extended scenes of the Extended Edition, she is near death: her brother finds her and grieves, and later we see her being healed in the Houses of Healing, where she shares a tender moment with Faramir.
