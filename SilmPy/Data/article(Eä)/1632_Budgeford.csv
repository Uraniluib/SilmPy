'''Budgeford''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] settlement in the [[Eastfarthing|eastern part]] of [[the Shire]], so close to the [[Brandywine Bridge]] that it fell in the district known as [[Bridgefields]]. It lay on the tributary of the [[Brandywine]] known simply as [[the Water]], north of [[Whitfurrows]]. The town of Budgeford was the seat of the [[Bolger Family|Bolgers]], an important family among the [[Shire-hobbits]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The 'ford' in its name apparently derives from a ford across this stream. On the [[A Part of the Shire|Shire Map]] the name is written '''Budge Ford''', perhaps denoting especially the ford.

''Budge-'' was an obscure [[Hobbitish]] element of no clear meaning in [[Westron]], believed to be connected to ''bulge'' and [[Bolgers]].<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 767</ref> Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested that the name represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Bolgraford'' "Ford of the Bolgers".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
