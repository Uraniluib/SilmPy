The '''Dark Land''', also referred to as the '''South Land''', was a continent that lay in south-east [[Arda]].<ref name=AmbarV>{{SM|A5}}</ref> 

==History==
The Dark Land was created as a by-product of the [[War for the Sake of the Elves]], in which the [[Valar]] overthrew [[Melkor]] in his original fortress of [[Utumno]].<ref name="SM293">{{SM|5b}}, pp. 293-294</ref><ref name="SM305">{{SM|5e}}, p. 305</ref> Originally, [[Middle-earth]] was one landmass, set between the western sea of [[Belegaer]] and the [[East Sea]].<ref>{{SM|A4}}</ref> This changed during the War; the inland [[Sea of Ringil]], originally set in the mid-south of Middle-earth, grew in size and "became a great sea flowing north-eastward and joining by straights both the Western and Eastern Seas."<ref name="SM293"/> This event split Middle-earth into two landmasses, and the landmass to the south and east of the former of Sea of Ringil<ref group=note>Confusingly, the former Sea of Ringil was also called the "East Sea" by Tolkien on one early map. See {{SM|A5}}.</ref> was known as the Dark Land.<ref name="SM305"/><ref name=AmbarV />

No inhabitants of the Dark Land were ever recorded. The Dark Land may have been part of the [[Empty Lands]] that [[Ilúvatar]] "cast back" during the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref name=LR>{{LR|P1II4}}, p. 32 ("If this region [the [[Empty Lands]]] ... is to be related to Ambarkanta Map V it must be what is there called the ''[[Burnt Land of the Sun]]''; perhaps also ''the Dark Land''[.]")</ref>

==Inspiration==
The Dark Land is named only in an early map by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]],<ref name=AmbarV /> likely dating to the mid-1930s.<ref>{{HM|LR}}, pp. 9, 108</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 42</ref>

[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have suggested and discussed different theories of inspiration behind the Dark Land:
*the Dark Land as reminiscent of [[Wikipedia:Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/35418 Message 35418] (dated 8 May 2009) at [[Elfling]] (accessed 20 October 2011)</ref>
*the Dark Land as perhaps representing a combination of both Australia and Antarctica (because of its geographic position).<ref>"[http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=212156 Dark Land...a continent south of Middle Earth?]" at [http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/default.asp The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza Forum] (accessed 20 October 2011)</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:Although never fleshed out in much detail, a "dark continent" called Mórenorë is said to be situated south of Middle-earth, separated by the sea of Haragaer.<ref>{{ICE|2003}}, pp. 7, 9</ref> A few glimpses of this remote continent, however, were provided: 
*A black cold-drake, Naikamil, fled from mountains in the south of Endor to Mórenorë after killing her mate.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}, p. 102</ref> 
*[[Ungoliant]], a monster of the Elder Days, is said to have "settled in the shadowy reaches of Morenórë, the Dark Continent",<ref group=note>Inspired by a passage in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which says that Ungoliant went "into the forgotten south of the world", after having dwelt at [[Nan Dungortheb]] (cf. "[[Of the Flight of the Noldor]]").</ref> according to tales of the Avari Elves.<ref>{{ICE|2006}}, p. 117</ref>
*Ninko Goldmaster, a mysterious merchant appearing as a character in an adventure setting, is rumoured to have visited distant lands, including Mórenorë.<ref>{{ICE|3112}}, p. 117</ref>

In his work ''[[Parma Endorion]]'', [[Michael Martinez]] coined the term ''Hyarmenor'' to refer to the Dark Land.<ref>{{webcite|author=Michael Martinez|articleurl=http://www.frodo.ru/library/tolkien/Essays_on_Middle-Earth.pdf|articlename=Parma Endorion|dated=2001|website=Frodu.ru|accessed=16 March 2018}}</ref>
