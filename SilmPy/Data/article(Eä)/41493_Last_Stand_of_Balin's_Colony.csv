The '''Last Stand of Balin's Colony''' was the final confrontation that took place between [[Balin's Colony]] of [[Dwarves]], and the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] in {{TA|2994}}.

==Prelude==
Four years after bringing a group of Dwarves from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to attempt to resettle the once Dwarf-city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], [[Balin]] was killed by an Orc arrow while peering into Lake [[Mirrormere]], and his people became immediately engaged with many Orcs coming of up the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]] River. After a continuous retreat from the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] and [[First Hall]], then the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] and [[Second Hall]], the remaining [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] were forced all the way back into the [[Twenty-first Hall]]. <ref name="Bridge"/>
After an unsuccessful attempt to escape through the [[Doors of Durin]] that saw the death of [[Óin]], the Chamber of Mazarbul became the last hold-out of the Colony after losing the Twenty-first Hall just outside chamber. Barring the gates, [[Ori]] and the few survivors set up a final defense.<ref name="Bridge"/>

==Opposing Forces==
Of the Dwarves there were very few. Four were all that returned of Óin’s group, and Ori is the only one who is known for sure. With so little information we can’t precisely know how many there were. However we do know that their remains were left at both sets of door in the Chamber of Mazarbul<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>,which considering the size of the area would mean no more than thirty or forty could have remained.

Of the Orcs we know that they were many.<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref> It is also a possibility that Trolls could have been present with the Orcs too as was seen over [[Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul|twenty years later]].<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

==The Battle==
As the Orcs were besieging the chamber, Ori wrote his final account of the Colony's history in the [[Book of Mazarbul]]. Soon after the Orcs breached the doors, and [[Ori]] and his kinsmen made their final stand at both entrances; eventually succumbing to the onslaught of Orcs, and their treasures plundered, and their bodies left desecrated.<ref name="Bridge"/>

==Aftermath==
With the Colony obliterated, no news or reports came to Erebor, and concern grew as the years past. After 24 years, King [[Dáin Ironfoot]] sent [[Glóin]], the brother of Óin, to [[Rivendell]] to see if Lord [[Elrond]] would have any information. <ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>
Glóin's son [[Gimli]] later went to Moria with the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and discovered the Chamber of Mazarbul, Book of the same name, and truth as to what happened to his kinsmen.<ref name="Bridge"/>
