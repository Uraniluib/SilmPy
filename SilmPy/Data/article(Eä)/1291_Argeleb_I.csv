'''Argeleb I''' ({{TA|1226}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1356|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 130) was the seventh king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Malvegil]], upon his death in 1349.

==History==
By the time Argeleb came to power, the line of kings had failed in the kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], so Argeleb claimed sovereignty over all of [[Arnor]]<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> (taking the royal prefix ''[[ar|ar(a)-]]'' as a token of this<ref>{{App|North}}, note 4</ref>).  He was thus not only the seventh King of [[Arthedain]], but also the seventeenth King of [[Arnor]]. Cardolan accepted this rule but Rhudaur resisted this claim, and a captain of the [[Hill-men]] of that land formed a secret alliance with Arnor's enemy, the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. In response, Argeleb fortified the [[Weather Hills|hills]], but he was killed during a siege in the Hills in {{TA|1356}}.<ref name="Eriador"/>

It was about this time that the remaining [[Stoors]] in the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]] left the area due to hostile nature of Rhudaur.  They either returned to  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] or went westwards like other [[hobbits]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

Argeleb ruled for only seven years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Arveleg I]], upon his death in {{TA|1356}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
Argeleb's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Silver King" from ''[[ar]]'' meaning "royal", and ''[[celeb]]'' (becoming [[lenition|lenited]] to ''geleb'') meaning "silver".
