'''Thangorodrim''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌθaŋɡoˈrodrim]}}) was a group of three volcanic mountains in the [[Iron Mountains]] in the north of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[First Age]]. The highest peaks in Middle-earth, they were raised by [[Morgoth]], who delved his fortress of [[Angband]] beneath them, and far back into the Iron Mountains.<ref name=LazyMorgan>{{HM|S}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Henning Janssen - Three Peaks Fortified.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henning Janssen]] - ''Three Peaks Fortified'']]
Thangorodrim was said to have been the piles of slag from Morgoth's furnaces and rubble from the delving of Angband, but at the same time they were solid enough to form sheer precipices; [[Maedhros]] was nailed to a cliff of Thangorodrim, and [[Húrin]] imprisoned on a high terrace. The tops of Thangorodrim perpetually smoked, and sometimes spewed forth lava. The three peaks of Thangorodrim functioned as furnaces for Morgoth's great smithies deep in Angband.

For a time the [[Eagles]] lived on Thangorodrim, but at some time during the First Age they removed to the [[Crissaegrim]] near [[Gondolin]].

At the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great [[Gates of Angband]], a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and forts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the sides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue forth and surprise their foes.

Along with [[Beleriand]] and the entire west of Middle-earth, Thangorodrim was destroyed in the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the First Age when the defeated dragon [[Ancalagon]] the Black fell on them.<ref name=LazyMorgan/>

==Position and size==

The position and size of Thangorodrim are unclear. One drawing by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], if to scale, would have made Thangorodrim 35,000 ft high, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles) north of [[Menegroth]] puts it too far away for some of the action in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have been more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien was not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf runs': the plateau of [[Dorthonion]] forced a long detour which added the extra 200, 250 miles to the distance.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (1991), ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''</ref>

==Etymology==

''Thangorodrim'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "Mountains of Tyranny"<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 116</ref> or "mountain-chain of tyranny".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 230 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref> The name consists of ''[[thang]]'' ("compulsion, oppression") + ''[[orodrim]]'' ("mountain-chain").<ref name=PE17/><ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 14 July 2011)</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:The "Remains of Thangorodrim" is an Under-deeps site (conceived as having been drowned in the ocean during the War of Wrath, but surviving as ruins). It cannot be reached from the surface, only through the adjacent site the Drowning-deeps.
