'''''adaneth''''' is [[Sindarin]] for a "mortal woman".<ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 349</ref>  Properly, this word refers only to those women who are descended from the [[Edain|Three Houses of Elf-friends]].

In the ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]'' King [[Finrod]] addresses [[Andreth]] as ''adaneth'', stressing the fact that she is a mortal, because their debate centers on "the gulf that divides our kindreds".<ref>{{MR|P4c}}, p. 323</ref>
