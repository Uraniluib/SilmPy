'''Nielthi''' was an [[Elf]]-maid of [[Melian|Gwendelin]] who was mentioned in an earlier stage of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s legendarium, in the tale of [[The Nauglafring]]. She was fleeing from [[Thingol|Tinwelint]]'s realm due to an attack by the [[Orcs]] and the [[Dwarves]]. At the same time, she tried to encourage Gwendelin by praising her magic that protected the realm.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, pp. 231-2</ref>
