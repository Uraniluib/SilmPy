The Woods of '''Núath''' was a wooded area in the north of [[Beleriand]].<ref group="note">Because the woods do not appear in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', they were left off the map of Beleriand. The name does appear in the map provided in ''[[The Children of Húrin]].</ref> It was bordered in the west by the hills lying north-west in [[West Beleriand]] south of the [[Ered Wethrin]], and in the east by [[Eithel Ivrin]], the source of [[Narog]]. The river [[Ginglith]] began in it.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, note 14</ref>

When [[Voronwë]] led [[Túor]] eastward to go to [[Gondolin]] they passed through the Woods of Núath. The journey was through bitter winds and took weeks to accomplish.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
