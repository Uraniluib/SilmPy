The '''Kin-strife''' was a disastrous civil war in [[Gondor]].
__NOTOC__
== History ==
=== Prelude ===
The unrest that created the Kin-strife began when [[Valacar]], the son of the Gondorian king [[Rómendacil II]], married a woman of the [[Northmen]] of  [[Rhovanion]], [[Vidumavi]]. She bore him a son [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], but many Gondorians of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood were angered by this mixing of blood of [[Middle Men]] and [[Númenóreans]], and the coastal provinces rebelled when Valacar grew old.

=== War ===
When in {{TA|1432}} Eldacar succeeded his father the unrest grew into open rebellion, as many Gondorians saw Eldacar as a halfbreed who had no right to rule. The chief of them was his distant relative  [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]], Lord of Ships, who in 1437 usurped the throne, forcing Eldacar into exile. During the rebellion [[Osgiliath]] was burned, and the great [[Dome of Stars]] was lost, together with its ''[[palantíri|palantír]]''. Castamir also murdered Eldacar's son and heir [[Ornendil]]. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in his stead.<ref name="Gondor"/>

A full decade later, in {{TA|1447|n}}, Eldacar returned with troops from Rhovanion, at the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel rule took place. Eldacar managed to kill Castamir at the [[Battle of the Crossings of Erui]], but Castamir's sons and many of their supporters fled south to the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]]. Eldacar could not follow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's control.<ref name="Gondor"/>

=== Aftermath ===
Not only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries and gained a new enemy in the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], descendants of Castamir's sons, but also many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed during the civil war, leaving Gondor weakened.

The Kin-strife was, along with the [[Great Plague]], one of the chief reasons for the abandonment of the fortresses in and surrounding [[Mordor]]. 

After the Kin-strife, the Kings of Gondor were generally cautious and watchful of those of near kin; the suspects often joined the rebels at Umbar, or renounced their heritage and took wives of non-Númenórean blood, further weakening the Númenórean strain of the [[House of Anárion]]. The repercussions were still felt centuries later, in the time of the last king [[Eärnur]], when very few descendants of the Kings were alive; when he was lost in [[Minas Morgul]], no suitable heir could be found to succeed him.<ref name="Gondor"/>
