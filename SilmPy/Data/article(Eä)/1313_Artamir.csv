}}'''Artamir''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "noble jewel", pron. {{IPA|[ˈartamir]}}, stem ''Artamír-''; died {{TA|1944}}) was the elder son and heir of King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]].<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
Prince Artamir was the son of the [[King of Gondor]], and elder brother of [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] and [[Fíriel]]. They were born during perilous years for Gondor. King Ondoher had been warned by [[Forthwini]] of [[Éothéod]] that the [[Wainriders]] were on the move. Indeed the realm was assaulted simultaneously from the East and the South.

In {{TA|1944}} Artamir and his father Ondoher were the two top leaders of the northern army of [[Gondor]] and led their forces into [[Ithilien]] in order to deploy upon the [[Dagorlad]], expecting the enemy from the north or north-east.  Unfortunately the enemy not only came quicker than expected, but also directly from the east along the outskirts of the [[Ered Lithui]]. The army of Gondor was strung out when the vanguard was struck by a powerful force of mixed cavalry and chariot-borne warriors.  The King, Artamir, and most of the King's Guard were annihilated in the attack.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>
==Aftermath==
Artamir was the eldest son and heir of Ondoher, and with his death, the line of succession should move to close male relatives of the [[House of Anárion]]. However his younger brother Faramir was also slain (he secretly disguised himself to participate in the battle) as well as the King's sister-son, [[Minohtar]] and the throne of Gondor remained vacant.

His sister Fíriel was married to [[Arvedui]], son and heir of the northern King of [[Arthedain]], and partly based on his marriage, he asked to be granted the throne.  However, the  Steward [[Pelendur]] and the [[Council of Gondor]] selected general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], who had crushed the enemies in the [[Battle of the Camp]] and saved the realm, to be the next king.<ref name="Gondor"/>
