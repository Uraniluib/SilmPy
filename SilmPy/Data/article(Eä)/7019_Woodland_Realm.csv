The '''Woodland Realm''' was a kingdom of [[Silvan Elves]] in [[Mirkwood]], from the [[Second Age]] onwards.

== History ==
=== Second Age ===
The Woodland Realm was established by [[Oropher]] in {{SA|750}}, a [[Sindar|Sindarin]] lord of [[Doriath]], after the [[War of Wrath]].<ref>{{PM|Second}}, p. 174</ref> Unlike most Sindar, Oropher and his household declined the [[Valar]]'s offer to depart from [[Middle-earth]] for [[Valinor]]. Instead he migrated eastward and became the King of the [[Nandor]] of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. The few Sindar who had come with him were soon merged with the [[Silvan Elves]], adopting their customs and language and taking names of Silvan form and style.<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/> Oropher and his household wished to return to a simple existence natural to the Elves before they had been disturbed by the Valar.<ref name="Sindarin Princes">{{UT|Galadriel}}, "Appendix B: The Sindarin Princes of the Silvan Elves"</ref>

Originally Oropher's realm encompassed the entirety of Greenwood, with its capital at [[Amon Lanc]]. However, during the Second Age, he and his people migrated north three times.<ref name="Note 14">{{UT|Gladden}}, note 14</ref> According to one tradition, the first movement was northward beyond the [[Gladden Fields]], due to Oropher's desire to distance himself from the increasing encroachments of the Dwarves of [[Moria]] and his resentment of the intrusions of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]]. However his people did maintain constant intercourse with their kin west of the [[Anduin]].<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/> Oropher was also disturbed by the reports of [[Sauron]]'s rising power and by the end of the Second Age he dwelt in the western glens of the [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Emyn Duir]] or Dark Mountains and his people lived north of the [[Men-i-Naugrim]] or Dwarf-road.<ref name="Note 14"/>

In {{SA|3430}},<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> Oropher and Amdír led their combined forces against [[Sauron]] as part of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. During the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] the Silvan contingent refused to obey the orders of the [[Noldor]]in king [[Gil-galad]], instead charging the enemy alone. They fought valiantly, but being ill-equipped and outnumbered most were slain, among them Oropher.<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/> Over the course of the war, which ended with the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|3441}}, most of the Silvan army had been lost. Thranduil led the remaining third of his army back home to the Greenwood.<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/>

=== Third Age ===
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Thranduil.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anke Eißmann]] - ''Thranduil''|right]]
Oropher's son, [[Thranduil]], succeeded him as king of the Woodland Realm<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/> and ruled for the duration of the [[Third Age]].

Around {{TA|1050}} an evil entity known as the [[Necromancer#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] (later identified as [[Sauron]]) inhabited the abandoned halls of [[Amon Lanc]], and Greenwood grew infested with [[Orcs]] and giant [[Spiders]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> The Wood-elves retreated yet further north<ref name="Sindarin Princes"/> and many landmarks were renamed: Greenwood became [[Mirkwood]], the Emyn Duir the Mountains of Mirkwood or ''[[Emyn-nu-Fuin]]'', and Amon Lanc was known as [[Dol Guldur]], the Hill of Sorcery.

By the middle of the Third Age, the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were much reduced in number though Mirkwood still had a greater population of Elves than Lindon, Rivendell, or Lothlórien.<ref>{{L|347}} p. 425 </ref> To avoid the encroachment of the Necromancer from the south, they dwelt in the lands north of the [[Forest River]], living mainly in and around the [[Elvenking's Halls]]. They also had become increasingly withdrawn and wary of strangers, though they did trade with the neighbouring realms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and [[Dale]], and imported wine from [[Dorwinion]] via the [[River Running]]. The former traffic came to an end upon with the destruction of Erebor by the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2770}}.<ref name="TA"/>

==== Quest for Erebor ====
In {{TA|2941}},<ref name="TA"/> Thranduil's people were disturbed, three times, by a band of [[Dwarves]] while feasting in the forest. The Dwarves were captured after the third interruption and brought to the Elvenking's halls. Though they had trespassed, they were not imprisoned until after they had been questioned and refused to be forthright. Their leader, [[Thorin]], refused to reveal the purpose of their journey from their halls far to the west in [[Eriador]].<ref name=Flies/> The others, taken separately, had been questioned, refused to speak openly, and also spoke insultingly of the Elves.<ref name=Barrels/> 

Thranduil was content to wait for the Dwarves' stubborness to subside. Though prisoners in the king's dungeons, they were not ill-treated by the Wood-elves who "were reasonably well-behaved even to their worst enemies, when they captured them."<ref name=Flies>{{H|Flies}}</ref> After many days of imprisonment, they escaped with the help of their companion, the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who had avoided capture using a [[The One Ring|magic ring]].<ref name=Barrels>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

Sometime later, the Elves heard that Smaug, provoked by the escaped dwarves, had left Erebor to attack [[Lake-town]] where he was slain by [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]]. With that news, it was believed that the dwarves must have died and the wealth of [[Thror]], augmented by Smaug's pillage of Dale, was left unprotected. Thranduil immediately assembled an army and marched towards [[Erebor]]. On the way, they met messengers from [[Bard]] seeking aid for the people of destroyed Lake-town. Thranduil being "the lord of a good and kindly people," turned his march to lend them aid.<ref name=Fire/> He gave them a great store of goods and skilled Elves stayed to help the people erect shelters for the winter. He and Bard, a descendant of [[Girion]] of Dale, then joined forces and marched north in arms as Thranduil had perceived that the swift spreading news of Smaug's death was "an ill wind . . . that blows no one any good."<ref name=Fire>{{H|Fire}}</ref> 

[[File:Capucine Mazille - The Battle of Five Armies.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Capucine Mazille]] - ''The Battle of Five Armies'']]
On arriving, however, they found Thorin and his company alive, and Thorin, despite their early attempts to negotiate, refused to relinquish his claim on any of the treasure and had secured Erebor against an assault. Thranduil and Bard then lay siege to the Dwarves, who awaited aid from their relatives in the [[Iron Hills]] to the east.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref> Hoping to avert battle, Bilbo delivered the [[Arkenstone]] to the Wood-elves and Men, so they could use it to bargain with Thorin.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref> This act earned him great respect from the Elvenking who stated that he was "worthy to wear the armour of elf-princes," which referred to the mithril-mail shirt, found in the dragon's hoard, that Thorin had given him. 

The next morning, Bard and Thranduil entered into negotiations with an angered Thorin, who agreed to pay one-fourteenth share of the treasure in exchange for the stone. Thranduil was reluctant to start a war over gold, but when the forces of Dáin arrived the next day, before the trade had been made for the Arkenstone, the Dwarves proceeded to attack. While the Elves, Men, and Dwarves skirmished, other enemies, who had learned of the dragon's fall, arrived. Orcs and [[Wargs]] from the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] had joined forces to march to the Lonely Mountain and sieze the hoard. Under the council of Gandalf, Elves, Men, and Dwarves joined together against their common foes. In the ensuing [[Battle of Five Armies]], many Wood-elves were slain, <ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> as was Thorin Oakenshield, but afterwards an agreement was reached for the division of the dragon hoard.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

In the same year, the [[White Council]], including [[Gandalf]], drove the Necromancer from Dol Guldur.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>

==== War of the Ring ====
[[File:Michael Kaluta - Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Kaluta]] - ''Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel''|left]]
Sauron, now revealed as the evil presence which had abandoned (not, as it had been thought at the time, driven out of) Dol Guldur, from his rebuilt stronghold in [[Mordor]] sent three [[Nazgûl]] to reoccupy Dol Guldur in {{TA|2951|n}}.<ref name="TA"/> On [[20 June]] {{TA|3018|n}} a force of [[Orcs]] attacked the Woodland Realm from this base, the purpose of this raid being to provide a distraction and facilitate the escape of [[Gollum]]<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> who had been entrusted to Thranduil's care by the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] [[Aragorn]].

In the wake of this Thranduil sent his son, [[Legolas|Legolas Greenleaf]], to deliver news of Gollum's escape to Aragorn and [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. Upon arriving Legolas participated in the [[Council of Elrond]] where the full details of Sauron's resurgence were revealed. <ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Legolas was chosen to represent the Elves in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], and journeyed with the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] [[Frodo Baggins]] towards Mordor. After the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]] Legolas continued to accompany Aragorn, fighting in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and the [[Battle of the Morannon]]. Legolas also developed a close friendship with the dwarf [[Gimli]], son of one of Thorin's companions: [[Glóin]]. This friendship did much to improve relations between the two peoples.

Meanwhile, on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}} Sauron attacked the Woodland Realm in force, resulting in the bloody [[Battle Under Trees]]. Thranduil led his forces to victory, however, and then set about a campaign to clear Mirkwood of orcs and other evil beings. On [[Elven New Year]] he met [[Celeborn]], lord of [[Lothlórien]], and the two agreed to rename the forest [[Eryn Lasgalen]]. It was then divided: Thranduil was to rule north of the mountains, the forest south of the [[Narrows of the Forest|Narrows]] became [[East Lórien]] and the rest was given to the [[Beornings]].

=== Fourth Age ===
During the Fourth Age the Woodland Realm prospered, free of enemies. A group of Wood-elves led by Legolas helped rebuild [[Minas Tirith]] and settled for a time in [[Ithilien]].

The eventual fate of the Woodland Realm is unknown. In {{FoA|120}} Legolas, having seen the sea during the War of the Ring, eventually sailed west to Valinor, reputedly with Gimli at his side.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> Like all Elves the people of the Woodland Realm were destined to either leave [[Middle-earth]] for Valinor or to 'fade' and become rustic woodland spirits. Given Oropher's refusal to leave Middle-earth at the end of the [[First Age]] was rooted in a desire to 'live naturally' as Elves had before being contacted by the Valar, it seems likely that the latter was the fate of Thranduil and most of his people. However, the ultimate fate of the last Elvenking and the remaining Elves in the [[Fourth Age]] is unknown.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Thranduil's realm is called [[Eryn Lasgalen]] and is accessible after the fall of Dol Guldur. In addition to "Felegoth", the Halls of the Elvenking, there is the [[Raft-elves|Raft-elf]] settlement of "Loeglond" near the [[Long Lake]]; and the haunted ruins of "Caras Tilion", the former capital in the Mountains of Mirkwood. The quests in the area involve bringing stability to the realm so that trade may resume.
