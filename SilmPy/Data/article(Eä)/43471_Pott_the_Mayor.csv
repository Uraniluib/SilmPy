Old '''Pott''' was, according to [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s poem "[[Perry-the-Winkle]]", a [[Mayor of Michel Delving]]. He witnessed the meeting of [[Mrs. Bunce]] with the [[Lonely Troll]] and he was in turn frightened. When he learned that the Troll was kind and generous, he and other [[Hobbits]] tried to visit him. But the Troll refused those who had refused his friendship.

It is unknown if this character was based on an actual person, or just an invention by the poet.<ref>{{AB|Perry}}</ref>
