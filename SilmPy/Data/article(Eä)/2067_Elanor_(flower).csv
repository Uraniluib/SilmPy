'''''Elanor''''' was a golden, star-shaped flower that grew in abundance in the forest of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]].<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> [[Samwise Gamgee]] thought highly of the flower and, at [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo's]] suggestion, named his eldest daughter, [[Elanor Gardner]], from it.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

It was like "a pimpernel (perhaps a little enlarged) growing sun-golden flowers and star-silver ones on the same plant, and sometimes the two combined".<ref>{{L|312}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The word ''elanor'' means "Sun-star" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[êl]]'' = "star" and ''anor'' = "[[Sun]]").
