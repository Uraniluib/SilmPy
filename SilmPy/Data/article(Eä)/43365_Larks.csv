==History==
After [[Finwë]]'s first wife [[Míriel]] died he lived in grief for many years.  [[Ingwë]], wishing to lighten his heart, invited him to leave [[Túna]] and come visit him where the light of the [[Two Trees]] might bring him healing.  As he approached the house of Ingwë on the west slopes of [[Oiolossë]], Ingwë's daughter [[Indis]] saw Finwë and sang a song of joy to him, which was "as a song of the ''lirulin'' in the sky."  Seeing Indis at this moment caused Finwë to fall in love with her and a year later the two were wed.<ref name="Finwe"/>
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
