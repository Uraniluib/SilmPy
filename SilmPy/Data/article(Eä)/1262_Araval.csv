'''Araval''' ({{TA|1711}} - {{TA|1891|n}},<ref name=North>{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 180) was thirteenth king of [[Arthedain]], coming to the throne in 1813 after the death of his father, [[Arveleg II]].<ref name=Elendil>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 195, 209-210</ref>

==History==
When Araval came to the throne Arthedain had been at war with [[Angmar]] for 400 years, and the [[Dúnedain]] had achieved very little in preventing the power of this old enemy from spreading. 

Araval, in coalition with the [[Elves]] of [[Lindon]] and [[Rivendell]], went to battle with the forces of Angmar in {{TA|1851}} and returned victorious. After this victory, Araval attempted to re-occupy [[Cardolan]], but the "evil [[wights]]" (likely referring to the [[Barrow-wights]]) terrified anyone who attempted to dwell there.<ref name=Elendil/>

Unfortunately, Araval's victory was of no avail in the long term: under [[Araphant]], Araval's son, Angmar recovered and continued its attacks on Arnor; and under [[Arvedui]], Araval's grandson, Angmar finally defeated Arthedain, laying Arnor to waste and scattering the remnants of the Dúnedain.

Araval ruled Arthedain for seventy-eight years, and was succeeded by his son [[Araphant]] upon his death in 1891.<ref name=Elendil/><ref name=North/>

== Etymology ==
There are two suggested etymologies for Araval's name:
#[[Sindarin]] for "Lord of Power" from ''[[Ara|ara-]]'' meaning "royal, king", and ''[[balan|bal]]'' meaning "power".<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]''</ref>
#Sindarin for "Golden King"<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 72</ref> or "King of Gold"<ref>[[David Salo]], [[Elfling]] message [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/30680 30680 (20 November 2004)] and [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/30687 30687 (20 November 2004)]; the guess is supported by noting the similarity with ''[[Argeleb (disambiguation)|Argeleb]]'', "Lord of Silver"</ref> from ''[[Ara|ara-]]'' meaning "royal, king", and ''mal'' meaning "gold".

In both cases, ''b'' and ''m'' are [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''v''.

Considering his [[#Other versions of the legendarium|earlier name]] ''Arvallen'' (''[[mallen]]'', "golden"), the second interpretation is more likely.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==

In another manuscript, Araval is said to have driven the evil wights north. An early name for Araval was ''Arvallen''.<ref name=Elendil/>
