'''Moles''' were small black animals, apparently well-known to the people of [[Gondolin]]. [[Maeglin]] adopted it as the symbol of the [[House of the Mole]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>

==Names==

As the word ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mole mole]'' has several meanings in English, it can be difficult to know if an Elvish word refers to the animal. In any case, some names are given:  [[Qenya]] ''noldare'', ''nolpa'' ("a mole"); [[Gnomish]] ''dolfa'', ''dolmeg'' ("a mole"), and ''meg'' ("any small animal, especially mole").<ref name=PE11>{{PE|11}}, pp. 30, 57</ref>
