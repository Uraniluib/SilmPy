'''Boldog''' was the name of an [[Orcs|Orc]] chieftain during the [[First Age]] as well as likely a title for [[Maiar]] who took Orc-shape. 

== History ==
[[Morgoth]], hearing of the beauty of [[Lúthien]] and pondering the purposes of [[Thingol]], sent a great force against [[Doriath]], led by Boldog; but with another purpose also - for Morgoth wanted to take Lúthien into [[Angband]], for reasons undisclosed. However, the [[Iathrim]] defeated the invading army and<ref>{{LB|C12}}</ref> Thingol himself slew Boldog.<ref>{{LB|3U}}</ref>

Some time later, when [[Finrod]], [[Beren]], [[Edrahil]] and their companions (clad in Orc-form) were brought before [[Sauron]], they said that they were a part of the army under the command of Boldog, and had urgent news to deliver to [[Thangorodrim]] - but Sauron saw through their disguise, revealing to them that Boldog was slain but lately, and also due to Beren's dismay and anger due to Sauron's mention of Lúthien and how Morgoth coveted her.<ref>{{LB|C7}}</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In [[Tolkien]]'s later works, he proposed that the name "Boldog" was not merely the name of an individual, but rather a title borne by Orc-shaped [[Maiar]]:
<blockquote>''Some of these things may have been delusions and phantoms but some were no doubt shapes taken by the servants of [[Morgoth|Melkor]], mocking and degrading the very forms of the children. For Melkor had in his service great numbers of [[Maiar]], who had the power, as their Master, of taking visible and tangible shape in [[Arda]]. '' ('Morgoth's Ring', "Myths transformed", text X')</blockquote>
<blockquote>''Boldog (&#8230;) is a name that occurs many times in the tales of [[Battles of Beleriand|the War]]. But it is possible that Boldog was not a personal name, and either a title, or else the name of a kind of creature: the '''Orc-formed Maiar''', only less formidable than the [[Balrogs]]'' (Author's footnote to the text X)</blockquote>
<blockquote>''Melkor had corrupted many spirits &mdash; some great as [[Sauron]], or less as Balrogs. The least could have been primitive Orcs.'' (Author's note to text)<ref>{{MR|P5}}</ref></blockquote>
