The '''Hair of Galadriel''' was described as golden touched with silver and seemed to shine with the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]. [[Fëanor]] requested a strand of [[Galadriel]]'s hair three times, but she refused each time. [[Gimli]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] was asked which [[Gifts of Galadriel|gift]] he would like prior to leaving [[Lothlórien]], and he responded:
{{quote|'There is nothing, Lady Galadriel', said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. 'Nothing, unless it might be - unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire'.|[[Gimli]], ''[[Farewell to Lórien]]''}}

Galadriel's response surprised all of the [[Elves]], she granted Gimli's wish and gave him three golden strands of her hair, which were later set in crystal as a "pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days."<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>
