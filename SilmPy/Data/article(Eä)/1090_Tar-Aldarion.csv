<center>{{quote|Aldarion, for so he is called in all tales, grew swiftly to a man of great stature, strong and vigorous in mind and body, golden-haired as his mother, ready to mirth and generous, but prouder than his father and ever more bent on his own will.|''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', [[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife]]}}</center>
'''Tar-Aldarion''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌtaralˈdari.on]}}, stem ''Aldariond-'') was the sixth King of [[Númenor]],<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Aldarion</ref> whose major accomplishments were his expansion of Númenor's maritime traditions and his [[Middle-earth]] explorations.  He was married to [[Erendis]], a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] woman of lesser status than Aldarion himself, and therefore she had a shorter life-span.  Aldarion's love for the sea ultimately caused a rift between the couple. The tale of their marriage and estrangement survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]] as "Aldarion and Erendis" or "The Mariner's Wife".<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

==The Great Mariner==
His first love was the sea, and he was already a great explorer before he became king, leading his crew in long voyages to Middle-earth, mostly against the wishes of his family. Aldarion created the [[Guild of Venturers]], whose quarters were on the ship [[Eämbar]]. He made several journeys to Middle-earth and established a friendship with [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]].<ref name="Wife"/> A visionary man, he saw the threat coming from [[Sauron]] upon the races of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] alike, so he built a vital Númenórean port in Middle-earth, at the mouth of the river [[Gwathló]]. It was named [[Vinyalondë]] and parts of it survived into the [[Third Age]] as the port of [[Lond Daer]].<ref name="Lond Daer">{{UT|6d}}</ref>

At his command, numerous ships were built, among which 3 were mentioned more often:

* [[Eämbar]], the "Sea-Home", headquarters for the Guild of Venturers
* [[Palarran]], the "Far Wanderer", which served him in many voyages
* [[Hirilondë]], the "Haven-finder", largest in Númenor

However, the first ship he had sailed on belonged to [[Vëantur]] and was called [[Númerrámar]], the "West-wings".<ref name="Wife"/> 

Around that time, the [[Drúedain]] who were living in Númenor became uneasy when Tar-Aldarion started his great travels and urged him not to go, foreseeing the mischief to come. They did not succeed and one after another they took ships towards Middle-earth.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> Indeed under his reign the deforesting of [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] began.<ref name="Lond Daer"/>

==Aldarion and Erendis==
Even before they were wed, Aldarion's love for the sea would prove to be Erendis' rival. In their conversations it is often stated that, for Erendis' part, Lady [[Uinen]] was her foe, while Aldarion's was the Vala [[Oromë]], referring to his wife's love for the forests and all growing things on the Island of Númenor. Such opposing characters led to the breaking of their marriage, one important factor in their separation being Aldarion's voyages, which kept him away from home for long years. Though in the end, as it is revealed in the [[Gil-galad's letter|letter sent by Gil-galad]] and read by King Meneldur, Aldarion was right to pursue his explorations, Erendis could not be convinced to renounce her pride and reconcile with him.<ref name="Wife"/>

==Succession==
His only child was a daughter, [[Tar-Ancalimë]], so he changed the [[Law of Succession in Númenor|Law of Succession]], replacing the principle of agnatic primogeniture with that of absolute cognatic primogeniture and she became the first ruling [[Queen of Númenor]].<ref name="Wife"/>

==Etymology==
Tar-Aldarion's royal name signifies "Son of the trees" (''[[alda]]'' + ''[[-ion]]'') because he was a noted tree steward and forester — trees were essential to the construction of his fleets, but he took great care to replenish what was being felled.
