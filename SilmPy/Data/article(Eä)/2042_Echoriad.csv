The '''Echoriath''' or '''Echoriad''', the '''Encircling Mountains''',<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> were a mountain range in the north of [[Beleriand]]. 

They were part of the highlands around [[Dorthonion]], with the [[Pass of Sirion]] separating them from the [[Ered Wethrin]] to the west; and the Pass of [[Anach]] separating them from the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] to the east. The southern part of the circle of mountains were called the [[Crissaegrim]], which was the abode of eagles.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

The Echoriath formed a natural circle of rock, enclosing the valley later called [[Tumladen]], within which lay the [[Elves|Elven]] city of [[Gondolin]]. A hidden ravine provided the main access through the Echoriath &mdash; a way guarded by seven gates.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
==History==
[[Maeglin]] prospected in the northern part of the Echoriad and found diverse and abundant metals.  From his mine, [[Anghabar]], he found hard iron that he prized.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

When [[Fingolfin]] died the eagle [[Thorondor]] carried his body to a mountain top north of Gondolin.  [[Turgon]], the son of Fingolfin, came and built a [[Fingolfin's Cairn|cairn]] over his body that no [[Orcs|Orc]] dared to approach.  Also in the aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]] [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] were the first men to enter Gondolin, but they did not traverse the hidden ravine to reach the city - instead they were borne aloft by the eagles of Thorondor over the Encircling Mountains.  Later they departed in the same manner and thus could not reveal the passage into Tumladen (and swore oaths to not reveal the valley's location).<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Yet it was Húrin who, despite his oath, eventually and inadvertently revealed the location of Turgon's realm to [[Morgoth]].  Húrin came to the Encircling Mountains and, lost, cried out for Turgon to hear him in his hidden halls.  Húrin was unaware that spies of Morgoth heard his words and reported to their master that the Hidden Kingdom must be located somewhere in this region.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

Then, after Maeglin was captured and revealed the precise location of the city, the host of Morgoth came to Gondolin, pouring over the Echoriad from the north and north east.  All would have died within the city but that [[Idril]] had made a secret tunnel.  She and [[Tuor]] led the remnants of the people of Gondolin out by this route and then they climbed into the mountains to the north, by the perilous pass known as the [[Cirith Thoronath]].  The refugees were attacked by [[Orcs]] and a [[Balrogs|Balrog]].  While eagles dispersed the Orcs, [[Glorfindel]] fought with the Balrog upon a pinnacle of rock and both fell into the nearby abyss.  Like Fingolfin, Thorondor came and brought Glorfindel's body up to the refugees, who buried him in a mound of stones beside the path.  The people then proceeded with their escape, and eventually came out of the mountains and into the vale of [[Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Echoriath is [[Sindarin]]. It means "encircling fence", from ''[[echor]]'' "encircling" and ''[[iâth]]'' "fence".<ref name="Elements">{{S|Elements}}, entries ''echor'' and ''iâth''</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] mentioned that his father's intent was to rename the Echoriath as ''Echoriad'', but perhaps this knowledge eluded him while publishing ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name="WJ">{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 27</ref>

In his [[Unfinished index]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gave an alternate name for the Encircling Mountains: '''Eryd Echor''', using the plural ''eryd'' of the Sindarin word ''[[orod]]'' "mountain".<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 62.</ref>
