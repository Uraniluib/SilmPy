The '''House of Anárion''' was the extended house of the nobles and royalty of [[Gondor]], descended from its first [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]]. The house included the Kings of Gondor and their heirs, of course, but also their siblings and their descendants. On several occasions, the direct line of descent failed in Gondor, and other members of the house were called on to take up the Kingship. Most notable among these was [[Meneldil]] himself, the first King to rule Gondor in his own right, who took up the throne on the death of his uncle [[Isildur]].

There are examples of members of the [[Royal House]] being granted important military roles. For example, the great [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] was a member of the Royal House, being a descendant of [[Telumehtar]], great-grandfather to the reigning King [[Ondoher]]. Indeed, when Ondoher and his heirs were lost, [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] eventually succeeded to the Kingship himself.

One important political role, however, was closed to members of the Royal House: that of Steward. When [[Rómendacil I]] created the Stewardship, he specified that no member of the House should ever take the role. The descendants of the [[House of Húrin]], who would eventually take on the hereditary Stewardship of the realm, were noted as being of high [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood, but they were not members of the Royal House itself.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

When [[Denethor|Denethor II]] was about to immolate himself upon a pyre, he proudly told [[Gandalf]] that he was a "Steward of the House of Anárion".  By using this name for the head of the royal house of Gondor he was rejecting [[Aragorn]] as a new king, calling the line of [[Isildur]] a "ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity".<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

Showing the descendants of Anárion.  All information in the tree is from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Appendix A, "The Southern Line Heirs of Anárion", <ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> or "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"<ref name="Gondor"/>, or  ''[[The Peoples of Middle-Earth]]'', The Heirs of Elendil<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> unless otherwise specified.  The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded (when only one figure is shown it is marked as either the date of birth, 'b.', or the date of death, 'd.').  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name preceded by '*' indicates one of the Kings of Gondor.  A vertical dashed line indicates a line of descent with some members missing.

===The Beginnings of the Royal House of Gondor===
Near the end of the [[Second Age]] the High King of the exiled [[Númenóreans]] was [[Elendil]], whose sons [[Isildur]] and Anárion jointly ruled the realm of Gondor.  Elendil and Anárion died in the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and Isildur died soon thereafter in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], which left the crown of Gondor in the hands of Anárion’s son Meneldil.  From this first sole King of Gondor came the House of Anárion, the royal house of Gondor.

===The Ship-Kings and the Noontide of Gondor===
After King Siriondil came the four [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor who extended the realm along the coasts and conquered the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]].  Atanatar II, the ruler who followed these kings, enjoyed the splendor of Gondor at the height of its power.

===The Era of the Kin-strife===
After Atanatar II the attention of Gondor shifted to the north and east.  Concerned about the loyalties of the [[Northmen]] and dismayed by the [[Easterlings]], Minalcar led an army to the east to remove the Easterling threat.  His son Valacar served as an ambassador to Vidugavia and unexpectedly wed his daughter.  From this union developed the [[Kin-strife]], the first great evil to befall Gondor.

===The End of the House of Anárion===
The second great evil to befall Gondor was the [[Great Plague]].  The realm had not yet recovered when the third evil struck, renewed attacks from the East in the form of the [[Wainriders]].  These people nearly killed off the line of kings, and weakened the line so that the [[Witch-king]] could deliver the final blow.  After the death of King Eärnur the rule of Gondor would fall upon the [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards]] of the [[House of Húrin]].
