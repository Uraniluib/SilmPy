'''Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búb-hosh skai''' is a phrase in [[Black Speech]], spoken by an unidentified [[Orcs|Uruk]] of [[Mordor]]. It was a phrase used to express a certain contempt in the handling of the prisoners [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], aimed at [[Uglúk]] and the Orcs of [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}</ref>

==Translation==
The phrase is not translated in the text, and in Appendix F it is only identified as "''the more debased form [of Black Speech] used by the soldiers of [[Barad-dûr|the Dark Tower]]''".<ref>{{App|Other}}</ref> However, there exist three different translations of this sentence.
===First translation===
This translation appeared in the draft of Appendix F, published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''. Here, it is translated as "''Uglúk to the cesspool, sha! the dungfilth; the great Saruman-fool, skai!''"<ref>{{PM|II}}, note 6</ref>
===Second translation===
In a second translation, published in an article by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] in [[Vinyar Tengwar 26|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 26]], the phrase reads "''Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob – búb-hosh skai!''", and the translation "''Uglúk to the dung-pit with stinking Saruman-filth - pig-guts, gah!''". Hostetter identifies the speaker as Grishnákh.<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], ''"Uglúk to the Dung-pit"'', in [[Vinyar Tengwar 26|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 26]], p. 16</ref>

===Third translation===
Yet another translation, published in [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 17]], is from the late 1950s, and as far as is known, Tolkien's last word on the subject. Here, the sentence is divided into one long sentence and one shorter - only expressing more contempt.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 78</ref> <br>
:"''[Ugluk] u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob.''<br>''búbhosh - skai!''"<br>
Which is translated as:<br>
:"''Uglúk to torture (chamber) with stinking Saruman-filth.''<br>''Dung-heap. Skai!''".
