'''Long Cleeve''' was a town in [[the Shire]].

==History==
Long Cleeve was the home of the [[North-took Family|North-tooks]], a distant branch of the [[Took Family]] who were descended from [[Bandobras Took|Bandobras]] the [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer]]. It was the home of [[Diamond of Long Cleeve|Diamond]], who married [[Peregrin Took]] eight years after his return from the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name "Cleeve" comes from the [[Old English]] word ''clif'', which means "cliff" or "hill".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lvii</ref>

This, and the name "North-Took" implies that it lay in [[Northfarthing]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Long Cleeve"</ref> much of which was rocky in nature (though none of this is stated specifically by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] himself).
