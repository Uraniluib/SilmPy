{{quote|The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight.|"[[The Great River]]", ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''}}

'''Nen Hithoel''' was a large lake upon the Great River [[Anduin]] amid the [[Emyn Muil]] to the east of [[Rohan]]. The lake was approximately 20 miles long from north to south, and 10 miles wide. The lake was formed by a narrow southern outlet and the small island of [[Tol Brandir]], which created a natural dam.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Upon the lake's northern approach from Anduin the [[Men]] of [[Gondor]] carved the huge pillars of the [[Argonath]] in the reign of [[Rómendacil II]] to mark the northern boundary of their realm,<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> although by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] that boundary has long since receded. At the southern end of the lake stood three steep hills. [[Amon Hen]], the "Hill of Seeing", was upon the western shore and [[Amon Lhaw]], the "Hill of Hearing", was upon the east. The third hill formed the island of [[Tol Brandir]]. None ever set foot upon the island due to its sheer cliffs that rose directly from the river.<ref name="Break">{{FR|II10}}</ref>

== In [[Third Age]] {{TA|3019|n}} ==
The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] arrived at Nen Hithoel on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and made camp at [[Parth Galen]] close to Amon Hen. The fall of [[Boromir]] and the breaking of the Fellowship occurred soon after. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] took a boat for the eastern shore skirting the southern edge of Tol Brandir,<ref name="Break"/> [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were captured by [[Orcs]],<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref> and after sending Boromir's body over the falls in another boat, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], calling themselves the ''[[Three Hunters]]'', set out to track the Orcs and find the captive [[Hobbits]].<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Nen Hithoel is a [[Sindarin]] name, translated by Tolkien as "Mist-cool Water" in his unfinished index of the Lord of the Rings<ref name="Index">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Unfinished Index", cited in: [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', pp. 327-8</ref>. The elements are ''[[nen]]'' = "water", ''[[hîth]]'' = "mist" and ''oel'' "cool" (not otherwise attested). Note that the ([[Noldorin]]) word ''[[oel]]'' appeared in the earlier Etymologies of the 1930s with the meaning "pool, lake", but this word had changed to (Sindarin) ''[[ael]]'' by the time that the Lord of the Rings was written, and therefore could not have been an element of the name Nen Hithoel. Compare, for example, [[Aelin-uial]] with its earlier form Oelin-uial.<ref name="Etymologies">{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''AY'''</ref>
