The '''Esgaliant''' or '''Iant Iaur''' as it became known in later days, was a bridge over the [[Esgalduin]].

The bridge was great and made of stone,<ref>{{UT|Narn}}</ref> part of the great road that ran north of [[Doriath]] and connected [[Brithiach]] to [[Arossiach]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The '''Bridge of Esgalduin''' was made long before [[Morgoth]] came to [[Beleriand]], perhaps by [[Dwarves]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Iant Iaur"</ref>

After terror entered the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] and the land to its south became deserted, the road and bridge fell into decay, and it was referred to as Iant Iaur, the Old Bridge.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Iant Iaur'' means "Old Bridge", from ''[[iant]]'' "bridge" and ''[[iaur]]'' "old".
