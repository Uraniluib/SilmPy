The '''Slag-hills''' were great mounds of debris, composed of blasted stone and earth, that had been piled over many years by toiling Orcs in front of the [[Morannon]].<ref name=Opens>{{RK|V10}}</ref>

On [[4 March]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] came to the Slag-hills and hid in a hollow.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>  The next day Frodo prepared to enter [[Mordor]] by the Black Gate but was persuaded by Gollum to head south to seek a more [[Cirith Ungol|secret way]] through the mountains.<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref>

Approaching the Black Gate on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}, [[Aragorn]] arrayed his meager forces on two of the Slag-hills behind a "moat" of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools.  It was upon these low hills that the [[Army of the West]] was surrounded and attacked by the forces of [[Sauron]] in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and it was here that they witnessed the downfall of Sauron when Frodo completed his quest.<ref name=Opens/>
