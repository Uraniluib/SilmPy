The '''Northfarthing''' was the cold northern [[Farthings|Farthing]] of [[the Shire]].

==Geography==
The Northfarthing is the only one of the four farthings that doesn't end in the [[Three-Farthing Stone]]; its southernmost point lay about eleven miles north of it<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> and along its northern border were the high [[North Moors]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

It had fresh and fragrant air; when [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] entered [[Ithilien]] for the first time, the air of the region reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>

The North Moors was the only place in the Shire where heavy snow was common.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

===Geographic Features===
The farthing contains [[Bindbole Wood]], a river (perhaps the [[Norbourn]]), and the [[Northway]] Road that led to the town of [[Oatbarton]].

Northfarthing was rocky, and settlements like [[Hardbottle]] were delved in or made from its stones.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref>

A branch of the [[Took Family]] called the [[North-took Family|North-tooks]] lived in a town called [[Long Cleeve]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> Given the reference to the north (when most Tooks lived in the [[Westfarthing]]), Long Cleeve was probably located in the Northfarthing.

==History==
The only notable historic event that ever occurred in the Northfarthing was the [[Battle of Greenfields]] ({{TA|2747}}).<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> It was the only battle fought with the boundaries of the Shire until the [[Battle of Bywater]].

Around the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Halfred Gamgee]] removed to Northfarthing.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
