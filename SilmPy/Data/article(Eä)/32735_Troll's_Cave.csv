The '''Troll's Cave''' was the hideout of the three [[trolls]], [[Tom]], [[Bert]] and [[William]] that captured [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the dwarves. The cave served as their hideout from the [[Sun]] and also their treasury and storeroom.

==Description==
The cave floor had bones and an untidy litter of plunder, from brass button to pots of gold. On shelves was a good deal of food, along with a barrel of ale. Clothing of victims hung on the walls as well as several swords. There was also a horrible smell in the air.

==History==
{{quote|One may guess that your [[trolls]] had plundered, other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hole in the mountains of old. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of [[Moria]], since the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|dwarf and goblin war]].|[[Elrond]]<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>}}
After [[Gandalf]] had rescued [[Thorin]] and his party, he reminded them that the trolls must have a cave or hole to hide in from the sun. Searching about, they followed the marks of stony boots uphill to a big stone door hidden by bushes. Pushing and incantations by Gandalf did not open it. Then Bilbo asked if the key he had found would help. It did.

The party took much of the food, the barrel of ale, and the gold. Gandalf and Thorin took two swords with beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts, and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath (which for a hobbit was as good as a short sword). Outside the cave the party ate and rested, and then buried the pots of gold near the river with many spells put over them.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

Later in [[Rivendell]] it was [[Elrond]] who read the runes on the swords of Gandalf and Thorin. He revealed that they were very old and had been made by the High Elves of the West, in [[Gondolin]]. Thus from the troll’s cave Thorin obtained [[Orcrist]] the Goblin-cleaver and Gandalf got [[Glamdring]] the Foe-hammer.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref> Much later Bilbo would name his short sword from the troll’s cave "[[Sting]]".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the manuscript for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Company found something else in the Troll's cave besides the three swords - they also found the key to the [[Back Door]] of the [[Lonely Mountain]], although they did not know it at the time.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 97</ref> Gandalf took charge of the key in the cave and gave it to Thorin just before he departed from the Company at the gates of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}, p. 244</ref> On [[Durin's Day]] it was Bilbo who recalled the troll-key and they found that it was the right one to open the door.<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
