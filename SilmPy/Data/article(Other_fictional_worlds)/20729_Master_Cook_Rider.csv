'''Rider''' was the name of a [[Master Cook]] of [[Wootton Major]], the earliest to be mentioned in ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''.  It is strongly implied in the work that he explored the world and discovered where the mysterious land of [[Faery]] lay.

==History==
Although Rider was known only to the people of Wootton Major as a cook, he had a long history of peregrination.  Eventually he settled down in the sleepy village of Wootton Major, and held the prestigious title of Master Cook.  He married a woman of the village and had a daughter who married a man named Smith and had a young child called [[Smith Smithson]].  One day, however, Rider took a vacation, something unheard of in Wootton Major.<ref>''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''/''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Thirtieth Printing [[Ballantine Books]] 1991 p. 11.</ref>

He was gone for a few months, but during that time he entered the land of Faery, met the [[Alf|King of Faery]], and picked up a [[Fay-star]].  He returned with the King of Faery disguised as a youth called Alf; it is not said whether or not Rider knew who the youth was when he first met him, but it is indicated that if not he eventually learned.<ref>ibid., p. 44. "''He left it [the fay-star] behind in the hope that it might come to you, his only grandchild.  So he told me, for he thought that I could arrange that.''"</ref>  Alf became his apprentice.  The people noted that after his return he was very merry and sang songs, but were suspicious of his choice of a "foreigner," Alf, as his successor.

Three years later, Rider abruptly told Alf farewell and departed, saying that he was going on a holiday and was not to return.<ref>ibid., p. 12.</ref>  He entrusted Alf with the fay-star, wishing that Alf could manage it to pass to his young grandson Smith Smithson, then two years old.<ref>ibid., p. 44.</ref>  A man named [[Nokes]] was made Great Cook after his departure, but nonetheless Rider got his wish and Alf caused the fay-star to go to his grandchild at the [[Feast of Good Children]].
