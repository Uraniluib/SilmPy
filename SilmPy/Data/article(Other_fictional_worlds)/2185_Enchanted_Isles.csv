The '''Enchanted Isles''' or '''Magic Isles''' were an archipelago in [[Belegaer]], east of [[Tol Eressëa]].

The archipelago was set by the [[Valar]] after the [[Flight of the Noldor]] to shield [[Valinor]] and Tol Eressëa. They had an uncertain number and no charted course could go through them, and as such they ensnared any ships trying to reach [[Aman]] without permission.  Additionally the seas about them were filled with mists.  The isles were enchanted, and anyone who set foot on them fell asleep forever.  The creation of the Enchanted Isles and the Shadowy Seas was part of the ''[[Nurtalë Valinóreva]]'', the Hiding of Valinor.<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

However, when [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] came upon the Enchanted Isles in [[Vingilótë]] they passed through successfully.  This may be attributed to the [[Silmaril]] that Eärendil wore upon his brow as they sailed into the West.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

The isles were apparently either removed from [[Arda]] or at least made less sinister after the [[War of Wrath]], as Tol Eressëa could be seen from [[Meneltarma]] on [[Númenor]] without problems. Certainly after the [[Akallabêth]] they were gone.

There is some confusion in the texts about these islands: the names "Enchanted Isles" and "Magic Isles" are both used, and at points it seems like they are different isles, but at other points they are equated as the same.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}} (see especially Note 9)</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In an early map of [[Arda]] titled ''[[I Vene Kemen]]'' (q.v.) the Magic Isles are noted, with the [[Qenya]] name ''I Tolli Kuruvar''.

In ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series the isles are also the location of the '''[[Tower of Pearl]]''' where the "sleeper" (possibly [[Tuor]] or [[Idril]]) rests, a reference which was later dropped from the mythology, although it remains uncertain if this was due to compression or rejection.
==In other stories==
The Magic Isles are referenced in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]''. In the story, written down in [[1927]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes the enchanted dog [[Rover|Roverandom]] (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the [[Shadowy Seas]] to the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Fairyland]] beyond the Magic Isles where Rover saw the [[Pelóri|Mountains of Elvenhome]] and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of [[Tirion|a city of Elves on a green hill far away in the distance]].<ref name="Roverandom">{{HM|R}}, pp. 73-4</ref>
