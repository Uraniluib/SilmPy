'''Bill Stickers''' was a villain â€” a figure in a "long-running family epic" told by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to his children. The stories "revolved around the tireless efforts of Major Road Ahead to prosecute the villain".<ref name=Bio>{{HM|Bio}}, Chapter 7</ref>

Bill Stickers was  an "irrepressible villain" and "a huge hulk of a man who always got away with everything".<ref name=Olney>{{webcite|author=Austin Olney|articleurl=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/lotr/author.shtml|articlename=About J.R.R.

==Inspiration==

Tolkien was inspired by "signs hanging on various Oxford gates",<ref name=Bio/> saying "Bill Stickers Will Be Prosecuted".<ref name=Olney/><ref group=note>It's an old prank to paste up posters with 'Bill Stickers is Innocent' underneath these sign (cf. [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/bill-stickers-is-innocent.html Bill Stickers is innocent]).</ref> Basing his discussion on a newspaper article revealing that [[C.S. Lewis]] was a member a secret gang during the 1920s,<ref>{{webcite|author=Thomas Burrows|articleurl=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10737947.CS_Lewis_supported_secret_heritage_gang/|articlename=CS Lewis supported secret heritage gang|dated=15 October 2013|website=[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk OxfordMail.co.uk]|accessed=12 November 2013}}</ref> [[David Bratman]] has speculated that Tolkien in addition might have been inspired by the gang member Margaret Pollard's (a friend of Lewis's) gang pseudonym, "Bill Stickers".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Bratman]]|articleurl=http://kalimac.livejournal.com/694167.html|articlename=ten miscellanies make a blog post|dated=5 November 2013|website=[http://kalimac.livejournal.com/ Kalimac.livejournal.com]|accessed=12 November 2013}}</ref>

The stories about Bill Stickers and Major Road Ahead were only told orally (possibly around [[1926]] and [[1930]]<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 135</ref>), and have thus not been recorded,<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 162</ref> unlike, for example, ''[[Roverandom]]'' and ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]''.
