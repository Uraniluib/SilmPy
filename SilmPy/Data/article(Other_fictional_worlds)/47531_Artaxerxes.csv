[[File:Alan Lee - Artaxerxes.jpg|thumb|right|Artaxerxes by [[Alan Lee]]]]'''Artaxerxes''' is the wizard, and main antagonist, in ''[[Roverandom]]''. Artaxerxes is described as an old man in ragged trousers wearing a green hat with a blue feather.<ref name="Roverandom">{{HM|R}}</ref>{{rp|1}} Originally from [[wikipedia:Persia|Persia]], he ended up in [[wikipedia:Pershore|Pershore]] by mistake.<ref name="Roverandom"/>{{rp|14}}

After Artaxerxes picks up [[Rover]]'s yellow ball, Rover demands it back without saying "please". Rover bites Artaxerxes trousers when he continues to refuse to return the ball; in retaliation, Artaxerxes turns Rover into a toy dog and transports Rover to a toy shop.<ref name="Roverandom"/>{{rp|1-2}} Although Rover visits the [[Man-in-the-Moon]] with the help of [[Mew]], and seeks the help of the sand-sorcerer [[Psamathos Psamathides]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes Roverandom (as he is now known) to ask Artaxerxes to return him to being a normal dog.

Artaxerxes is living at the bottom of the Deep Blue Sea and is married to the daughter of the Mer-king. As a wizard, he has been appointed Pacific and Atlantic Magician and is known as '''PAM'''. All the woes of the mer-people are blamed on PAM, including the emergence of a Sea-serpent. Because he is so deeply unpopular, PAM leaves with his wife and Roverandom: he takes Roverandom with him as the dog continues to be polite and show faith in his magical abilities.<ref name="Roverandom"/>{{rp|55 ff}}

Back on land, Artaxerxes turns Roverandom back into a real dog. Wearing a purple velvet suit, Artaxerxes sets up a chocolate and cigarette shop by the beach (selling [[wikipedia:Rock (confectionery)|Pam's Rock]]), whilst his wife gave swimming lessons.<ref name="Roverandom"/>{{rp|83-7}}
