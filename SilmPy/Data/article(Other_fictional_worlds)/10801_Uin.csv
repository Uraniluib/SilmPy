'''Uin''' was a great [[whales|whale]] in the service of [[Ulmo]], who used to drag [[Tol Eressëa]] towards [[Valinor]] in the earlier versions of the [[legendarium]]. Uin also pulled Ulmo's [[fishy cart]],<ref>{{HM|LT1}}</ref>, and is said to be the "primeval whale".<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 97</ref> Uin does not appear in any later version of the legendarium, and his role seems to have been merged with Ulmo himself. 
==Etymology==
In the ''Gnomish Lexicon'', the word ''uin'' means "whale". The original meaning of ''uin'' seems to have been "wave". Another [[Gnomish]] word for whale was ''uimoth'', "sheep of the waves" (incorporating ''[[moth]]'').<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}</ref>
