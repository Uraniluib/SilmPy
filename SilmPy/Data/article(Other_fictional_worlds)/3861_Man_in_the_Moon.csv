In the folklore of the [[Hobbits]], the '''Man in the Moon''' is an old being who secretly hid on the island of the [[Moon]], and built his minaret there.<ref>{{AB|6}}</ref><ref>{{AB|5}}</ref> He is also featured in the song ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]''.<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

Combined with the [[Elves|Elven]] lore, the Man in the Moon of the Hobbits' tales must have his origins in the legend of [[Tilion]] the [[Maia]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entries "Man in the Moon", "Tilion"</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', a creature living on the moon is mentioned, although his nature and the tale of how he came to live there was never fully told. In that version of the legendarium there were no Hobbits, and the Man in the Moon was mentioned in the context of Elven lore, alongside the [[Valar]] and Maiar; his name in [[Qenya]] was  '''''Uolë Kúvion'''''.<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, pp. 193, 198, 215, 271</ref>

==Other writings==
In Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]'' the '''Man-in-the-Moon''' is the greatest of all magicians and also lives in a white tower in the moon with a telescope. He has a moon-dog named Rover and when [[Rover]] comes to the moon, he renames him "Roverandom" and gives him wings to play with the moon-dog. After staying in the moon and having many adventures, Roverandom is told by the Man-in-the-Moon that [[Artaxerxes]] has now left, and is allowed to return to Earth.<ref>{{HM|R}}</ref>

The Man in the Moon appears also in ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]'': In [[1926]], the [[North Polar Bear]] lit the northern lights causing the moon to break and the Man fall in [[Father Christmas]]'s hut and ate all his chocolate before he climbed back to mend it and tidy up the stars.<ref>{{LFC|1926}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
The [[Wikipedia:Man in the Moon|Man in the Moon]] is a real-life tradition referring to a figure on the moon disc that appears like a face.
