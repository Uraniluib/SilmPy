'''Wootton Minor''' was the name of a village in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s story, ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''.  It lay a few miles away from [[Wootton Major]], which was named as such because it was larger than Wootton Minor (although neither was very large).  When [[Nan Smithson]] grew up she moved to Wootton Minor and had a son [[Tom (son of Nan)|Tom]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
