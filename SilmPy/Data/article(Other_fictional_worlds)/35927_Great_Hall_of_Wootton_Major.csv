The '''Great Hall of Wootton Major''' was the meeting place of the village [[Wootton Major]] wherein the villagers held meetings, debates, public feasts, and family gatherings.  Adjoined to the Great Hall were the Cook's House and the Kitchen, for the [[Master Cook]] was an important person in the village who provided suitable fare for all of the gatherings.  It was also the site for the winter festival and the [[Feast of Good Children]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
