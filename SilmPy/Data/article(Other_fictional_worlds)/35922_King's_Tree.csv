The '''Kingâ€™s Tree''' was a great tree that [[Smith Smithson]] saw only once in the land of [[Faery]].  Smith had gotten lost one time in a grey mist.  When the fog rolled away he was in a wide plain.  Far away he espied a hill of shadow, yet out of the shadow rose the King's Tree.  High it towered with a light like the sun at noon.  It was laden with leaves, flowers, and fruits uncountable and was the only one of its kind.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
