'''Harry''' was one of the children who attended the [[Feast of Good Children]] when [[Smith Smithson]] ate the [[Fay-star]] that had been put in the [[Great Cake]].  Long after he had retired, the [[Master Cook]] at that occasion, [[Nokes]], was trying to figure out who had swallowed the Fay-star and he remembered Harry, the Cooper's son.  Nokes claimed that Harry was a barrel of a boy with a fat mouth like a frog.  [[Alf]], who had been Nokes' apprentice at the time, reprovingly said that Harry was a nice boy with a large friendly grin.  He had not eaten the star because he had carefully cut his slice of the Cake to pieces before eating and had found nothing.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
