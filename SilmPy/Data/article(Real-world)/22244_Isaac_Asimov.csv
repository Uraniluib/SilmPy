'''Isaac Asimov''' (Russian: '''Исаак Озимов''') (c. [[2 January|January 2]], [[1920]] - [[6 April|April 6]], [[1992]]) was a prolific science fiction author and polemic. As such, some of his writings discuss [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s thematics, especially [[the One Ring]].

In a letter written to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer in 1967, Tolkien said that he seldom found any modern books that could hold his attention. One exception though was the science fiction of Isaac Asimov, which Tolkien said he enjoyed.<ref>{{L|294}}</ref>

In an interview conducted in [[1988]], Asimov said that he "likes" Tolkien and that he has "read it five times" (likely referring to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').<ref>Slawek Wojtowicz, [http://www.slawcio.com/asimov.html Dr Isaac Asimov Talks with Slawek Wojtowicz] (conducted 27 August 1988) at [http://www.slawcio.com/ Slawcio.com] (accessed 2 September 2011)</ref>
