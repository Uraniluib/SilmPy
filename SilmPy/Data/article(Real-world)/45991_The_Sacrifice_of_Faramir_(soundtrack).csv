'''The Sacrifice of Faramir''' is the fourth track of disc two of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - The Complete Recordings]]'' by [[Howard Shore]]. The track features "The Edge of Night", a song sung by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in the halls of [[Denethor]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. The song greatly resembles ''[[A Walking Song]]'' sung by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and Pippin in the chapter "[[Three is Company]]". The song was also used in the first trailer for ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.

==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread
Through shadow to the edge of night
Until the stars are all alight.

Mist and shadow, cloud and shade,
All shall fade, all shall fade.
</poem>
