On [[17 April]] [[1967]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to J.D. Gilbert'''.<ref name=C>{{CG|C}}, p. 696</ref>

*'''Subject:''' Tolkien suggests Gilbert to read ''[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth]]'', commenting that "''I think one of the reasons why books read in childhood lose their charm later is that many of them are very ill-written, and this fault is not (consciously) noted by the uncritical and inexperienced reader''". Tolkien also explains that he is "''under contract to publish the legends and stories of the eras before the [[Third Age]]''" but that he is finding that time is going too quickly.
*'''Description:''' Typed letter signed with autograph additions in black fountain pen ink (five words), on his Professor J.R.R. Tolkien letterhead, Oxford, 76 Sandfield Road, April 17, 1967. 7" x 9", 1 page (recto only).
*'''Publication:''' A description of the letter was published in [[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide|''The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Chronology'']] (p. 696).
