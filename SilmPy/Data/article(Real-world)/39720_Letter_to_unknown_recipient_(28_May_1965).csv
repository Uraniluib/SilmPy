On [[28 May]] [[1965]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R.

*'''Description:''' A young girl from New Zealand had written to Tolkien "''a letter about genealogy and hobbit recipes for cooking rabbits, Tolkien's secretary wrote back a nice reply and Tolkien personally added a few lines and signed the letter''".<ref name=Flavin>{{webcite|author=Richard Flavin|articleurl=http://www.flavinscorner.com/tolkienletter.htm|articlename=Tolkien Letter|dated=|website=[http://www.flavinscorner.com/ Flavin's Corner]|accessed=14 June 2012}}</ref>
*'''Publication:''' The letter is mentioned by [[Christopher Tolkien]] in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'': 

"''On one of his copies of the First Edition he added to the genealogy of the [[Tooks]] (Fredegar's mother being [[Rosamunda Took]]) 'Estella' as the sister of [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar]] and her birth-date {{SR|1385|n}}; and to the [[Brandybuck]] genealogy he added to Meriadoc's '= [[Estella Bolger]] 1385', noting beside this that he had told a correspondent in [[1965]] that 'I believe he married a sister of Fredegar Bolger of the Bolgers of [[Budgeford]]'.  These corrections, for a reason unknown to me, were not incorporated in the [[Allen and Unwin]] Second Edition, but they did occur in a later impression of the [[Ballantine]] edition of [[1966]], and hence Estella Bolger and her marriage to Merry Brandybuck are entered in ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' by [[Robert Foster]].''

''These additions to the family trees were made at the instance of [[Douglas A. Anderson]] in the [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition of [[1987]], to which he contributed a note on the history of the text.  Estella Bolger and her marriage to Meriadoc have finally entered the British 'tradition' in the re-set edition published by [[HarperCollins]] in [[1994]] (see Douglas Anderson's 'Note on the text' in this edition, p. xii).''"<ref>{{PM|III}}, p. 117 (note 1)</ref>

==Excerpt==
[Tolkien's added lines:]
{{blockquote|I believe he married a sister of<br/>[[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar (Fatty) Bolger]], but I<br/>will look into the matter.  I have some<br/>records of the family of the [[Bolger Family|Bolgers]] of [[Budgeford|Budgeford]],<br/>whose lands were not far from [[Buckland]], but they were<br/>for lack of space not included.  J. R. R. Tolkien}}
