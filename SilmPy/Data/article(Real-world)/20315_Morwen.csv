'''Morwen''' was a daughter of [[Baragund]] of the [[House of Bëor]], and she married [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]]. She was the mother of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], [[Lalaith]], and [[Nienor]]. She is described as being tall, slender and fair, having a stern and cold disposition. Her son Túrin, but not her daughters, inherited her tendency to keep her emotions and thoughts to herself. <ref name=UT2> {{UT|2}}"</ref>

==History==
Morwen was the daughter of [[Baragund]], [[Lord of Ladros]]. She belonged to the [[House of Beor]] and married [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]] and [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. They had three children together, [[Túrin]], [[Lalaith]], and [[Nienor]]. Lalaith perished to the [[Evil Breath]], a plague of Morgoth, when she was a young child.

After Húrin's departure to fight for [[Fingon]] at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Morwen, who was pregnant to their third child, remained in her husband's house as the Lady of [[Dor-Lómin]]. After Morgoth's victory at the Nirnaeth, hordes of [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] who had betrayed the [[Edain]], [[Incomers|invaded]] [[Hithlum]]. Even though they took control of the land, they left Morwen and her household alone for a while, believing her to be a witch with dealings with the Elves. She was indeed in contact with small groups of Elves living in the mountains close to her house, but from them she received only information, and that very scant.

Eventually she thought it best to send her only surviving child, Túrin, to [[Doriath]] with [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]] to seek refuge. Being pregnant, and out of fear of drawing the Easterlings' attention, Morwen herself remained in Dor-Lómin.

Túrin was adopted by King [[Thingol]], who sent messengers back to [[Hithlum]] bringing her news about Túrin's well-being, invitations from Thingol and gifts from [[Melian]]. But she refused to leave her home, not the least because her daughter [[Nienor]] was still a baby.<ref name=UT2/> In her stead she sent to Túrin the dragon-crested [[Helm of Hador]], the heirloom of their house.<ref>{{cH|4}}</ref>

Morwen's house was oppressed by [[Brodda]]'s Easterlings. Meanwhile, Túrin had exiled himself out of Doriath and made himself a hero. The fame of the [[Black Sword]] reached to Hithlum, saying that he was cleansing [[Beleriand]] from perils, without Morwen knowing that he was her own son. Nienor now had grown up, and Morwen eventually fled the tyranny of Hithlum through [[Ered Wethrin]] and came to Doriath, only to find out that her son had left.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref> Túrin's travels also brought him to the north and liberated Dor-Lómin, but it was too late, as Morwen and Nienor had long gone. 

Having learned that Túrin was under [[Orodreth]]'s service in [[Nargothrond]], she left Doriath to go there. [[Mablung]] was tasked to accompany her. Unknown to both, [[Nienor]] had joined them. The women were left back upon [[Amon Ethir]] and Mablung set out with a small company to scout Nargothrond as were his orders by Thingol. Yet [[Glaurung]] left Nargothrond and Mablung was unable to prevent them both from getting ensnared in the traps of the [[Dragon]]. 

Morwen was then lost and Mablung heard no news from her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

Morwen, now in her fifties, came to the [[Forest of Brethil]] and found the graves of her children at [[Cabed Naeramarth]]. Húrin found her there. She felt already spent and she asked her husband how their son found his sister; but Húrin never replied. They spent the night together until she passed away with the sun. Húrin dug for her a grave above Cabed Naeramarth on the west side of the [[Stone of the Hapless]] cutting the words ''Here lies also Morwen Eledhwen''.

According to the words of [[Glirhuin]], the mound survived the [[War of Wrath]] and as [[Tol Morwen]] was the westernmost isle off the coast of [[Lindon]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Morwen means "Dark Maiden" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[môr]]'' = "darkness, dark, night" and ''[[gwenn]]'' = "maiden"). Her epithet, 
Eledhwen, means "Elf-maiden" (from ''[[edhel]]'' = "Elf" and ''[[gwenn]]'' = "maiden"); [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] also translates it as "Elfsheen", which is a rendering of [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:ælf-scīene|ælf-scīene]]'' "bright as [[fairy]], of elfin beauty". Both definitions are in reference to her noble bearing.
