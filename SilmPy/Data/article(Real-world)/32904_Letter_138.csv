==Summary==
Galley-proofs of Volume I of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were sent to Tolkien in mid-July.  Tolkien told his son that they had proven a bore.  They were endless and did seem long-winded in parts.  The printing was good but the impertinent compositors had put in corrections: altering ''dwarves'' to ''dwarfs'', ''elvish'' to ''elfish'', ''further'' to ''farther'', and the worst, ''elven'' to ''elfin''.  Irritated, Tolkien had shot a "snorter" to [[Allen and Unwin]] which had produced a grovel.
