On [[28 March]] [[1956]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to Patricia Kirke'''.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 831</ref>

*'''Contents:''' Tolkien writes about his sufferings from bad health and a heavy work load, and "the endless concerns of the additional role of author, involved with Income Tax, agreements, translation rights, and the clamour for more". He will attempt to ignore these issues while celebrating Easter; however, while he  approves "in the abstract of the reform of the liturgy... one feels a little dislocated and even a little sad at my age to know that the ceremonies and modes so long familiar and  deeply associated with the season will never be heard again!".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 487</ref>
*'''Publication:''' The letter first appeared in ''[[Gerard A.J. Stodolski Catalogue 299]]'', and later in ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]''.
