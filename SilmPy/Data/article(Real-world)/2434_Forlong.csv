'''Forlong''' was the [[Lord of Lossarnach]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==

Forlong rode to the aid of Minas Tirith with two hundred of his men. His men bore great battle-axes and were well-armed.<ref name="MT"/> Forlong fought bravely in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], but the opposition proved too strong. Separated from his men and his horse slain, Forlong was killed. He was remembered in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>
