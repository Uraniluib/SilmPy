==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Is Tolkien's work Christian or pagan? This question has intrigued readers and scholars ever since The Lord of the Rings has been published. Even today this important problem has not been given the full critical attention it deserves, and the present volume is an attempt to provide an answer. The volume contains a comprehensive bibliography on the subject, detailed indices, a foreword by [[Verlyn Flieger]], and an afterword by [[Tom Shippey]].}}
