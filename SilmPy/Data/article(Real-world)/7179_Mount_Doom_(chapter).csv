'''Mount Doom''' is the third chapter of the second book in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

==Summary==
The next morning, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] gained new strength and a grim sense of responsibility. He woke [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and pushed him on toward [[Orodruin]]. The land before them was cold and dead, dotted by countless craters and hollows. The [[Hobbits]] crawled eastward from hiding place to hiding place. After a few miles, Frodo was nearly spent, his mind and body tormented by the terrible weight of [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. He refused to give it to Sam, for he knew he was held by its power. The two decided to take to the road once again. All eyes in [[Mordor]] were turned to the west, where the Captains marched toward Morannon.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref>

After three draining days of travel, Frodo’s limbs gave way and he fell, exhausted. Sam picked Frodo up and carried him on his back. Before nightfall, they reached the foot of the mountain. Sam carefully made his way up the slope. It was nearly morning. For a moment, the shadows dissipated, and Sam could see the flicker of the piercing Eye from [[Sauron]]’s Dark Tower. Its gaze passed by the hobbits and turned to the north, focusing on the [[Captains of the West]]. However, the glimpse of Sauron’s power caused Frodo to panic. His hand grasped for the Ring around his neck, and he cried for Sam’s help. Sam knelt beside Frodo and gently held his master’s palms together in his lap.

Afraid Sauron had spotted them, Sam took Frodo upon his shoulders once more and continued up the mountain. With much difficulty, they finally reached the top. Sam looked down over a great cliff into the burning [[Cracks of Doom]] below. Suddenly, a cruel weight hit Sam from behind, and he fell forward. Behind him, he heard the voice of [[Gollum]], cursing Frodo viciously for his treachery. Frodo and Gollum engaged in a violent struggle, and Gollum proved stronger than the weakened Frodo. Suddenly, Frodo commanded Gollum, “Begone, and trouble me no more!” and the creature fell to his knees. Frodo pressed on to the Cracks of Doom. Sam, tempted to slay Gollum with his sword, refrained out of pity. Gollum crawled away.

Reaching the Cracks, Frodo turned to Sam and, with a voice clearer than Sam had ever heard, informed him that he would not complete the quest. The Ring, Frodo declared, was his. He put the Ring on his finger and vanished. Sam was once again flung aside, and then he saw a dark shape leap over him. Just as Sam looked up, the Great Eye of Sauron suddenly became aware of Frodo. The eight remaining [[Nazgûl]] hurtled toward the mountain at terrifying speed.

Sam saw Gollum struggling with an invisible enemy, biting at the air viciously. Frodo suddenly reappeared, his hand bleeding from his severed finger. Gollum pulled Frodo’s finger and the Ring from his mouth joyfully, and danced around, unaware that he was close to the edge of the cliff. Gollum then fell, along with the Ring, into the Cracks of Doom, murmuring his last word, ''"precious."'' Mount Doom shook violently as it accepted and consumed the Ring. Sam ran out into the daylight, carrying Frodo. The Nazgûl withered in the fiery ruin of the hill. Frodo stood by Sam’s side, himself again. Sam felt overjoyed, and Frodo explained that, were it not for Gollum, he would not have been able to finish the quest. Frodo said he was glad to be with Sam “at the end of all things.”
