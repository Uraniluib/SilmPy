'''Tolkien News''' was a not-for-profit website which sought to aggregate [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-related news, in direct competition with the more commercial [http://www.theonering.net TheOneRing.net].

Tolkien News was founded on [[1 January|January 1]], [[2006]], however, as [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] (the founder) was tasked with the sole responsibility of its upkeep the site closed in 2008.
