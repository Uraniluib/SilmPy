A '''Tolkienist''' is someone who studies the work and [[legendarium]] of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

A Tolkienist can also be described as a hard-core fan of Tolkien's work, one who studies the work with the same amount of interest (or more) that others study non-fictional subjects. Tolkienists can usually be students of the [[Elvish]] languages. 

There are also other, less widely used terms describing Tolkien fans, such as '''Tolkienites''', '''Tolkienophiles''' or '''Tolkiendili''' (an Anglo-[[Quenya]] compound). 

A very early term which was never widely adopted was '''LotRians'''. As with the term [[Ringers|Ringer]], there is no group consensus on this designation. "Ringer" however implies limitation to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
