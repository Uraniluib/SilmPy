===Summary===
This letter told about Tolkien's (according to him) somewhat boring day drilling and attending classes. Near the end, however, he remarks: "''There was a bad paper but an interesting discussion. It was also composition meeting and I read '[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast|Earendel]]' which was well criticised.''"
