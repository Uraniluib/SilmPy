==Summary==
In [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Rehabilitations and Other Essays]]'' there was a short poem in which Tolkien and Lewis, while discussing [[dragons]], heard a workman in the bar claimed to have seen dragons himself.  About the poem, Tolkien said that Jack<ref group="note">"Jack" was Lewis's nickname.</ref> had produced lines that were not entirely accurate examples of Old English metrical devices.  The occasion was fictitious, Tolkien never having seen a dragon or any man who said he had.  Tolkien recalled Jack telling him a story about F.E. Brightman, an ecclesiastical scholar.  One night there was a discussion in the Common Room about dragons and Brightman said, "I have seen a dragon."  "Where was that?"  "On the Mount of Olives", Brightman replied, never explaining then or later what he meant.
