'''Herumor''' was a [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] who lived in the late [[Second Age]]. After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] he, along with [[Fuinur]], rose to power among the [[Haradrim]] and served [[Sauron]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

== Etymology ==

Herumor means "Black Lord" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[heru]]'' = "lord" and ''[[morë]]'' = "dark").

==Portrayal in adaptations==

In the defunct [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game from the 1980s, Herumor is given an extended history. Fuinur is then his older brother. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], however, had nothing to do with writing this history.
