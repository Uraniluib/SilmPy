'''Dr. Kirstin Jeffrey Johnson''' is a [[George MacDonald]] scholar, and a free-lance writer and lecturer based in the Ottawa Valley, Canada. Her doctoral studies (Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts, University of St Andrews) considered the concept of Mythopoesis / Mythopoeia as defined by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]], and as attributed to George MacDonald – how and why MacDonald earned their acknowledgment as a great mythopoeic writer, and MacDonald’s own mythopoeic intent. Her writings include studies of the work of Tolkien, Lewis, MacDonald, [[Charles Williams]], and [[Owen Barfield]].
