==From the publisher== 
===1927 edition===
All who love Peter Pan will also love this story for children of every age and every kind

The book opens with a description of a Settlement for Superfluous Children. A little to the north of the Settlement Vanderdecken and his crew are in shore quarters; the ''Flying Dutchman'' anchored close by. To the south are the amicable if unintelligent Snergs, some off-shoot of the pixies. Rather naughtily Joe and Sylvia run away, and in the company of Gorbo - of all Snergs least intelligent - get mixed up with magic and find themselves ''the wrong side of the river''. Escapes from Golithos, an ogre imperfectly reformed; from Mother Meldrum, that sinister witch; from the wicked King Kul; and the rescue by Vanderdecken and the Snergs, fill a joyous volume.<ref name=AH/>
