{{blockquote|My Dear Chambers,<br/><br/>Thank you for your note. I am sorry you are — or were — unwell. My very best wishes for a happy feast and for all blessings in 1934.<br/><br/>Yrs very sincerely,<br/>J.R.R. Tolkien<br/><br/>I send you - it may possibly amuse you — a report on last year's Examinations in Oxford: held by myself, [[Charles Leslie Wrenn|Wrenn]], Brett-Smith & [[C.S. Lewis]] (whose ''Pilgrim's Regress'' you may have read). The howlers are genuine except the nonsense about Percy S.<br/><br/>Yrs<br/>J.R.R.T.}}
