'''''The History of Middle-earth''''' is a 12 volume series of books compiled and edited by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. In the volumes, Christopher Tolkien presents and discusses manuscripts by his father related to the stories of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Some of the material is revealed for the first time, while some consists of earlier versions of already published material.

The first two books introduce us to ''The Book of Lost Tales'', which eventually became ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The third volume deals with long poems concerning major characters in the First Age.  The following two books follow developments from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' to ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Volumes 6 through 9 discuss the development of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', while the second half of book 9 discusses the tale of NÃºmenor. Books 10 and 11 discuss the Annals of Beleriand and Annals of Aman, which served as source material for ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The final book entails the development of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Appendices, followed by a few assorted essays J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in the last years of his life.
