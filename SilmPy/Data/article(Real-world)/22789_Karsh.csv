'''Karsh the Whisperer''', born '''Carthean''', is a non-canon character, created specifically for [[Electronic Arts|EA]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He is voiced by [[Jason Connery]]. Karsh is playable as a hero in the Angmar faction.

==History== 
Carthean was a celebrated [[Arnor|Arnorian]] general. He defended [[Cardolan]], where the [[Barrow-downs|burial grounds of the deceased kings of Arnor]] lay, from the [[Witch-king]] and his servants. He failed, and at the end, [[Morgomir]] turned him into the [[wraiths|wraith]] Karsh. Since then, Karsh is devoted to the Iron Crown of [[Angmar]].
