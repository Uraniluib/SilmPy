'''''Gobeth e Lam Edhellen: The Sindarin Dictionary''''' is a [[Sindarin]]/English and [[Sindarin]]/Polish dictionary. It was first printed on paper, but a newer edition is only distributed on CD.

==From the publisher==

Ryszard Derdzinski's ''Sindarin Dictionary'' is now available on CD. On the date of its first publication it was the first such detailed dictionary of the language of the Grey Elves. Its editor had collected about 2000 Sindarin words found in all the published works by J.R.R. Tolkien and gave their English and Polish translations, grammar category, etymological information and sources. The Noldorin and Ilkorin words of "The Etymologies" are transformed to become similar to the Sindarin forms of the post-LotR period.
