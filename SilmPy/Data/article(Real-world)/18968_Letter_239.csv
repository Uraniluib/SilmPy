==Summary==
Tolkien wrote to [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] concerning the Spanish translation of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  A point of concern for Tolkien was the use of ''gnomos'' as the translation of "[[Dwarves]]" and "[[Noldor|Gnomes]]". He explained that he originally connected the word ''[[wikipedia:gnome|gnome]]'' to Greek ''wisdom'', but abandoned it because of its more common use for ''pygmaeus'' ("pygmy"). 

==Note==
The Spanish translation eventually used ''[[wiktionary:enanos|enanos]]'' for Dwarves; it is unknown whether the second suggestion was also followed.
