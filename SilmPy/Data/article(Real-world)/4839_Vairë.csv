'''Vairë the Weaver''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈvaɪre]}}) was a [[Valar|Valië]] and the wife of [[Mandos]].

The [[Valie]] was responsible for weaving the story of the World, with which the [[Halls of Mandos]] are clothed, and ever widen.<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

After the death of [[Finwë]], [[Míriel]] returned to life and entered the service of Vairë, recording all the deeds of the [[House of Finwë]].<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 207</ref>
==Etymology==
The [[Quenya]] name ''Vairë'' means "Weaver",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> or "Ever-weaving", derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[WIR]].<ref>{{VT|39a}}, pp. 10, 14 (form: ''Vaire'')</ref>

In the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', Quenya ''Vaire'' ("Weaver") is a descendant form of [[Primitive Quendian]] ''weirē'', deriving from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[WEY]] ("wind, weave").<ref name=LR/>

Her [[Noldorin]] name is said to be '''''Gwîr''''' ("Weaver").<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 398</ref> An early, [[Gnomish]] version of her name was ''Gwairil''.<ref>{{PE|15}}, pp. 6, 7, 9</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
A different [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] appeared in some of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s earliest writings. In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', she was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Tol Eressëa]], and the daughter of [[Tulkastor]]. She and her husband [[Lindo]] tell the stories that would become the [[Quenta Silmarillion|Silmarillion]] to the human mariner [[Ælfwine]]/[[Eriol]]. Her role as storyteller may have influenced the naming of the Vala responsible for recording stories.<ref>{{LT1 |I}}, p. 16</ref>
