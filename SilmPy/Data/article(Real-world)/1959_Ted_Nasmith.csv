'''Ted Nasmith''' is a Canadian artist who has done a tremendous amount of work involving [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s masterpieces.

==Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings==
Many fans of Ted Nasmith have expressed disappointment in his lack of involvement in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].
{{quote|I was contacted by a producer in early '99. They invited me to be there with the others in New Zealand to help with conceptual art, and made me a nice offer. However, I was going through a personal crisis unrelated to my art, and in the end, being that it would also force me to abandon my freelance obligations and be away indefinitely, I reluctantly declined, settling the question in my mind after very careful deliberation. It was a difficult decision.|Ted Nasmith [http://www.dreamish.com/artist/tednasmith.shtml]}}

One fan has created a website known as [http://tednasmith.narod.ru Ted Nasmith: The Uncredited Lord of the Rings Films Concept Artist]. The website displays side-by-side illustrations by Nasmith with later scenes in The Lord of the Rings films. [[Peter Jackson]] was inspired by Nasmith - as [[Alan Lee]] described: 
{{quote|"[T]here were certain pictures of Ted's that Peter quite liked. He actually bought one of Nasmith's originals --- a very striking picture of Mordor"|Alan Lee [http://einsiders.com/features/interviews/alanlee.php]}}
