[Tolkien apologises] for not having replied more fully, "I am having rather a bad time. I have left Oxford, and in the middle of the move I fell downstairs and damaged my right leg so badly that it is in plaster from toe to hip, and I am on crutches" and [gives] a reference to ''The Lord of the Rings'', "I notice Spire Hollin: very Shire-like. Hollin is northern form of holly: and in Book I of The L.R: I lived for a while in Leeds in a Hollin Lane".<ref name=Bloom>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.bloomsburyauctions.com/detail/642/156.0|articlename=Modern First Editions, English & Continental Literature & History, Emblem Books, Economics & Law 13th March 2008: Lot 156.
