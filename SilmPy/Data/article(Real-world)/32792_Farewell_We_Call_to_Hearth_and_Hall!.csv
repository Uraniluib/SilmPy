'''Farewell We Call to Hearth and Hall!''' is a song that was sung by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] at the house in [[Crickhollow]] after the "conspiracy" of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo's]] friends was revealed.  Merry and Pippin had composed it for the occasion, modeling it and setting it to the same tune as the [[Far over the misty mountains cold|dwarf-song]] that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] had heard in [[Bag End]] at the start of his adventure.  After it was sung Frodo praised the song and took the line "We must away ere break of day" literally, to Pippin's dismay.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Farewell we call to hearth and hall!
Though wind may blow and rain may fall,
We must away ere break of day
Far over wood and mountain tall.

To [[Rivendell]], where Elves yet dwell
In glades beneath the misty fell,
Through moor and waste we ride in haste,
And whither then we cannot tell. 

With foes ahead, behind us dread,
Beneath the sky shall be our bed,
Until at last our toil be passed,
Our journey done, our errand sped.

We must away! We must away!
We ride before the break of day!
</poem>
