'''''Kortirion among the Trees''''' is a poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Several versions of the poem exist, the earliest dating from November [[1915]]. In [[1937]], Tolkien undertook a major revision of the poem. The final version, entitled '''''The Trees of Kortirion''''', appears to have been composed "nearly half a century after" 1915.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, pp. 32-43</ref>

Three different versions of the poem were published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'': a pre-1937 version, the 1937 revision, and the final version.
