{{merge|A Walking Song}}
'''Upon the Hearth the Fire is Red''' is a poem found in [[Three is Company]], the third chapter of Book One of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Context==
The [[hobbits]] are walking through the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]] to [[Buckland]] when they begin to hum a walking song. The lyrics are by [[Bilbo Baggins]], set to a tune that was "as old as the hills". He had taught the song to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] during their walks in the lanes of the [[Water-valley]].

After the hobbits finish singing the song, they hear the sound of hooves.

==Text==
<poem>
Upon the hearth the fire is red,
Beneath the roof there is a bed;
But not yet weary are our feet,
Still round the corner we may meet
A sudden tree or standing stone
That none have seen but we alone.
Tree and flower and leaf and grass,
Let them pass! Let them pass!
Hill and water under sky,
Pass them by! Pass them by!

Still around the corner there may wait
A new road or a secret gate,
And though we pass them by today,
Tomorrow we may come this way
And take the hidden paths that run
Towards the [[Moon]] or to the [[Sun]].
Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe
Let them go! Let them go!
Sand and stone and pool and dell,
Fare you well! Fare you well!

Home is behind, the world ahead,
And there are many paths to tread
Through shadows to the edge of night,
Until the stars are all alight.
Then world behind and home ahead,
We'll wander back to home and bed.
Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,
Away shall fade! Away shall fade!
Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,
And then to bed! And then to bed!
</poem>

Home is behind. The world ahead.

Through shadow to the edge of night.
Until the stars are all alight.
Mist and shadows, cloud and shade.
All shall fade.  All shall fade.
