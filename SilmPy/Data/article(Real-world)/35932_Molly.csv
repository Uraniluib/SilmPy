'''Molly''' was one of the children who attended the [[Feast of Good Children]] when [[Smith Smithson]] ate the [[Fay-star]] that had been put in the [[Great Cake]].  Long after he had retired, the [[Master Cook]] at that occasion, [[Nokes]], was trying to figure out who had swallowed the Fay-star and he remembered Molly, the Miller's daughter.  Nokes claimed that Molly had been greedy and had bolted her food, and later had become as fat as a sack.  [[Alf]], who had been Nokes' apprentice at the time, said that Molly had not bolted her food and had not eaten the star since she found two trinkets in her slice.<ref>[[J.R.R.
