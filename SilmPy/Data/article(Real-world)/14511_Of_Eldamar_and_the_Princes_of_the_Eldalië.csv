'''Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië''' is the fifth chapter of the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] section within [[The Silmarillion]].

==Synopsis==
The chapter describes the end of the [[Great March]] of the [[Elves]] and the arrival to [[Valinor]] of the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] on the island [[Tol Eressëa]]. 

We are told how the [[Teleri]] were taught by [[Ossë]] in the shores of [[Beleriand]] and how they later became reluctant to leave [[Middle-earth]]. Those who remained built the cities of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] on the shores of [[Falas]] with [[Círdan]] their King. The other Teleri arrive to the [[Undying Lands]] on Eressëa but prefer to live on the island.

Then follows a description of how the Elves lived in [[Valinor]], in their city of [[Eldamar]], the city of [[Tirion]] in the [[Calacirya]] and the haven of [[Alqualondë]] built by the Teleri on the shore of Aman. Then we are told the relationships among the three houses, and the children of the three Kings.
