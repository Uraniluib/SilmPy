The '''Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft e.V.''' (shortened '''DTG''') (German: "German Tolkien Society (incorporated society)") is the German [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] society. 

== History ==

The DTG was founded on [[August 1]], [[1997]] as a literary association. Since [[1998]] the domicile of the DTG is in Cologne. It steadily grew up to its current member count of about 800 people, especially from Germany or German-speaking countries.

== Gatherings ==

The DTG organises a number of Tolkien events:

* ''[[Tolkien Thing]]'' ("Tolkien Moot") - A meeting of the DTG members. (once a year)
* ''Tolkien Tage'' ("Tolkien Days") - A weekend with seminars, lectures, games, performances and other activities for all Tolkien-fans.
* ''Tolkien Seminar'' (since [[2004]]) - Somekind of academic convention, where german Tolkien-experts lecture and then discuss with the other participants a common theme, based on Tolkien's works. (once a year)
* ''Tolkien Stammtisch'' ("Tolkien regulars' table") - A regional event. The meetings ("Stammtische") take place regularly (usually once a month). The ''Tolkien Stammtisch'' is something like a regional representation of the DTG and allows potential members the first contact with the association.

== Publications ==

Two times a year the DTG publishes its association magazine ''Der Flammifer von Westernis'' (including an English Summary). The most important publication is the scientific journal [[Hither Shore (journal)|Hither Shore]] (bilingual).
