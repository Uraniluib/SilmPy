'''''Splintered Light''''' is a scholarly book on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works, written by [[Verlyn Flieger]].
==Synopsis==
In a completely revised version of her 1983 edition, Flieger (English, U. of Maryland, College Park) uses Owen Barfield's linguistic concept of fragmented meaning to assert the centrality of a theme of splintered light in Tolkien's work. Emphasizing the usefulness of Tolkien's The Silmarillion as a guide to his thought, Flieger traces the repeated and spiritual theme of things and people fragmented to become whole again.
