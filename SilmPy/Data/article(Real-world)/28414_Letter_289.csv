==Summary==
Tolkien explained the origin of the word [[Mirkwood]], and that he did not invent it himself, but took it from an [[wikipedia:Myrkviðr|Myrkviðr]], a large forest that was traditionally held as the border between the Goths and the Huns.

Only the beginning and ending of this letter was published in ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien''. The middle paragraph, along with the other two paragraphs, appeared in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' (see [[Letter to Michael George Tolkien (29 July 1966)]]).
