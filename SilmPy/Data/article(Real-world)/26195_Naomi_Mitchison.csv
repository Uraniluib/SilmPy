'''Naomi Mary Margaret Mitchison''' ([[1 November|November 1]], [[1897]] â€“ [[11 January|January 11]], [[1999]]) was a Scottish novelist and poet.

==History==
Mitchison was educated in Oxford, and contributed verse to ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' for 1915 and 1916 (in the former, in company with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s "[[Goblin Feet]]"). Eventually, she became a prolific writer of books and articles, including ''Graeme and the Dragon'' (1954, illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]]) and ''[[To the Chapel Perilous]]'' (1955, which Tolkien disliked).<ref name=RG/>

For many years, Mitchison was a fan of Tolkien's works, and they had a long-time correspondance. She became a proofreader of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[George Allen and Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]] sent her advance proofs of the first two volumes. Of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Mitchison wrote "It is timeless and will go on".<ref>Quoted by D.M.S. in "Recent Readings", in the journal ''English'' 1956, 11, p. 31</ref>

However, later in life she became increasingly critical of Tolkien's works, critizing the "grandiose style" of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' and the lack of a feminine perspective in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and finding ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' simplistic.<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 592-3</ref>
