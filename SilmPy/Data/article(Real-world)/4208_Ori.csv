'''Ori''' was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Ori lived at the Lonely Mountain<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref> until he went to [[Moria]] as part of [[Balin]]'s ill-fated attempt to re-take the ancient mansions of the Dwarves.<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|II5}}</ref>

==History==
Ori's parentage is unknown, although he was a remote kinsman of Thorin and a member of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name="Durin"/>  His birth year is also unknown.  However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor, it was said that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years"<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that after Thorin had been captured, [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>  Since Fíli was born in {{TA|2859}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Ori's birth between 2809 and {{TA|2763|n}}, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.  Ori was a member of the [[House of Durin]] and probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after he began living there following the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Ori was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  He wore a grey hood.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Ori (along with [[Dori]] and [[Nori]]) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Ori and Nori were the second pair of Dwarves to arrive.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

[[File:Joona Kujanen - Last Moments.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Joona Kujanen - ''Last Moments'']]Ori fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria===
In {{TA|2989}}<ref name="TA"/> Ori (and Óin) had followed Balin with a [[Balin's Colony|colony]] of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient mansions of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which were already occupied by the [[Orcs|Goblins]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>  At first the colony did well, but [[Third Age 2994|less than five years later]] Balin was killed, the Orcs returned and took the [[Great Gates|East-gate]], and Óin's group that he took west to the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] was destroyed except for a few. 
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mazarbul page 1.jpg|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Mazarbul]] written by Ori in [[Tengwar]].]]
Ori retreated to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] where [[Balin's Tomb]] was laid.  He wrote the last pages in the [[Book of Mazarbul]] before he and the last few remaining Dwarves perished during a [[Last Stand of Balin's Colony|final stand]].<ref name="Bridge"/> As Ori knew there was no hope to escape, he continued writing in the book, hoping that someone would find it, and would know what happened to them.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #10</ref>

When [[Frodo Baggins]] came to [[Rivendell]] he met [[Glóin]], who delighted in telling the hobbit about the doings of the renewed dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain.  But when Frodo asked about Ori, [[Balin]], and [[Óin]] (also members of Thorin and Company), Glóin's face darkened and he said that he did not know.  In fact, their fate was largely why the Dwarves had come to Rivendell at that time, to seek advice.<ref name="Meetings"/>

===Legacy===
During the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] journeyed through [[Moria]] and discovered the book that contained the records of the expedition.  The last lines were written by Ori, as recognized by [[Gimli]] due to Ori's recognizable large, bold handwriting using [[Tengwar]] (Gimli also said that Ori could write well and speedily).<ref name="Bridge"/>

==Etymology==
Óri is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Violent".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other Versions of Tolkien's Legendarium==
Ori is said to be the cousin of Dori and Nori in Tolkien's 1966 notes, despite the popular belief that he is their brother. It is also confirmed that he wears a grey hood.<ref>{{HH|7iv}}</ref>

It is Ori who chronicles much of the journey through The Wild to the shores of the Long Lake and the slopes of The Lonely Mountain.

:There are two dwarves that have the name Ori. Foreman Ori stands near the Silver Deep Mine in Thorin's Gate.
