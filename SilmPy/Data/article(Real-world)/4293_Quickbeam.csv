'''Quickbeam''', or in [[Sindarin]] '''Bregalad''', was one of the younger [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] belonging to the people of [[Skinbark]]. His name was given because of uncharacteristic hastiness. 

The [[rowans|rowan]]-trees in his keeping (among them [[Carnimírië]], [[Lassemista]], and [[Orofarnë]]) suffered greatly at the hands of [[Saruman]]'s [[Orcs]], so he was the first ent to make his mind up at the [[Entmoot]]. He sheltered, in his [[Ent-houses|home]], the two [[Hobbits|hobbit]]s, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while the other ents made up their minds at the entmoot. He played a great part in the Ents' resulting [[Battle of Isengard|attack]] on [[Isengard]].
==Etymology==
The name ''Quickbeam'' was given to him because he was hasty for an Ent.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> His Sindarin name, ''Bregalad'', means "quick (lively) tree", derived from  *''[[BERÉK|breg]]-'' having to do with "violence, suddenness" and ''[[galadh]]'', "tree".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 82</ref>

Quickbeam and Quicken are actual English names of the "[[Rowans|rowan]]" or "mountain [[Ashes|ash]]". It was not coincidental that "rowan" is mentioned in Quickbeam's song.<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 762</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
