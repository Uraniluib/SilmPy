'''Lars-Terje Lysemose''' (b. [[1974]]) is a Danish journalist, editor and educator. A member of [[The Tolkien Society]] in the early 1990s, he founded what is now known as [[Imladris, Danmarks Tolkienforening]] (then, Danmarks Tolkienforening) together with [[Inge Søbæk]] in 1993.

He also became the editor for ''[[Athelas (journal)|Athelas]]'', the journal of the Society. As the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] were not included in the Danish edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Lysemose published a translation running through several issues of ''Athelas''.

In 1997, Lysemose moved to the United States and left the post as editor for ''Athelas''.
