==Summary==
[[Rhona Beare]] had a number of questions about the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' which Tolkien answered:

* Aragorn's boast that he was of NÃºmenor "unmingled" referred to his paternal line of ancestry.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

* [[Treebeard]] was using ancient Elvish in an Entish fashion in his songs, not Entish sounds.  Tolkien listed the elements of his songs with translations.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>
