'''''The Pitkin Guide to Tolkien''''' is a [[2011]] introduction to the life and works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].
==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|'The Pitkin Guide to Tolkien' evokes the life and works of the great writer by exploring those places where he lived, worked, socialised and visited, in particular in and around Oxford - during which time he wrote the fantasy sagas ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings''.  These books were destined to change the face of English literature in the 20th century and in the 21st century remain ever-popular classics, and subsequent films have introduced a new generation to the works of this author.|<ref>[http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/products/Pitkin-Guide-to-Tolkien.aspx Pitkin Guide to Tolkien] at [http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/ TheHistoryPress.co.uk] (accessed 24 September 2011)</ref>}}
