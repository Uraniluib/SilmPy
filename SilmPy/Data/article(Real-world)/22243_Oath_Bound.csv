'''''Oath Bound''''' is the sixth full length album by [[Summoning]], released in [[2006]]. The songs "Might And Glory" and "Land Of The Dead" both feature a self-sung choir chorus similar to what was used on the ''[[Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame]]'' song "Farewell". To date it is Summoning's longest release, just 21 seconds longer than ''[[Dol Guldur (album)|Dol Guldur]]''. The name Oath Bound was selected as it fits well with ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' theme the album has, in reference to the [[Oath of FÃ«anor]].
