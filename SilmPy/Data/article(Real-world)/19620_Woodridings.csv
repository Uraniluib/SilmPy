'''Woodridings''', or '''19 Lakeside Road''', was a bungalow owned by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It was situated in Branksome, Poole near [[Bournemouth]]. He bought the house in [[1968]], and he and [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]] lived there until her death in [[1972]]. They moved there to escape Tolkien's fame in [[Oxford]] after his retirement.<ref name=TL838>Pieter Collier, 9th July 2008, "[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/838-Own_a_Piece_of_Tolkien_History.php Here is your chance to own a piece of Tolkien history]", [[TolkienLibrary.com]]</ref>

The house was sold some time after September 2007 by the person who bought it from Tolkien<ref name=TL838/> and subsequently demolished to be replaced with two "superb contemporary houses", which at some point were given the names "Luthien House" and "Beren House".<ref>[https://goo.gl/maps/jGrqU Luthien House and Beren House] on [[wikipedia:Google Street View|Google Street View]] as of 19th June 2015</ref>
