'''Bombadil Goes Boating''' is a poem written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and was published in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.<ref>{{AB|Boating}}</ref> It was closely related to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Tom shows that he knows much of the recent events in [[the Shire]] thanks to a figure from [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s childhood:
{{quote|He made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to [[Farmer Maggot]], whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined|The House of Tom Bombadil, The Fellowship of the Ring}}

Tom even travels down the [[Withywindle]] to visit the Farmer and his family, singing and dancing late into the night. There was also a mock-scholarly introduction, in which Tolkien notes that not only did the [[Buckland]] [[hobbits]] compose poetry about Tom Bombadil, "they probably gave him this name (it is Bucklandish in form) to add to his many older ones." But, he writes, "they had as little understanding of his powers as the [[Shire-folk]] had of [[Gandalf]]'s: both were regarded as benevolent persons, mysterious maybe and unpredictable but nonetheless comic."<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>
