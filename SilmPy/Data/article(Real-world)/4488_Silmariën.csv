'''Silmariën''' was the first child of [[Tar-Elendil]], the fourth [[King of Númenor]] and mother of the first [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. 
==History==
Silmariën was the eldest child of King Tar-Elendil and elder sister of Meneldur. However because of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] law of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnatic_primogeniture agnatic primogeniture] that then existed in the Realm, she could not succeed her father as King of Númenor and instead her brother took up the [[Sceptre]] as [[Tar-Meneldur]].<ref name="UTWife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Silmariën wed [[Elatan]] of [[Andúnië]], and in honor of their son [[Valandil (Lord of Andúnië)|Valandil]], her father created the royal title of [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. Also, instead of giving this valuable heirloom to his heir, Tar-Elendil gave her the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref> Silmariën also was given a ''[[mithril]]'' fillet.<ref name=gladden>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>
==Legacy==
Her heirs, coming of the royal line of [[Númenor]]<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>, centuries later they led the [[Faithful]] to [[Middle-earth]] to found the Kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. [[Aragorn]], the hero of the [[War of the Ring]], is her direct descendant through ''many'' generations.

Her fillet would become part of the [[Elendilmir]], a sign of royalty in [[Númenor]] and later the crown of the Kingdom of [[Arnor]].<ref name=gladden/>
== Etymology ==
Silmariën's name is not given a translation, although its etymology is straightforward in [[Quenya]]. It may incorporate ''silma'' "silver, shining white;<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[SIL]]</ref> crystal (white)<ref>{{PE|17}}, p.23</ref>" and obviously ends in the feminine ending ''-rien'', apparently a variant of ''-ien'' (see ''-[[riel]]'').<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|dated=December 25, 2008|website=Arda |accessed=}}</ref> The meaning therefore would be *"Maiden garlanded with shining light"

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Silmariën was definitely the eldest child of Tar-Elendil, and her birthdate is given in [[The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor]] as {{SA|521}}.<ref name="UTKing"/> In the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]], it is given as 548, a date that goes back to the first drafts of that text whose revision was overlooked by Tolkien.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> This error was fixed in later editions of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{App|SA|50}}</ref>
