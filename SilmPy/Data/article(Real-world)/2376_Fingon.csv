{{quote|Of all the children of Finwe he is justly most renowned: for his valour was as a fire and yet as steadfast as the hills of stone; wise he was and skilled in voice and hand; truth and justice he loved and bore good will to all, both Elves and Men, hating Morgoth only; he sought not his own, neither power nor glory, and death was his reward.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', "[[Quenta Silmarillion]]"}}
'''Fingon''' ([[Years of the Trees]] – [[First Age]] {{FA|472|n}}) was a [[Noldor]]in prince, and later [[High King of the Noldor]], noted for his skill in battle and was thus named "the Valiant" by his cousin [[Maedhros]].

Fingon was the eldest son of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Anairë]], older brother of [[Turgon]], [[Aredhel]], and [[Argon]], who ruled the Noldor as High King from {{FA|456}} following the death of his father in single combat with [[Morgoth]]. Fingon led the largest host in the Flight of the Noldor from [[Aman]] to [[Middle-earth]] where he then ruled over [[Dor-lómin]] and [[Hithlum]]. However, Fingon is mostly remembered for his friendship with Maedhros, who he rescued from the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]], and for the manner of his death in battle with the balrog [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. He was succeeded as High King by his brother [[Turgon]] who ruled the Noldor from [[Gondolin]].

==History==
===In Aman===
Fingon was the eldest son of [[Fingolfin]], son of [[King of the Noldor]] [[Finwë]] and his second wife [[Indis]].<ref name="Eldamar">{{S|Eldamar}}</ref> Fingon was born between {{YT|1190|n}}<ref>{{AA|81}}</ref><ref group="note">Birth of Fingolfin.</ref> and {{YT|1300|n}}<ref name="Annals">{{AA|85|note}}</ref><ref group="note">Birth of [[Turgon]].</ref> in the [[Years of the Trees]], and whilst in Aman lived in [[Tirion]], home of the [[Noldor]] in [[Valinor]].<ref name="Eldamar" />

In {{YT|1495}}, [[Morgoth]], with the help of [[Ungoliant]], destroyed the [[Two Trees]], stole the [[Silmarils]] from the fortress of [[Formenos]] and killed Finwë.<ref name="AA">{{AA|107-128}}</ref> In anger, Fingon's uncle [[Fëanor]] made a speech in Tirion and, with [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]], made [[Oath of Fëanor|an oath]] to recover the Silmarils and lead the Noldor in a flight to Beleriand. Most love there was for Fingolfin's people, and although Fingolfin was reluctant to join the flight, he went out of love for Fingon who, with his brother [[Turgon]], strongly supported Fëanor.<ref name="Flight">{{S|Flight}}</ref>

During the flight of the Noldor, Fingon led the largest host and his people supported Fëanor in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|First Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]]. Once the host reached [[Araman]] in {{YT|1496}} there was great debate about how to reach [[Middle-earth]]. Fëanor's people secretly took all the [[Swan-ships]] and passed over the sea to land at [[Drengist]]; [[Maedhros]] - who was friendly with Fingon - wanted to send the ships back first to retrieve "Fingon the valiant" but Fëanor, to Maedhros's reluctance, burnt the ships at [[Losgar]].<ref name="Flight" /> Fingon, with the rest of the Noldor of Fingolfin and his cousin [[Finrod]], had to cross the dangerous grinding ice of [[Helcaraxë]] to much loss of life. They arrived in Middle-earth in {{YT|1500}}, after Fëanor had been killed in the second [[Battles of Beleriand|battle]] of [[Beleriand]], [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]].<ref>{{GA|52}}</ref><ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref>
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Speed now this feathered shaft.jpg|thumb|left|"Speed now this feathered shaft" by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
===Rescue of Maedhros===
In {{FA|1}}, soon after their arrival in [[Middle-earth]], following the rising of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the host of [[Fingolfin]] were attacked in the [[Battle of the Lammoth]]. Although victorious in battle against the [[Orcs]], Fingon's brother [[Argon]] was surrounded and killed.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 362</ref>

There was no great love between the Houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor following the latter's burning of the ships causing the former to cross the Helcaraxë. Fingon resolved to rebuild the relationship between these two great houses of the [[Noldor]], so in {{FA|5}} went on a noble quest to [[Thangorodrim]] to rescue his cousin and friend [[Maedhros]] who had previously been captured by [[Morgoth]]. Travelling alone, and unseen in the darkness, Fingon climbed across the cracks and crevices of Thangorodrim but could not find Maedhros; eventually he took out his harp and sang. Finally he could hear the distant voice of Maedhros singing in answer, but could not climb up to him; Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow, but as Fingon cried to [[Manwë]] to "speed now this feathered shaft", the great [[Eagles|eagle]] [[Thorondor]] swooped down and lifted Fingon up. Fingon could not break Maedhros's chains - being of evil design by [[Morgoth]] - and although Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, Fingon cut Maedhros's hand off at the wrist to free him. Borne back to Hithlum by Thoronodor, Fingon's deed was praised as one of the most mighty amongst the Noldor; the hurt between the two houses was healed, and Maedhros waived the [[High King of the Noldor|High Kingship of the Noldor]] which then passed to Fingolfin.<ref name="Realms" />

[[Fingolfin]]'s people made their home in [[Hithlum]], mostly around [[Lake Mithrim]], and built the fortress of [[Barad Eithel]] to keep watch; in {{FA|7}}, at Maedhros's suggestion, Fëanor's sons move to [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{GA|65-71}}</ref> The region of [[Nevrast]] was taken by Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] (until he moved to [[Gondolin]]), whilst the south-western region of Hithlum, [[Dor-lómin]], was given to Fingon to rule over.<ref name="Realms">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

===In Hithlum===
Following the great victory of the [[Noldor]] in the [[Dagor Aglareb]], the Glorious Battle, Fingon lived in a watchful peace known as the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name="Return"/> In {{FA|155}}, [[Morgoth]] sent a force of along the coast to [[Drengist]] to attack [[Hithlum]] from the west; having been seen by the [[Noldor]], Fingon heavily defeated the Orcs causing Morgoth to realise that orcs alone were no match for the Elves.<ref>{{GA|155}}</ref> Over a hundred years later in {{FA|260}}, the great [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] came forth from [[Angband]] to attack the Elves;<ref name="GA260">{{GA|260}}</ref> although a new breed of [[fire-drakes|fire-drake]], Glaurung was still relatively young and only half-grown. The Elves fled to [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Dorthonion]] as Glaurung defiled the [[Ard-galen]], but Fingon led a troop of archers on horseback to attach Glaurung - he could not withstand their arrows and fled, and for the next 200 years the peoples of [[Beleriand]] enjoyed the [[Long Peace]] and grew prosperous.<ref name="Return" /> In {{FA|416}}, [[Fingolfin]] grants [[Dor-lómin]] to the [[House of Hador]], the third house of the [[Edain]], and Fingon presented [[Hador]] with a [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin|Dragon-helm]] which eventually passed to [[Túrin]].<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 228</ref><ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>

In winter {{FA|455}}, rivers of fire suddenly sprang forth from [[Angband]], turning the Ard-galen into the [[Anfauglith]]; this began the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the Battle of Sudden Flame.<ref name="Ruin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> The dragon Glaurung led armies of [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]] in battle that resulted in the deaths of many Elves and Men due to the fire and smoke, or being slain; the remaining forces of the Noldor were scattered following this heavy defeat. Perceiving the ruin of the Noldor, Fingon's father Fingolfin challenged Morgoth to single combat; Fingolfin fought valiantly and although he died in the battle, Morgoth himself was wounded and never again fought in single combat. Fingon became [[High King of the Noldor]].<ref name="Ruin" /><ref name="Realms" />

Seven years later, in {{FA|462}}, Morgoth sent a force of Orcs to attack Fingon's people in Hithlum. Galdor, son of Hador, died defending [[Eithel Sirion]] and his son [[Húrin]] took up the [[Lords of Dor-lómin|lordship of Dor-lómin]] and served Fingon thereafter; but to the west battle took place in Hithlum and Fingon would have succumbed had it not been for a force of [[Falathrim]] elves under the command of [[Círdan]] who sailed up the Firth of [[Drengist]] and helped defeat the Orcs.<ref name="Ruin" />

===Nirnaeth Arnoediad===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fingon and Gothmog.jpg|thumb|right|"Fingon and Gothmog" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Following the success of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Maedhros]] saw that Morgoth was not unassailable and was emboldened to form the [[Union of Maedhros]] of Elves, Men and [[Dwarves]]. Maedhros would attack from the east, and Fingon from the west, and they planned to trap Morgoth between the two armies.<ref name="Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> Unlooked for, Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] unleashed a force of ten thousand Elves from [[Gondolin]]; on seeing this, Fingon cried:

{{blockquote|'Utúlie'n aurë! Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatári, utúlie'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: 'Auta i lómë! The night is passing!'|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of the Fifth Battle]]"}}

However, Maedhros's army had been delayed following the betrayal of [[Uldor]]. [[Morgoth]] therefore sent his Orcs swiftly over the Anfauglith to taunt Fingon and draw out his forces; they held firm until the Orcs brought forth [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]] and cut off his legs, arms and head before them. Seeing this was his brother [[Gwindor]] who, with Fingon, led the charge; they reached the doors of Angband but all the [[Elves of Nargothrond]] were slain save Gwindow, who was taken captive.<ref name="Fifth" />

On the fourth day, Fingon retreated and met his brother Turgon on the plains of Anfauglith; some hours later the banners of [[Maedhros]] appeared on the battlefield and the Elves were heartened, believing victory was in their grasp. However, Morgoth then unleashed [[wolves]], dragons and balrogs led by [[Glaurung]] who separated the hosts of Fingon and Turgon from Maedhros. This battle, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Unnumbered Tears, was the most grievous for the Elves. Fingon was surrounded with a host of Men from [[Dor-lómin]] led by [[Húrin]]. Eventually, being pushed back, Fingon fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], lord of [[Balrogs]] in battle, but was killed by Gothmog's black axe after another balrog bound him with a whip. This brought an end to Fingon's realm in [[Hithlum]], and his brother Turgon became High King of the Noldor,<ref name="Fifth" /> whilst Húrin was captured and tortured personally by Morgoth.<ref name="Narn" />

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Fingon.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Fingon'' includes the element ''fin'' meaning "hair".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''fin-''</ref> The name is the [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] version of his [[Quenya]] [[father-name]], '''''Findekáno''''' which consists of ''[[findë]]'' "hair" and ''[[káno]]'' "commander", "ruler", "chieftain";<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 345</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 113</ref><ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref> however, in the original "[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]" it was suggested ''find'' meant "skill".<ref>{{LR|Etym}}, entry ''PHIN-''</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' Fingon was the father of [[Gil-galad]], which was a brief idea that Tolkien had, but this inclusion was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] who admitted it would have been better had his parentage remained obscure and that Gil-galad being the son of [[Orodreth]] was Tolkien's "last word on the subject".<ref>{{WJ|Ruin}}, pp. 242-3</ref><ref>{{PM|Gilgalad}}, passim</ref> 

[[Christopher Tolkien]] observed that in the very earliest versions of the legendarium, there is no mention of Fingon (or Fingolfin, Finarfin or [[Finrod]])<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, p. 173</ref><ref>{{LT1|Xn}}, p. 243</ref> However, when he first appears in "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]" in the 1920s he is named '''''Finweg'''''<ref>{{LB|1}}, p. 5</ref> (and on one occasion ''Fingweg''),<ref>{{LB|1e}}, 102</ref> a name he retains in the "[[The Quenta]]" of the early 1930s even though his story closely matches that of the published ''Silmarillion''. A more significant difference is that originally Fingon spoke against [[Fëanor]] at [[Tirion]],<ref>{{MR|Annals}}, pp. 121, 125</ref> whilst in the later 1951 version of ''Quenta Silmarllion'', Fingon and [[Turgon]] did not take part in the Kinslaying at [[Alqualondë]].<ref>{{MR|P3I7}}, p. 196</ref>

Fingon is renamed from Finweg the 1930s around the time of the [[Annals of Beleriand]], <ref>{{SM|7Ic}}, p. 316</ref> and was firmly Fingon by the time [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] reworked the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] in 1937-8;<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, passim</ref> in an [[Old English]] version of the "[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]", Fingon's name is given as '''''Finbrand'''''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 213</ref>
