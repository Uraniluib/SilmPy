The '''Runic alphabet''' was a system of writing based on angular shapes that could easily be carved into wood or stone. It originated and was used mainly in Northern Europe, by the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Old Norse|Norse tribes]]. One theory says that Runes evolved from Etruscan writing, however other quasi-runic scripts in other parts of the world ([[wikipedia:Rovásírás|Rovásírás]] and [[wikipedia:Orkhon script|Orkhon Script]]) also exist.

==Tolkien and Runes==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] decided that his [[races|people]]s of [[Arda]] would also use a similar script, and "Runes" are mentioned in his narratives.

In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Tolkien used [[Old English]] runes, or [[wikipedia:Futhorc|Futhorc]], to display the writing of the [[Dwarves]] on the [[Thrór's Map]]; his Dwarves however were based mainly on Norse culture and [[Khuzdul|their language]] is influenced of Semitic languages.<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul]", ''[[Ardalambion]]''</ref> The texts of course are modern English, and display the use of [[Westron]] of [[Third Age]].

The foreword of ''The Hobbit'' (50th anniversary edition and later) explains the usage of the Old English runes and help the reader read the Map (although the translations are also revealed in the end of Chapter 3, ''[[A Short Rest]]'')

Eventually Tolkien elaborated on a totally original runic writing system while writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Although most of the letters between historical runes and Tolkien's "cirth" are identical, they do not share the same values, since the Cirth follow the phonetic principles of the [[Tengwar]].

In the history of [[Arda]], a runic script called [[Cirth]] was invented by [[Daeron]] of [[Doriath]] to represent [[Sindarin]] words. Runes came to be used widely by races other than the [[Elves]], and especially by the [[Dwarves]].
