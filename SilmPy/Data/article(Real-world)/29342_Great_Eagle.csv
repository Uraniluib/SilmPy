The '''Great Eagle''' was the [[Lord of the Eagles]] in the [[Third Age]] and perhaps a descendant of [[Thorondor]].{{fact}}

He resided in the eyrie of the [[Misty Mountains]] with 15 chieftains, and remembered helping [[Dwarves]] in his service.

Once he suffered from a poisoned wound, and was healed by [[Gandalf]] and thenceforth they became friends. 

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], they saved [[Thorin and Company]] as they flew from the [[Goblin-town]] and brought them to the eyrie;<ref>{{H|6}}</ref> later they played a crucial role in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] ({{TA|2941}}).<ref>{{H|17}}</ref> After this he became [[King of All Birds]] and wore a golden crown.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

==Background==
It is often thought that the Great Eagle is the same individual as [[Gwaihir]]. Among several points which separate the two, the Great Eagle is mentioned to wear a crown after ''[[The Hobbit]]'' but no crown is mentioned with Gwaihir in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Furthermore, Gandalf states that he was carried by Gwaihir three times, including following the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref name="RKVI4">{{RK|VI4}}</ref> whereas the number would be at least five if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagles were one and the same.
