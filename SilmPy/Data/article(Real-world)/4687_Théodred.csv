'''Théodred''' ({{TA|2978}}-{{TA|3019|n}}) was the only son and heir of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]] who died in battle at the [[Fords of Isen]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Théodred was born to King [[Théoden]] and [[Elfhild]], who died in childbirth. Because of his state as prince of Rohan, Théodred also held the title of [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]]. 

While [[Gríma]] gained more influence on the King, he considered Théodred and [[Éomer]] his chief opponents, and tried to bring the two cousins into discredit with Théoden. But their loyalty remained steadfast even in his apparent dotage; Gríma therefore tried to play them one against the other in the mind of Théoden, representing Éomer as ever eager to increase his authority, in the expense of Théodred .

In the beginning of {{TA|3019|n}}, due to the threat of invasion by the forces of the wizard [[Saruman]], Théodred established himself at [[Helm's Deep]] to command the military strength of the [[Westfold]]. When actual war began Théodred added to the Muster of Westfold by summoning the [[Muster of Edoras]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>

Meanwhile Saruman planned to have the Prince killed. He sent forces against Rohan on [[February 25]], {{TA|3019}} with explicit orders to kill the Second Marshal at all costs. 

Théodred was warned by his scouts of a mustering of troops at the [[Gate of Isengard]] and he reinforced the approaches. He passed over the [[Isen]] with the main strength of his cavalry to overthrow Saruman's apparent army before it was fully prepared. He scattered the vanguard, but then discovered the main host prepared for assault and ordered a retreat while the rearguard under [[Grimbold]] had to turn and drive back their pursuers.

Retreating, he appointed Grimbold in command of the western bank garrison while himself attempted to man the eyot in the midst of the river. Then a van came and with unexpected speed soon took control of the eastern end of the fords; the fiercest of Saruman's warriors and [[Orc-men]] abandoned the rest of the battle and directed their full might around the Prince. As Grimbold came to his defense, Théodred was hewn down by a great orc-man, whom Grimbold slew.

[[Elfhelm]] arrived to his support and they lifted the body. Théodred still breathed, only long enough to speak his last words.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> The news of Théodred's death caused [[Erkenbrand]] of [[Westfold]] to assume command of the [[West-mark]]. With no descendants or siblings, this made his cousin, [[Éomer]], heir to the throne of Rohan.

== Etymology ==
Théodred's name is probably taken from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ''þēod'' ("folk", "people", "nation") and ''rǣd'' ("counsel").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 403</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Théodred is portrayed younger than he was in the book. His death is a major event early in the movie, whereas, in the book, it has all happened by the time the [[Three Hunters]] come to Rohan. He is brought heavily wounded albeit barely alive to Edoras and tended by [[Éowyn]] before dying. His burial is shown in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|extended edition]]. Théodred was played by [[Paris Howe Strewe]].
