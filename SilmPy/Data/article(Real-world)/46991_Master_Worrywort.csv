'''Master Worrywort''' is a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]  of [[the Shire]] who appears in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' trilogy]]. He is played by [[Timothy Bartlett]].

==History==
In the ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', he inquires where [[Bilbo Baggins]] is off to as he's leaving for the [[Quest of Erebor]]. In the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the film, Worrywort also appears in a prior scene selling tubers near the market at the [[Green Dragon]] Inn when he encounters Bilbo, who had just encountered [[Gandalf]] and declined the [[Wizards|Wizard's]] proposal of going on an adventure. Bilbo asks him if he's seen a Wizard around, and Worrywort replies he hadn't. Bilbo immediately runs away after spotting what he thinks is Gandalf's hat.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''</ref>

In ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', Worrywort is the first to acknowledge Bilbo upon his return to the Shire. He explains to Bilbo that because he had been gone for so long, he had been presumed dead, and all of his possessions were being auctioned off (one of which he was carrying back home with him).<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''</ref>
