'''Eithne Patricia Ní Bhraonáin''' ([[17 May|May 17]], [[1961]]), better known by her stage name '''Enya''', is an Irish singer. 

==History==
Enya was born in [[wikipedia:Gweedore|Gaoth Dobhair]] in Ireland, the sixth of nine children. She came from a musical background, and joined the band of some of her siblings and two of her uncles, [[wikipedia:Clannad|Clannad]], to play keyboards. After a few years, she left together with their manager Nicky Ryan, and pursued a solo-career. Enya, who was, like [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], a devout catholic, included an instrumental song ''[[Lothlórien (Enya song)|Lothlórien]]'' on her third album, ''Shepherd Moons''. Her music style became an iconic Celtic and Irish inspiration for several films and artists; the music of ''[[wikipedia:Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' was heavily inspired by her music. 

She performed vocals on two tracks of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', which she also composed together with Roma Ryan. ''[[Aníron]]'' was the love-theme for [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]], and the Academy Award-nominated ''[[May It Be]]'' was included in the closing credits. Following her introduction to [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], Roma Ryan created her own language, [[wikipedia:Loxian|Loxian]].
