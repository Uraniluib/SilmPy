'''Fate and Free Will''' is the title given to a text written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] sometime after January [[1968]]. The fragment was edited by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and published in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 6]]'' (2009, pp.183-188).

The essay (or rather, notes) consists of a philosophical discussion of [[Eldar|Eldarin]] thoughts on the nature and relations of fate, free will and the created world. These were presented in the context of a linguistic discussion of Elvish phonology (of the two [[Quenya]] words ''[[ambar]]'' 'world' and ''[[Umbar (word)|umbar]]'' 'fate').
