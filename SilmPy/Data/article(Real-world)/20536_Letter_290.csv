==Summary==
[[Michael Tolkien (b. 1943)|Michael George]], Tolkien's grandson, was a graduate student in English literature at the [[University of Oxford]], and had apparently written to his grandfather to discuss his work. The young Tolkien had shown a growing view of [[Wikipedia:Scientific Method|"research"]] as applied to modern literature. The elder Tolkien stated that he disliked the growing influence of Science on Literature, or Arts in general, just to make it look better. 

J.R.R. Tolkien then told of a talk he was supposed to give [[26 October|the preceding wednesday]]. It was not much of a talk, instead, Tolkien read ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' to a crowd of about 800 people.
