'''Théoden''' ([[Third Age]] 2948 – March 15, 3019, aged 71 years) was the seventeenth [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]], ruling for 39 years, from {{TA|2980}} until his death. He was the last of the Second Line.<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==History==

===Early Life===

Théoden was the only son of [[Thengel]], and became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2980}}. Théoden spoke [[Sindarin]] and [[Westron]] rather than [[Rohirric]], for he had been born in [[Gondor]] and spent his youth there.

Théoden loved his sister [[Théodwyn]] most of all.  After she and her husband both died he adopted her children [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]] as his own.  He had a son, [[Théodred]], whose mother [[Elfhild]] died in childbirth.<ref name="Mark"/>

In {{TA|3014}} Théoden's health began to fail.  This may have been due to natural causes (he was sixty-six) or it may have been induced or increased by subtle poisons administered by [[Gríma]].  Gríma (or ''Wormtongue'' as most others in the [[Riddermark|Mark]] called him), was secretly in the employ of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
As the war approached Théoden was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma.  In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands completely, and Gríma became increasingly powerful. Rohan was troubled again by [[Orcs]] and [[Dunlendings]], who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from [[Isengard]].  On Gríma's orders Éomer had been arrested and imprisoned after Éomer's foray to destroy the Orcs that had crossed Rohan.<ref name="Hall">{{TT|III6}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]] appeared before him, the [[Wizards|Wizard]] healed the king.  He then restored his nephew, took up his [[Herugrim|sword]], and led the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]] to the [[Fords of Isen]],where his only son, Théodred, had only recently been slain by Saruman's forces during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. This resulted in Théoden naming Éomer, his nephew, his heir.

On their way, they received news that the border was lost and he retreated into [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle at Helm's Deep]]. After this he became known as '''Théoden Ednew''', the Renewed,<ref name="Mark"/> because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.

After the battle he visited [[Isengard]] where he witnessed as [[Gandalf]] deposed Saruman from [[Wizards|their order]]. On their way back to Rohan, they stopped by the [[Helm's Deep]], where he noticed that the lonely [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of their company, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] felt out of place, and offered to ride with him for the rest of the journey. The hobbit was delighted, as he felt useless among the Riders and offered Théoden his sword in service of Rohan.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

[[Aragorn]] left the Rohirrim's company for [[Dunharrow]], and Théoden and the Riders took a safer path to Edoras. Near the outer hills of Rohan, Théoden dismissed Éomer's urge not to go to the war, and with the remaining Riders he rode to the Hold at Dunharrow, where his people took shelter.<ref name=muster>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

===Fulfilling the Oath of Eorl===
[[File:Paula DiSante - The Red Arrow.JPG|thumb|[[Paula DiSante]] - ''The Red Arrow'']]
After reuniting with Éowyn and while resting, a [[Gondorian]] named [[Hirgon]] entered his tent, bringing the [[Red Arrow]] from [[Denethor]] II. Théoden responded to him that 6000 Riders would reach [[Minas Tirith]] in the week. Indeed they set off the next morning ([[the Dawnless Day]]); before leaving he ordered his squire, Meriadoc, to stay behind at Edoras.<ref name=muster/>

On their way to Minas Tirith, Théoden's forces were alerted to a host of Orcs upon the road from the city moving towards them. A leader of the [[Woses]], [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], offered to lead the Rohirrim by secret paths through the [[Drúadan Forest]] so they could avoid the Orcs. Taking the forgotten road down [[Stonewain Valley]] the riders of Rohan were able to come to the [[Pelennor Fields]] undetected.

To his dismay, they found Hirgon dead and understood that the Gondorians were unaware of their arrival; Minas Tirith [[Siege of Gondor|was being destroyed]]. Théoden was reinvigorated by a sudden great flash of light from the city. He ordered to charge as [[the Darkness]] was fading. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In that battle he challenged the [[Black Serpent]] of the [[Haradrim]], and slew him and his standard-bearer.  <ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Eowyn against Witch-king'']]
The [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] attacked him, and he was mortally wounded when his horse [[Snowmane]] fell upon him after being frightened by the Ringwraith's [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]]. 

He was immediately avenged by Éowyn and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], both of whom had ridden to war in secret.  He claimed to Merry at his death on the field that he was satisfied, for he had felled the Black Serpent.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The body of Théoden the Renowned remained in the [[Hallows]] of Minas Tirith<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> while [[Snowmane]] was buried where they fell. 

His nephew Éomer succeeded him as King of Rohan. In [[July]] he returned to Minas Tirith and brought Théoden's body back to [[Edoras]]. On [[10 August]] the funeral of Théoden took place. [[Gléowine]] composed a poem for him and other Kings of the line of [[Eorl]].<ref name=partings/>

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:þeoden|þeoden]]'', means "lord, king", and contains the element ''þeod'' "people" (''[[éothéod]]'' "horse-people"). It is related to the Old Norse word ''þjóðann'', meaning "Leader of the People" (i.e. "King").{{fact}}

In Tolkien's fictional etymology, the name ''Théoden'' is an Old English translation of the original [[Rohirric]] ''Tûrac'', an old word for King.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

==Other versions==
In one of Tolkien's early drafts, Théoden also had a daughter by the name of [[Idis]], but she was eventually removed when her character was eclipsed by that of Éowyn.

'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Valentine Dyall]] voiced the part of Théoden.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The voice of Théoden was provided by [[Philip Stone]]. 

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Erik Bauersfeld]] provided the voice of Théoden.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Théoden is voiced by [[Don Messick]], though he speaks very little. His death is narrated by [[John Huston]] as Gandalf.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
Theoden played by [[Jack May]] appears much earlier in the narrative than in the book, allowing Gandalf to borrow a horse on his escape from Isengard. 

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:This film deviates from Tolkien's story by having Théoden (played by [[Bernard Hill]]) actually possessed by Saruman rather than simply deceived by Gríma. He then goes to [[Helm's Deep]] to take his people to safety rather than to make a stand against the enemy. 

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Théoden at first refuses to come to the aid of Gondor saying that Gondor did not come to the aid of Rohan at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. His death is placed after the coming of the [[Haradrim]], and is depicted differently; he is not crushed by [[Snowmane]], but wounded by the [[Fell beasts|fell beast]]. In general, his personality is changed from a "kindly old man" to that of a callous and somewhat obstinate character, though he has several tender moments at the grave of his son and near Éowyn.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Théoden is a hero in the Rohan faction. He is voiced by [[Phil Proctor]].

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Théoden is a hero in the Men faction. He is voiced by [[Phil Proctor]].

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:Théoden is voiced by [[Brian George]].
