'''Dorlas''' was a [[Man]] of the [[Haladin]] in the [[First Age]].
==History==
Dorlas was a man of [[Brethil]] and his son was [[Avranc]]. 

He probably witnessed when an [[Orc]]-host held [[Elves of Nargothrond]] captives, and the Haladin wayled them at the [[Crossings of Teiglin]] to rescue them. However in reaction the Orcs slew their prisoners and pinned [[Finduilas]] with a spear on a tree. 

Later he and his woodmen were surrounded by [[Orcs]]. When [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] was in search of Finduilas he came upon them and rescued them, but Dorlas told him of Finduilas' death.  Dorlas and his men then brought Túrin where the woodmen buried Finduilas, the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], and Túrin collapsed in grief.  Dorlas then had Túrin carried to their stockade upon [[Amon Obel]].

Later, when [[Glaurung]] sent orcs to attack the woodmen, Túrin did nothing for he had promised his wife [[Níniel]] not to fight unless their homes were assailed.  Dorlas upbraided Túrin for his inactivity; Túrin then led a company of the Men of Brethil who defeated the orcs.  This action let Glaurung know where Túrin lived.  Glaurung then came to Brethil and Túrin called for volunteers to go fight the dragon.  When only Dorlas stepped forward he upbraided his people.

However, when Túrin, [[Hunthor]], and Dorlas came to the ravines of [[Taeglin]], Dorlas was overwhelmed with fear.  Dorlas hid in the forest, but [[Brandir]], the ruler of the people of Haleth at that time, found him and, after a killing stroke from Dorlas, parried and slew him .<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
