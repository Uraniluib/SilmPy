'''Gléowine''' was a [[Minstrels|minstrel]] of the [[Kings of Rohan|King's House]] of [[Rohan]] in the late [[Third Age]].

==History==
Gléowine composed an immortalizing song about [[Théoden]] and his ancestors after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. It was said that he never composed another song afterwards. Sadly, only the last stanza survived:<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> 

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.
</poem>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
