'''''The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug''''' is the second of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film trilogy]] based on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[1937]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It was released on [[13 December]] [[2013]] in North America. It was preceded by ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' in [[2012]] and followed by ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' in [[2014]].

==Synopsis==
{{Blockquote|“The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug” continues the adventure of the title character [[Bilbo Baggins]] as he journeys with the Wizard [[Gandalf]] and thirteen Dwarves, led by [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]], on an epic quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the lost Dwarf Kingdom of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

''Having survived the beginning of their unexpected journey, the Company continues East, encountering along the way the skin-changer [[Beorn]] and a swarm of giant Spiders in the treacherous forest of [[Mirkwood]]. After escaping capture by the dangerous [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]], the Dwarves journey to Lake-town, and finally to the Lonely Mountain itself, where they must face the greatest danger of all — a creature more terrifying than any other; one which will test not only the depth of their courage but the limits of their friendship and the wisdom of the journey itself — the Dragon [[Smaug]].''|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/10/17/80789-warner-bros-full-synopsis-for-the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-provides-some-plot-hints/|articlename=Warner Bros. full synopsis for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug provides some plot hints?|dated=17-October-2013|website=TORN|accessed=17-October-2013}}</ref>}}

==Plot==
At [[the Prancing Pony]] Inn in [[Bree]], [[Gandalf]] the Grey warns [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] that someone is trying to have him killed. He persuades Thorin to obtain the [[Arkenstone]] to unite the [[Dwarves]], and suggests that a stealthy burglar may be needed to steal the jewel back from [[Smaug]].
 
Twelve months later, Thorin and his [[Thorin and Company|Company]] are being pursued by [[Azog]] and his [[Orcs|Orc]] party down the [[Carrock]] following the events of the previous film. After [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] informs the group that a [[Bears|bear]] is also tracking them, Gandalf ushers them along to the home of a [[Skin-changers|skin-changer]]. Upon their arrival, they are attacked by the same bear; Gandalf reveals that it is the [[Beorn's Hall|home]] of [[Beorn]] and that he may be able to aid them in their journey. That night, Azog is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], and instructs his son [[Bolg]] to take over the hunt for Thorin. The next day, Beorn loans his [[horses]] to the company so they can reach [[Mirkwood]] and hinder the pursuing Orcs. Upon arrival at the forest border, Gandalf discovers [[Black Speech]] graffiti imprinted on an old ruin, coinciding with a telepathic message from [[Galadriel]] imploring him to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazgûl]] (at an [[High Fells of Rhudaur|unnamed location]]). 
Without giving any reason for his sudden departure, Gandalf advises the Company to follow the [[Elves|Elven]] path though Mirkwood, and to wait for him before entering the [[Lonely Mountain]]. But upon losing their way in the forest, the Dwarves are captured by giant [[spiders]]. Bilbo, with the help of his new [[The One Ring|Ring]], manages to free them from the webs and names his sword [[Sting]]. However, while fighting the attacking spiders, Bilbo drops the Ring, and he begins to learn of the corruption it has on him after brutally killing a crab-like spider to retrieve it.

The Dwarves are captured by the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]], including [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]], a captain of the guard. They are to the Elven-king [[Thranduil]]'s [[Elvenking's Halls|kingdom]], and are locked up. During their captivity, a romantic subplot develops between Tauriel and [[Kíli]]. 
While the others are imprisoned, Thorin is given audience with Thranduil, but he refuses Thranduil's aid and is imprisoned as well. Under the cloak of the Ring, Bilbo helps the Dwarves to escape by using empty wine barrels, which are sent floating down the river. Along the way, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, while the Elves pursue the Dwarves to cease their escape. In the ensuing chaos, Kíli is wounded by a Morgul arrow. Legolas and Tauriel are forced to halt their pursuit of the Dwarves in order to end the Orc onslaught. One [[Narzug|captive]] is imprisoned and questioned by Thranduil. When Thranduil learns that "The One" has returned, he decides to seal off his kingdom to protect it from the impending evil. However, Tauriel leaves to save Kíli, whom she learns has been poisoned by Bolg's arrow, and Legolas accompanies her.

Subsequently, the Company meets a man named [[Bard]], and they bribe him to smuggle them into [[Lake-town]], where the descendants of [[Dale]] made their home, and where the [[Master of Lake-town|Master]] of the town rules with an iron fist. The group attempts to steal weapons before being captured and in the process learn that Bard is a descendant of Dale's ruler, [[Girion]], who died attempting to kill Smaug with [[Black Arrow]]s. After Thorin convinces the townfolk and Master that they will share the riches of the recaptured Mountain, the adventurers receive a grand send-off the next morning. The injured Kíli is ordered to stay behind until he gets his strength back; [[Óin]], [[Fíli]] and [[Bofur]] also remain to tend him in Bard's house.

As the events of Thorin's Company occurs, Gandalf reaches the remote tomb of the Nazgûl and found that they have been revived. He is joined by [[Radagast]] the Brown, and it is revealed that the Necromancer cannot be a mere human, as the Nazgûl answer only to one [[Sauron|master]]. Returning to Mirkwood, while sending Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery, Gandalf enters the Orc- and [[Wargs|Warg]]-infested Dol Guldur, and is attacked by Azog. While attempting to escape, the Necromancer appears, and, following a duel between the two, Gandalf is captured. With his worst fears realized – that the Necromancer is indeed [[Sauron]] – Gandalf watches in horror as the Orc army marches toward the Lonely Mountain.

Once at the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo deciphers the [[Thrór's Map|map]]'s cryptic clue and uses moonlight to find the hidden keyhole that opens the [[Back Door|secret door]] into the mountain. [[Balin]] then explains Bilbo's real purpose and sends him down to the treasury to locate the Arkenstone. Unfortunately, Bilbo's searching quickly awakens Smaug, who initially finds the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] amusing, but swiftly tires of him and intends to kill him. In Lake-town, Bard hears the rumbling caused by Smaug's awakening and attempts to affix the last Black Arrow to the town's launcher, but is arrested. Óin, Fíli, Bofur, and Bard's daughters, [[Sigrid]] and [[Tilda]], are attacked by Bolg's hunting party before Legolas and Tauriel drive them off, with the latter remaining behind to tend to Kíli. Then, in a dream-like state after his medication, Kíli admits his love for Tauriel. After convincing Thorin that they must help Bilbo, the Dwarves enter the Mountain and find themselves and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] being hunted by Smaug. Tricking the [[Fire-drakes|fire-breathing]] Smaug into rekindling the forges, they attempt to kill the dragon by drowning him in a flood of molten gold. However, Smaug survives, and stumbles out of the mountain determined to make the people of Lake-town suffer for giving aid to the Dwarves, leaving Bilbo horrified at the turn of events.

==Deviations from the source material==
''The Hobbbit: The Desolation of Smaug'' covers the seventh through twelfth chapters of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' with a few elements added from the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. While it generally follows the story, a number of liberties were still taken:

*[[Thorin]]'s encounter with [[Gandalf]] at [[the Prancing Pony]], in which the [[Wizards|Wizard]] urges him to take back [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], was not a chance meeting as it was in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings, but rather orchestrated by Gandalf himself.
*The extended prologue shows a survey of the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], which had already been seen in the previous film ''An Unexpected Journey'', where it differed from the books insofar that [[Thrór]]'s death didn't occur during the Battle, but before, initiating the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|War]]. In this extended prologue the film departs further from the books because Thorin can't find his father [[Thráin|Thráin II]] after the Battle, whereas Tolkien wrote that Thráin did not disappear afterwards but travelled to the [[Ered Luin]] and lived there together with Thorin for 39 years; only then Thráin set out to revisit Erebor and was captured.
*Thorin says: "I received word that my Father had been seen wandering the wilds near [[Dunland]]. I went looking, and found no sign of him," and to Gandalf "My father came to see you before he went missing." There are no hints of this in the books, where Gandalf didn't encounter [[Thráin]] until he found him in [[Dol Guldur]].
*Gandalf urges Thorin to unite the armies of the [[Dwarves]] to retake Erebor, but in the books from the beginning he planned to retake the Mountain in secret.
*Since the film's antagonist, [[Azog]], and the pursuit of the [[Orcs]] are invented for the film, in the books, Gandalf doesn't show Thorin a message in [[Black Speech]] about a bounty on Thorin's head, and Gandalf doesn't meet strangers who mistook him for a "vagabond." The two strange peoples in the Inn are inspired by [[Bill Ferny]] and the [[Squint-eyed Southerner]], who filled a similar role in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.
*In Tolkien's writings, there is no "oath" sworn by the seven Dwarf families to the one who wields the [[Arkenstone]].
*As told in ''[[The Quest of Erebor]]'', the term "Burglar" (or "Master Burglar") emerged by chance, but, in the film, Gandalf meant to use it in the particular context in which [[Thorin and Company]] see [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] later on.
*The meeting in [[Bree]] happened on [[15 March]] {{TA|2941}}, and the Company comes to [[Beorn]] in late summer, but the film says that 12 months are in between the prologue and the Company's arrival at Beorn's.
*The Dwarves see Beorn first in his [[bears|bear]] form and flee from him into his [[Beorn's Hall|house]], and barricade the front door. In the book, they come as several couples while Gandalf is telling Beorn their story (which doesn't occur until the next morning in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the film).
*In the book, Gandalf already knows that he must leave the Company to deal with the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], but in the film he doesn't decide to leave until noticing a banner with a red eye on a tree at the entrance of [[Mirkwood]]. He doesn't tell the Dwarves as to where he's leaving and why.
*Bilbo wants to tell Gandalf of [[the One Ring]]. In the books, he has no such tendencies.
*In the Extended Edition of the film, Beorn says there is an alliance between the Orcs of [[Moria]] and the Necromancer in [[Dol Guldur]], and, throughout the film, Azog and his son [[Bolg]]'s alliance with the Necromancer is shown. Azog doesn't appear in any way in the books after his death at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], and his son also only appears at the end at the [[Battle of Five Armies]], while Sauron has nothing to do with Thorin's Company and the Erebor [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] at all (except for Gandalf's fear that [[Smaug]] could align with Sauron).
*The corruption of the Ring concerning Bilbo is displayed clearer in the film; he is shown playing with it at night and very aggressevily killing a [[Spiders|spider]]-like creature that stands between him and the Ring.
*As often in the trilogy, it isn't made clear how long the journey lasts; in the book, the Company wanders through Mirkwood for almost one month, almost starving, and suffering heavily from the immense darkness in the forest -- although in the film there is much more light, the Company's confusion and growing insanity is much stronger. 
*Instead of crossing Mirkwood's [[Enchanted River]] by boat, Bilbo and the Dwarves climb on vines that extend across the river, and there is no deer leaping over it (Thorin sees a stag after crossing and shoots an arrow at it, at which point it runs away). This scene is only seen in the Extended Edition of the film.
*When Bilbo climbs the treetops in Mirkwood, he is able to see the edge of the forest, the Long Lake and the Lonely Mountain, but in the book the Company happens to be in a valley, which is why he cannot peer over the surrounding treetops, therefore believing they were still deep in the forest.
*The [[Elves]] fight the [[spiders]] and capture the Dwarves afterward.
*In the book, Thorin was captured separately before the rest of the Company and kept captive in his own room (where he was treated and fed well), though he wouldn't reveal his purpose for being in Mirkwood. The other Dwarves weren't told he was there. In the film, they all get captured together after the Elves' fight with the spiders.
*[[Thranduil]] guesses the purpose of the Company's mission was to retake Erebor, and tries to make a deal with Thorin. In the book, he is oblivious to this and only wants to know why they wandered through the forest.
*Thranduil at first allowed the other Dwarves to move about freely within his halls, but he finally locked them up, each to his own cell, because they were being obnoxious and insulting in the book. In the film, they are immediately locked up.
*Neither [[Legolas]] nor [[Tauriel]] appear in the book. The latter character is a creation of the filmmakers.
*The Elven-feasts and fires are only alluded to in a conversation between [[Kíli]] and Tauriel.
*Bilbo hides the Dwarves in the barrels (with no tops) while the chief guard and [[Galion]] the butler were asleep, and he launches them into the [[Forest River|river]] himself. In the book, the Elves themselves later pushed the barrels (which they thought were empty; they were also covered with lids) through the trapdoor and opened the portcullis at the water-gate to let the barrels into the river.
*In the book, the portcullis was a grate lowered down across the opening (the water-gate) that let the stream from the cave flow out into the river. In the film, the portcullis was a side-swinging type, and it wouldn't have kept anybody inside the cave because it was outside on the river.
*There is a pursuit by the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] after the Dwarves' escape from the [[Elvenking's Halls]] (whereas the Elves did not yet know the Dwarves had escaped in the book), and the pack of Orcs who were pursuing the Company in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|previous film]] catch up and attack as the barrels float down the river. The Elves then counterattack the Orcs.
*Kíli is struck with a Morgul arrow by Bolg during the barrel escape when trying to open the water-gate, and it slowly saps his strength through the rest of the film. He is ultimately healed by Tauriel (who uses [[athelas]] to do so) in [[Lake-town]], where his health had become critical. Throughout the film, an emotional relationship forms between both. No such incidents occur in Tolkien's works.
*There is an interrogation of a [[Narzug|captured Orc]] who reveals to Thranduil and Legolas that there is a "shadow" and that his master "serves the One", making Thranduil decide to barricade his kingdom, against the will of Tauriel.
*In the book, [[Raft-elves]] intercepted the barrels and loaded them into a raft they steered down the river to the [[Long Lake]], where [[Men]] in boats pulled it to Lake-town with the undiscovered Dwarves still inside and Bilbo (still wearing his Ring) riding along. In the film, [[Bard]] is introduced in their place much earlier than in the book (where he does not appear before the attack of [[Smaug]] as one of the town's bowmen) where he is a bargeman and meets the Dwarves on the [[River Running|river]]. [[Balin]] convinces him to smuggle the Company into Lake-town in the barrels (where they are nearly discovered), to hide them in his house, and to give them weapons. On the way to Bard's house the Dwarves overpower some of the Town's guards (Extended Edition), with the bystanding people not minding, but even helping the Dwarves by hiding the unconscious guardsmen, undermining the Master's authority. Bard suspects who Thorin might be, and confirms it after examining a wall hanging with Thorin's genealogy.
*In addition to [[Bain]], Bard has two other children: daughters [[Sigrid]] and [[Tilda]]. He is also revealed to be a widower. Though Bain does appear in the Appendices, he does not appear in ''The Hobbit''.
*The part of the [[Master of Lake-town]] is extended as well, displaying his corruption in a more detailed way. He has a majordomo in the film: [[Alfrid]]. Alfrid frequently informs the Master of various goings-on in the town, particularly the rumors of people plotting to possibly unseat him from his position of power - Bard (who is frequently spied on by the Master), in particular. In the book, the Master had various aides who were unnamed and only briefly mentioned.
*The story concerning the Dwarvish wind-lance appears only in the film, as does the legend that [[Girion]] loosened a scale from Smaug's breast during the [[Dragons|Dragon]]'s attack on [[Dale]].
*The discussion about Thorin's Company doesn't take place in a great hall but in front of one.
*In the book, the poem concerning the return of the [[King under the Mountain]] has a positive connotation: 
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The streams shall run in gladness
The lakes shall shine and burn,
All sorrow fail and sadness
At the Mountain-king's return!
</poem>
In the film, it is recited by Bard with a negative meaning:
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
And the bells shall ring in gladness
At the Mountain King's return,
But all shall fade in sadness,
And the lake will shine and burn.
</poem>
*Due to his worsening condition, Thorin refuses to let Kíli go up to the Mountain with the rest of the Company. [[Fíli]] and [[Óin]] opt to stay behind to look after him. Additionally, [[Bofur]] gets left behind after oversleeping. When the left-behind Dwarves ask the Master and Alfrid for help (Extended Edition) they are harshly repelled. All thirteen Dwarves went up to the Mountain in the book.
*The [[High Fells of Rhudaur]], as well as the tombs and the existence of corpses of the [[Nazgûl]], their rising, and Gandalf and [[Radagast]]'s examining of said tombs are all invented for the film.
*The events of ''The Hobbit'' take place {{TA|2941}}, but, in the books, Gandalf's second investigation of Dol Guldur happens {{TA|2850}}.
*In the Extended Edition of the film, Gandalf encounters a gaunt, bewildered Thráin while investigating Dol Guldur after discovering the open tombs of the Nine. He somewhat heals the Dwarf's insanity, and Thráin helps guide him through the fortress, also revealing that his [[Thrór|father]]'s [[Ring of Thrór|ring]] had been entrusted to him and had ultimately been cut from his finger and taken from him by [[Azog]] during the Battle of Azanulbizar (in the books, the Ring is not taken before Thráin's capture in Dol Guldur). Thráin is ultimately swallowed up by the Necromancer just before it reveals itself to Gandalf to be the [[Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]]. Gandalf calls the Dwarf his "old friend," whereas in the books he doesn't know him and doesn't realise his identity until months after the meeting. Thráin does not give [[Thrór's Map]] and Erebor's [[Back Door]] key to Gandalf in the film (apparently having done so in the films' timeline on a previous, unseen occasion).
*In the books, there is no mention of a combat between Sauron and Gandalf, and he isn't taken prisoner as depicted in the film.
*In the book, the last rays of the setting [[sun]] on [[Durin's Day]] reveal the keyhole to the [[Back Door|secret door]] into the [[Lonely Mountain]], as predicted by the [[Moon-letters|runes]] on the Thrór's Map. In the film, the light of the [[moon]] reveals the keyhole after the sun has set; the Dwarves, having tried to smash it, started to go back after losing hope.
*Bard is imprisoned toward the end of the film, purely because the Master sees him as a threat.
*Bolg's Orc pack arrives in Lake-town to ambush the remaining Dwarves, but are foiled by the arrival of Legolas and Tauriel. They retreat once they realize Thorin has already reached the Mountain.
*Bilbo has only one audience with Smaug, and does not take a gold cup from him. He also takes his Ring off not long after the Dragon detects his presence.
*Smaug seems fully aware of Thorin and Company's presence, as well as Sauron's impending attack on the Dwarves (since, as Thráin revealed to Gandalf, the Dragon is in league with Sauron).
*The climax of the film is an involved [[Battle of the Forges|battle]] between Thorin's Dwarves and Smaug inside of the Lonely Mountain, in which they ultimately try (unsuccessfully) to drown the beast in molten [[gold]] after re-lighting the forges. In the book, the Dwarves never see the Dragon at all; by the time they head downstairs to the Dragon's lair, Smaug is long gone (in fact, although they don't know it at that point, he is already dead).
*At the battle, more places of Erebor are shown than are mentioned in the books, such as the forge hall, the "Gallery of Kings," and a chamber with the corpses of those who could not escape during the [[Sack of Erebor]].
*Bilbo leaves the Mountain watching Smaug fly toward Lake-town.
