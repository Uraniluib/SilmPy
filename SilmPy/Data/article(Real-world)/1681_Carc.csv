'''Carc''' was one of the [[Ravens|ravens]] who lived on [[Ravenhill]], one of the foothills of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain. Carc seems to have been the chief of those birds, and dwelt with his wife above the [[Dwarves]]' guard-chamber on the hill. [[Thorin|Thorin]] recalled him as being wise and famous at the time the Dwarves were driven out of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Smaug]]. When Thorin returned to the Lonely Mountain 171 years later, Carc was dead, but the ravens remained, led by his son [[Roäc]].<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>
