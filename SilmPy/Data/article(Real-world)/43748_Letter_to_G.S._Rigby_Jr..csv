==From the auction==

{{Blockquote|The Lord of the Rings and its Christian/Catholic underpinnings. Tolkien, a devout Catholic, readily admits to theological elements in his famous trilogy. "There is, in fact, quite a lot of theology included in The Lord of the Rings (I was surprised to find how much when the work was analysed some time ago in a theological periodical), though perhaps it  is made more palatable by a sugar coating." <ref name=Sothebys>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/books-manuscripts-n09066/lot.227.html|articlename=Lot 227, Fine Books and Manuscripts, Including Americana, New York, 11 June 2012|website=[http://www.sothebys.com/ Sotheby's]|accessed=30 May 2013}}</ref>}}

== Transcript ==

{{blockquote|6th December, 1965.<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Rigby,<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your appreciative letter. It gave me much pleasure.<br/><br/>There is, in fact, quite a lot of theology included in The Lord of the Rings (I was surprised to find now much when the work was analysed some time ago in a theological periodical), though perhaps it is made more palatable by a sugar  coating.<br/><br/>With best wishes and thanks.<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>J. R. R. Tolkien<br/><br/>}}
