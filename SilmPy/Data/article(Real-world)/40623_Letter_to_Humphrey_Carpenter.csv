{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Carpenter,<br/><br/>You may certainly have my permission to use my book ''The Hobbit'' as a basis for a children's play. My publishers are, of course, also concerned in all forms of reproduction, but normally no objection is raised when only a limited non-commercial performance is in view. With regard to the setting of verses as songs, I am not sure what the position is. If this is intended to lead to publication, both my publishers and the Performing Rights Society (of which I am now a Member) would have to be consulted.<br/><br/>It is a long time since we met and I should be delighted to see you again. Unfortunately I am very busy at the present and am going away on [[1 April|April 1st]], so that I am afraid I shanâ€™t be able to arrange a meeting until the end of that month. Perhaps you could get in touch with me then and see what could be done. Please thank you[r] mother for her good wishes and kind regards, which we heartily return.<br/><br/>With best wishes to yourself,<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien.}}
