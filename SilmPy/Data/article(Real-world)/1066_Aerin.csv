'''Aerin''', the daughter of [[Indor]],<ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 189</ref> was a [[Men of Dor-lómin|woman of Dor-lómin]], member of the [[House of Hador]] and closely related to [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]].

After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Brodda]] the [[Easterlings|Easterling]] became the lord of [[Hithlum]], and took her as his wife against her will, hoping thus to produce an heir.  Aerin secretly helped [[Húrin]]'s wife [[Morwen]].<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 69</ref>

When [[Túrin]], son of Húrin, returned to [[Dor-lómin]], he learned from Aerin that his mother had left Hithlum.  In rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who burnt herself alive in her [[Brodda's hall|hall]], and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] now was persecuted even more cruelly.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name incorporates [[aer]] "ocean". The ending perhaps is the same in the names of Húrin and Túrin; in that case the name would mean "She who desires the Sea".
