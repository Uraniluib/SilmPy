'''Arathorn II''' ({{TA|2873}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2933|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 60) was the fifteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] and succeeded his father, [[Arador]], when he was killed in {{TA|2930|n}}. He was the father of [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], King of the [[Reunited Kingdom]].
==History==
In the last year of his father's reign as Chieftain, in {{TA|2929}}, Arathorn sought [[Gilraen]] as his wife. She was only twenty-two, so her father, [[Dírhael]], opposed the marriage. He also warned that Arathorn would not live long. Yet [[Ivorwen]], Gilraen's mother, was gifted with foresight and perceived that hope would be born from their marriage for the people of the [[Dúnedain]].<ref name="Av"/> Thus, Gilraen and Arathorn were married in {{TA|2929|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

The next year, {{TA|2930|n}}, [[Arador]], Arathorn's father, was slain by [[trolls]], and Arathorn became Chieftain. A year later, Gilraen bore him a son, whom they named [[Aragorn]]. Young Aragorn would never know his father; in {{TA|2933|n}}, Arathorn went hunting [[orcs]] with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], but was shot through the eye and killed. Gilraen took their son to [[Rivendell]] to be fostered by [[Elrond]].

Arathorn II served as [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] for just three years. He was succeeded by his only son, who would become [[Aragorn|Chieftain Aragorn II]], and in time King Elessar of the [[Reunited Kingdom of the Dúnedain]].<ref name="Av"/>

==Etymology==
Arathorn was likely named after his ancestor, [[Arathorn I]]. There have been two explanations for the name: 

In a [[Letter 347|letter]] dated [[1972]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] gave the name the meaning "Eagle King" (from ''[[aran]]'' "king" and ''[[thoron]]'' "eagle").<ref>{{L|347}}</ref> 

However, in work written in the late 50's, Tolkien gave "Steadfast King" (from ''[[aran]]'' "king" and ''[[thorn]]'' "steadfast") instead.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Words, Phrases & Passages in 'The Lord of the Rings'", ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 17]]'', page 113</ref>
