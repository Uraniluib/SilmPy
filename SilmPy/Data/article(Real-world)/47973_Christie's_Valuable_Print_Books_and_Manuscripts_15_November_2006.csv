'''''Christie's Valuable Print Books and Manuscripts 15 November 2006''''' is an auction catalogue from Christie's. Lot 152 (p. 116) consists of a 1966/1967/1967 set of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' inscribed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], together with a page of examples of [[Elvish]] script and notes.

The inscribed copy of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' is the copy that Tolkien is seen to inscribe in the BBC's 1968 documentary ''[[Tolkien in Oxford]]''. The [[tengwar]] inscription reads: ''Elen síla lúmenna omentielvo'' ("A star shines upon the hour of our meeting").

The page of tengwar examples repeats the title of the documentary three times: the first is a transliteration of English, while the second and third are translations into [[Quenya]] - [[Arcastar]] Mondósaresse. The three lines of tengwar are accompanied by explanatory notes.

Both the inscription and the page of examples and notes are reproduced in a photograph.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=72920|articlename=Valuable Print Books and Manuscripts. 2006 |dated=|website=TB|accessed=24 September 2014}}</ref>
