Creatively color the world of Oxford’s Inklings

Renowned fantasy illustrator James A. Owen presents fifteen intricate and imaginative line drawings inspired by the works of Oxford’s famous Inklings and Diana Glyer’s fascinating ''Bandersnatch''.

Printed on heavy stock on one side only, each drawing is suitable for markers, fine-tipped pens, and colored pencils. Color your way through [[The Eagle and Child]] pub, along the banks of the Isis, beneath the spires of [[University_of_Oxford#Magdalen_College|Magdalen College]] — and find (and color!) the bandersnatch hidden in each picture.

Fans of the Inklings fantasy literature and lovers of coloring books for grown-ups will enjoy relaxing with ''The Inklings Coloring Book''.<ref name=Kent/>
