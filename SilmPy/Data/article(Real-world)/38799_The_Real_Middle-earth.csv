==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|Tolkien readily admitted that the concept of Middle-earth was not his own invention but an Old English term for the Dark Age world. The Anglo-Saxons and Vikings believed their universe was held together by an interlaced web of golden threads visible only to wizards, and at its centre was the realm of Middle-earth, peopled by humans but imbued with spiritual power. Drawing on historical and archaeological research, Brian Bates uncovers the Middle-earth that centres on England - a home to dragons, elves, dwarves and demons - a land where spells had real force.}}
