On [[17 November]] [[1954]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to [[wikipedia:Rayner Heppenstall|Rayner Heppenstall]]'''.<ref name=CG>{{CG|C}}, p. 444</ref>

*'''Contents:''' Tolkien will not be able to attend the rehearsal and recording of the [[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son (radio play)|radio play ''The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth'']] on [[3 December]]. He wonders if it could be of any help if sent some notes on the text. Instead of the current conclusion (the ''Dirige''), Tolkien sends the ''[[Wikipedia:Dies Irae|Dies Irae]]''. Tolkien would like his copy of ''[[Essays and Studies (1953)|Essays and Studies]]'' to be returned (since it is his only copy), and would be thankful for receiving a copy of the script for the radio play.

==Excerpt==

{{blockquote|[Tolkien remains] rather in the dark as to how you propose to treat the thing, and what part — if any; but some hint of "background" seems necessary — of the historical notes [included with the verse-drama in ''Essays and Studies''] is to be included (as preface)<ref name=CG/>}}
