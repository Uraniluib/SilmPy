==Quotes==
{{quote|I couldn't do Viggo when he was talking low. I can't do him if he's  like this, but if he ''[he starts yelling]'' yells or skewers an orc with his sword...''[laughs][he stops yelling]'' which is mostly what video games are.|Chris Edgerly on mimicking Viggo Mortensen, [http://www.chrisedgerly.com/Chris_Comic_Con.html 2007 ComicCon].}}
