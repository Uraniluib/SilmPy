==Summary==
Tolkien lamented his son's stay in the Royal Air Force, which he considered a modern [[wikipedia:Moloch|Moloch]] (in this sense, an institution demanding costly sacrifices). He then said that his wishes were in vain, and he still feared the "war-aircraft".<ref>When Tolkien fought in the [[World War I]], planes were used to strike fear into the troops in the trenches. Though their role had changed by 1944, Tolkien still held them in "special horror".</ref>

He then discussed the writing plans of [[C.S. Lewis]] and himself. They were both writing at the time, and considered writing a book together.<ref>It is not quite clear what books they were working on. [[Humphrey Carpenter|Carpenter]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggest ''[[wikipedia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' for Lewis, and ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' for Tolkien. The book they planned to write together - ''Language and Human Nature'' - was never published.</ref>
