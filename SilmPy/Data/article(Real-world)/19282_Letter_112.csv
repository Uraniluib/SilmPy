==Summary==
Katherine Farrer, an [[Oxford]]-based detective author,<ref>[http://www.classiccrimefiction.com/university-mysteries.htm| Classic Crime Fiction, University Murder Mysteries]</ref> had apparently asked for her copy of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' to be signed. Instead, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote her a note in [[Runes]]. In the letter (transcribed on page 441), Tolkien thanks her for her request, and tells her he is glad ''The Hobbit'' is obtainable again (most stores had run out). He tells her of "[[The Lord of the Rings|the next book]]", and how it will contain [[Appendix E|more information]] about the alphabets. 

==Notes==
* Because this letter is written in [[wikipedia:Runic alphabet|Futhark]] rather than [[Cirth]], it is not included in the [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdics.html Daeron Certh Specimina].
