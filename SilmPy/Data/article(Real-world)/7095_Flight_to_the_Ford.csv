'''Flight to the Ford''' is the twelfth and last chapter in the first book of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].

==Summary==
When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] came to, he still had [[The One Ring|the Ring]], much to his relief. The [[Nazgûl|enemy]] seemed to have withdrawn, thinking that Frodo was dead or mortally wounded. [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] prepared a medicine made of leaves in boiling water and the scent calmed all of them. Though Frodo felt a little relief, he could not move his arm. In the morning Frodo was put on the [[Bill the Pony|pony]] and they set off. After several days they came to a river and crossed the [[Last Bridge|Bridge]]. Strider found an Elf-stone which gave him hope. The journey proved hazardous and they strayed far to the north.

When they turned back toward [[Rivendell]], they met [[Glorfindel]], an elf who lived in the house of [[Elrond]]. Glorfindel told them that [[Gandalf]] had met him nine days earlier and that the Black Riders were after them. Glorfindel tried to help them cross the [[Ford of Bruinen|ford]] of [[Bruinen]].

Just as they were about to cross the water, the Black Riders caught up to them with additional reinforcements. The Riders attacked Frodo's [[Asfaloth|horse]], and just as they were about to triumph, Frodo saw a shining figure of white light. The river rose and carried away the Black Riders and their horses.
