== J.R.R. Tolkien about Disney ==

Throughout his life, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had a deep concern and strong opinions about adaptations of his [[legendarium]]. For Tolkien, the products of the Disney company were an especially prominent example of bad style. 

In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as ''"too Disnified"'',
{{quote|Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 107|#107]]}}

Moreover, when certain producers became interested in movie adaptations of Tolkien's works, (he had sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to United Artists in 1968), he forbade Disney should ever be involved:
{{quote|It might be advisable [...] to let the Americans do what seems good to them â€” as long as it was possible [...] to veto anything from or influenced by the Disney studios (for all whose works I have a heartfelt loathing).|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 13|#13]]}}

In [[Letter to Jane Dixon|another letter]], Tolkien writes in 1965 that neither he nor his publishers ([[Allen and Unwin|George Allen and Unwin]]) intend to give Walt Disney permission to make a film of his books.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 648</ref>

A remarkable critique of Walt Disney was given by Tolkien in a 1964 letter to a fan:

{{quote|I recognize [Walt Disney's] talent, but it has always seemed to me hopelessly corrupted. Though in most of the 'pictures' proceeding from his studios there are admirable or charming passages, the effect of all of them to me is disgusting. Some have given me nausea|[[Letter to Miss J.L. Curry|Letter to Miss J.L. Curry, of 15 July 1964]]}}
