==Excerpts from the speech==

"Nowadays books are besieged by a great many powerful embattled enemies, some of whom have been strongly entrenched, and to be here at the opening of a strong point from which troops can be sent out against those enemies is a great honour."

"The wealth of books to be found here is food for the mind, and everyone knows that for the stomach to go without food for a long time is bad, but for the mind to go without food is even worse."<ref name=Ded/>
