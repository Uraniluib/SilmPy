==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Sing hey! for the bath at close of day
That washes the weary mud away!
A loon is he that will not sing:
O! Water Hot is a noble thing!

O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;
but better than rain or rippling streams
is Water Hot that smokes and steams.

O! Water cold we may pour at need
down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;
but better is Beer, if drink we lack,
and Water Hot poured down the back.

O! Water is fair that leaps on high
in a fountain white beneath the sky;
but never did fountain sound so sweet
as splashing Hot Water with my feet!
</poem>

'''2001: {{fotree}}:'''
:[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] sing a song at the [[Green Dragon]] closely resembling ''[[Ho! Ho! Ho! To the Bottle I Go]]'', with slightly altered lyrics that incorporate a small part of ''Sing Hey! For the Bath at Close of Day'':
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Hey Ho to the bottle I go
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow but there'll still be
Many miles to go

Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain,
And the stream that falls from hill to plain.
Better than rain or rippling brook,
Is a mug of beer inside this [[Took Family|Took]].
</poem>
