The '''Bodleian Library''', the main research library of the [[University of Oxford]], is one of the oldest libraries in Europe.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was a frequent visitor to the Bodleian, as they keep several manuscripts which were used in his studies of medieval texts: his edition of and commentary on ''[[The Old English Exodus]]'' (MS Junius 11) as well as the studies he conducted with [[Simonne d'Ardenne]] on the scholarly papers of the [[Middle English]] collection known as the [[Katherine Group]] (MS Bodley 34).

The Bodleian Library holds a large collection of original [[:CATEGORY:Manuscripts by J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien manuscripts]] at the Department of Western Manuscripts. Many of these have been donated by the [[Tolkien Estate]], and include drafts, typescripts, proofs, letters, artwork, lecture drafts and other academic working papers, books from his personal collection, family papers, and much other. The collection of manuscripts is open to access by scholars, with the exception of the family papers.
