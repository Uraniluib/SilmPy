{{disambig-more|The Lord of the Rings|[[The Lord of the Rings (disambiguation)]]}}'''The Lord of the Rings''' was a [[1979]] radio adaptation by [[Bernard Mayes]], produced by The Mind's Eye. 

It is an abridged version of the story, voiced by local Virginia theatre actors, who show serious problems pronouncing the names correctly. Due to a low budget, effects were home made, and music was low-key. 

The production was overshadowed by that of the [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC]], and is usually considered inferior in quality, music and acting.
