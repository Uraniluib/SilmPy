{{Pronounce|Denethor.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Denethor''' (lived in the [[Years of the Trees]]) was the son of the [[Nandor]] [[Elves|Elf]] leader [[Lenwë]] (also known as Dan). 

Daunted by the towering peaks of the [[Hithaeglir]], Lenwë, his son Denethor, and the Nandor forsook the march of the Elves to the [[Valinor|West]] and passed southward down the [[Anduin]]. Much later Denethor would lead a part of those people west into [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

Centuries before the first rising of the [[Sun]], [[Orcs]] and other foul creatures of [[Morgoth]] began to harass the Nandor east of the [[Blue Mountains]]. Hearing of the power and protection of the Elf King [[Thingol]], Denethor led many of his people over the Blue Mountains into Beleriand.  They settled in [[Ossiriand]] and Denethor became their king. They were called the ''[[Laiquendi]]'' ([[Quenya]] for "Green-elves").

Years later, in {{YT|1497}}, [[Morgoth]] loosed an army on Beleriand, beginning the [[First Battle of Beleriand|First Battle]] in the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars of Beleriand]].<ref>{{GA|36}}</ref> The lightly-armed Laiquendi were driven back to the great hill of [[Amon Ereb]], where Denethor was slain.<ref>{{GA|39}}</ref> While the Laiquendi survived, they became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
In an explanation of the name of [[Denethor#Etymology|Denethor II]] (who was named after this elf), the Steward of Gondor, it is stated that ''Denethor'' is [[Nandorin]] fit into the [[Sindarin]] sound range, and is said to mean "Lithe and lank".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 17</ref>

In the earlier ''[[The Lost Road]]'', the name Denethor is said to contain the word element ''Dani''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} entry DAN-</ref> According to ''[[The Lhammas]]'', it derives from [[Primitive Elvish]] ''Ndani-thārō'', meaning "Saviour of the Dani", as he was the one who led them to the West. Other derivatives of this name are: ''Daintáro'' in [[Telerin]], ''Nanisáro'' in [[Qenya]], ''Dainthor'' in [[Noldorin]] and ''Denipor'' in [[Doriathrin]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>
