This only a part of the whole letter; ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide|The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Chronology]]'' (pp. 649-50) includes a sentence not appearing in the version of ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'' (cf. [[Letter to Clyde S. Kilby (18 December 1965)]]). 

The letter is presented (and quoted from) by Kilby in the article "Woodland Prisoner" ([[SEVEN 27|''SEVEN'', Volume 27]], p. 49).
==Summary==
Tolkien said that he never had much confidence in his own work, even when he was assured that it had value for others.  Had it not been for [[C.S. Lewis]] he would never have completed or offered for publication ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  ''The Silmarillion'' was quite different and if good then good in another way.  It began in a hospital and during sick leave in World War I and had been with him and worked on ever since, yet was still in a confused state.  It needed the assistance of a scholar that was sympathetic, critical, and actually present at one's side.  Tolkien said he would be free to return to it in the next year during June through August.
