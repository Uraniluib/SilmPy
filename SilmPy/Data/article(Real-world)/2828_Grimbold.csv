'''Grimbold''' was a rider of [[Rohan]], who dwelt in [[Grimslade]]. He fought in the [[Battles of the Fords of Isen]], and fell in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

==History==
Grimbold was a valiant captain under the [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second Marshal]]. He was instrumental in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen|defense]] of the [[Fords of Isen]]; after his Marshal [[Théodred]] fell, he managed to hold the eyot in the river until [[Elfhelm]] arrived. Soon after, the troops of [[Isengard]] left; their mission was over with the death of the Marshal.

Grimbold and his company were scattered after the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]], though most of his troops survived. When [[Gandalf]] arrived, he sent Elfhelm to protect [[Edoras]] and Grimbold to join [[Erkenbrand]], who was making his way to the [[Hornburg]] in an attempt to lift the [[Battle of the Hornburg|siege]].

After the victory at [[Helm's Deep]] and the lighting of the [[warning beacons of Gondor]], [[Théoden]] had to quickly reorganize his troops. The elderly [[Erkenbrand]] commanded the defense of Rohan, while Grimbold was elected to take over command of the muster of the [[Westfold]] based on the valour he had shown at earlier battles.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|battle]], Grimbold fought on the eastern side of the [[Pelennor Fields]], where he was slain. He was remembered in the ''[[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]]'' as "doughty".<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Grimbold is briefly glimpsed twice in this film. The first time is as [[Théoden]] arrives at Dunharrow and calls out to Grimbold. In this scene he appears as an elderly man in the armour of the guard of Edoras. Later on in the film as the Rohirrim arrive at the [[Pelennor Fields]] Théoden gives Grimbold orders and tells him to "Go forth and fear no darkness!". In these scenes he was played by [[Bruce Phillips]].


'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Grimbold can be found in his encampment in eastern Heathfells in the region of the [[Gap of Rohan]]. He is later found at the Fords of Isen in the aftermath of the second battle. He is the Thane of his hometown of Grimslade, which can found in the Westfold area of the West Rohan region.
