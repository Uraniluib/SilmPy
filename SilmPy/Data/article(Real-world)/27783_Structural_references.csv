'''Structural references''' (also known as '''Arda structural references''') is a term coined by [[Anders Stenström|Beregond, Anders Stenström]] in 1998, aimed at simplifying the usage of giving references to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] by employing abbreviations and some conventions developed in ''[[Arda (annual)|Arda]]''.

{{quote|A structural reference identifies an element of the text by help of its place in the text's structure (rather than by its place in the layout of the book, which does not work when editions differ in layout).|[[Anders Stenström|Beregond, Anders Stenström]]}}

A Spanish version of the Arda structural references, called the Ardarathorn Project, was presented by the [[Sociedad Tolkien Española|Spanish Tolkien Society]] in 2004.
