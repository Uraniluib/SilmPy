==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Roads go ever, ever on
To theï»¿ lands beyond the sea. 
On a white ship will I sail,
Watching shadows part for me.

Leaving Havens grey with rain,
Now that years have slipped away.
Leaving friends with gentle pain
As they start another day.
 
The roads I travel I must leave,
For I've turned the final bend.
Weep not empty tears, but grieve
As the roads come to an end.

It's so easy not to try; 
Let the world go drifting by.
If you never say hello,
You won't have to say goodbye.

If you never say hello,
You won't have to say goodbye!
</poem>
