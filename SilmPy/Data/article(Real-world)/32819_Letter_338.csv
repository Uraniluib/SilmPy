==Summary==
Carter had asked if the Ents ever found the Entwives.  Tolkien said he did not know, having written nothing beyond the first few years of the [[Fourth Age]], except for the beginning of a tale set at the end of the reign of Eldaron<ref group="note">This was probably a misspelling of "[[Eldarion]]".</ref>  This tale concerned the restlessness and boredom of Men in the years of the Kingâ€™s Peace.<ref group="note">This unfinished tale is "The New Shadow" from ''The Peoples of Middle-earth''.</ref><ref>{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>  Tolkien thought that [[Treebeard]]'s song of the Ent and the Entwife<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> made it plain that there would be no reunion in "history".

Dealing with the Greek language made Tolkien feel like a renegade, though he once knew something about it.  He preferred Latin.
