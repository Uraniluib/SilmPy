==The poem==
''Aotrou'' and ''Itrou'' are Breton words for "lord" and "lady". The poem is modelled on the genre of the "[[wikipedia:Breton lai|Breton lay]]" popular in [[Middle English]] literature of the 12th century, and it explores the conflict of heroic or chivalric values and Christianity, and their relation to the institution of marriage.

In the poem, Aotrou and Itroun are a couple of Breton nobility. They are childless, and Aotrou seeks the help of a witch. When Itroun is with child, the witch reappears, revealing herself as the Corrigan, and asks for Atrou's love as payment. Aotrou sacrifices his knightly honour to Christian values, and breaks his word.

:''"I gave no love. My love is wed;''
:''my wife now lieth in child-bed,''
:''and I curse the beast that cheated me''
:''and drew me to this dell to thee."''

Cursed by the Corrigan to die in three days, Aotrou takes the consequences and places his trust in Providence:

:''In three days I shall live at ease''
:''and die but when it God doth please''
:''in eld, or in some time to come''
:''in the brave wars of Christendom.''

Aotrou passes away after three days, his wife dies of broken heart and they are buried together, and they do not live to see their offspring grow up.

==Relation to the Legendarium==

While not being among Tolkien's works on the [[Legendarium]], ''The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun'' includes aspects which appear to have inspired his tales of [[Arda]]:

==From the publisher==

Coming from the darker side of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination, "The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun" is an important non Middle-earth work to set alongside his other retellings of existing myth and legend, The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún, The Fall of Arthur and The Story of Kullervo.

Together with Tolkien’s “Corrigan Poems”, which are included in this book, the Aotrou and Itroun texts comprise a sequence that was the outcome of a comparatively short but intense period in Tolkien's life when he was deeply engaged with Celtic languages and mythologies.

The sequence shows the corrigan’s increasingly powerful presence, as she takes an ever more active role in the lives of Aotrou and Itroun, Lord and Lady. She would finally emerge, changed in motive and character but still recognizable, in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as the beautiful and terrible Lady of the Golden Wood, the Elven queen Galadriel.

The book is edited and introduced by Verlyn Flieger, and includes a new prefatory note on the text by Christopher Tolkien.
