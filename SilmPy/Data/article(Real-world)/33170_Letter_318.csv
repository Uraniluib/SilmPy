==Summary==
Tolkien was most grateful to Ker for sending his article on Napier.<ref group="note">A.S. Napier (1853-1916) was the Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford during Tolkien's time as an undergraduate.</ref>  Tolkien had entered the English School in 1913 at his own request, not realizing the generosity of Exeter College to allow this without depriving him of his classical exhibition.  Ker's essay confirmed Tolkien's guess that Farnell<ref group="note">L.R. Farnell, Rector (or head) of Exeter College, 1913-1928</ref> was responsible.  Farnell had introduced Tolkien to Napier, a meeting in a darkened room where he could hardly see the man.  They never spoke again although Tolkien attended his lectures.

Having missed Napier (who had advanced illness at the time) Tolkien had what he called the singular good fortune that Sisam<ref group="note">Kenneth Sisam (1887-1971) who during Tolkien's undergraduate period was a research student and assistant to Professor Napier.</ref> became his tutor.  Although Sisam derived many benefits from Napier's example, his own teaching was spiced with pungency, humour, and practical wisdom.  Sisam laid the foundation for Tolkien's own library.
