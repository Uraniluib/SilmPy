'''Lucifer Hsueh-Heng "Luc" Chu''' ([[wikipedia:Hanzi|Hanzi]] '''朱學恆''') is a Taiwanese translator, philanthropist and internet entrepreneur. Chu graduated from Taiwan's National Central University in [[1998]], with a BS in Electrical Engineering.

With news of an upcoming [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|live action film series]] about ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the late 1990's, Chu approached a local publisher to translate the works for a minimal fee; 9 percent if 10.000 box sets (or 40.000 individual copies) were sold; if not, he donated his services for free. 

The gamble paid off, and Chu became a millionnaire. He donated most of his money to his own organization [http://www.myoops.org/en/ OOPS], translating many educational books into Chinese.
