The '''Battle of the Somme''' was one of the bloodiest battles of [[World War I]], and indeed human history.<ref name="Brewer">Paul Brewer (2007). ''The Chronicle of War: A Year-by-Year Account of Conflict from 1854 to the Present Day''. London: Carlton Books.</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] fought there from [[July]] to [[October]] [[1916]], as Battalion Signalling Officer to the 11th Batallion of The Lancashire Fusiliers. His unit was stationed in the northern sector of the Somme and participated in the [[wikipedia:Battle of Thiepval Ridge|Battle of Thiepval Ridge]] and [[wikipedia:Regina Trench|capture of Regina Trench]].<ref name="WarMuseum">Imperial War Museum.

Retrieved 2010-08-22.</ref> In October Tolkien contracted [[wikipedia:Trench fever|trench fever]] and was evacuated to England to convalesce; he did not return to the front lines.

Among the hundreds of thousands of young men killed at the Somme were two of Tolkien's close school friends: [[Robert Gilson]] and [[Geoffrey Bache Smith]]. Tolkien discussed the death of Gilson in a [[Letter 6|letter]] written in the trenches to Smith shortly before he too was killed by shrapnel. The "hideous" experience of the Battle, as Tolkien described it, is often seen to be reflected in his written work.<ref name="BBC">Lisa Jardine.

The [[Dead Marshes]] were inspired by the landscape of northern France in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>{{L|226}}</ref>
