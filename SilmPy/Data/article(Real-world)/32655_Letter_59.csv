==Summary==
Tolkien reported seriously trying to finish his book, staying up late, re-reading and doing research.  It was painfully sticky getting into the swing again.  Back to [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] to try to work out their adventures; they just met [[Gollum]] on a precipice.  Tolkien complemented his son on all the work he put into typing and wished he still had his services.
