Some years before [[1968]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] allegedly wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to Dorothy'''.

*'''Authenticity:''' "...most likely genuine. If it isn't, it is a particularly well-informed and elaborate hoax" - [[Carl F. Hostetter]]<ref name="Carl">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/6616</ref>.
*'''Publication:''' Only one [[Quenya]] sentence published in mailing lists.

== Comment and Excerpt ==
Dorothy had sent [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] a letter asking him how to say "Merry Christmas" in [[Elvish]]; Tolkien replied that the [[Elves]] did not celebrate Christmas but they had a generic wish: ''[[mer-|Meri[n]]] [[sa]] [[harya-|harya]]lye [[alasse]]'' "I hope that you have happiness" (adding in a case of a mortal: ''[[nó]] [[vanya-|vanya]]lye [[Ambar]]ello'' "before you pass from the world").

==Legacy==
In a letter dated [[14 October|October 14]] [[1968]] Dorothy mentioned Tolkien's letter and the Elvish phrase to a Ms Dawson with whom they shared love for Tolkien's work. In her letter, she transcribed the first word as ''Meriu''.

On [[1 April|April 1]] [[1999]], Dawson's son, Michael sent a mail to the [[Tolkien Mailing List]] inquiring the identity of his mother's friend. He asked whether such a letter by Tolkien has been published in [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s "''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''" so that he would identify and trace that Dorothy. Nobody could help Michael Dawson identify Dorothy, since the letter had never been published.
===Significance and authenticity===
Linguists of [[Tolklang]] and [[Elfling]] considered the Elvish sentence another piece of the Quenya puzzle; most importantly, the previously unknown words ''sa'' "that" (introducing a secondary sentence) and ''nó'' "before". They also corrected the first word ''meriu'' as a misread ''merin'': u and n tended to look identical in Tolkien's handwriting,<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/errors.htm|articlename=Probable Errors in the Etymologies}}: "''The letter '''n''' is involved in very many of the probable misreadings, [...] being misinterpreted (as [...] '''u''')''"</ref> and the word was supposed to be a verb in [[Quenya#Pronouns|1st person singular]].

The Quenya sentence, known as "Merin Sentence", has been critically analyzed in publications such as [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 14|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' 14]] by [[Lisa Star]].

Some of the oddities concerning the phrase were that Michael Dawson sent his mail on April 1st ([[Wikipedia:Fool's Day|Fool's Day]]), and afterwards nobody could contact him<ref name="Helge">[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/less-d.rtf Quenya Lesson 20]</ref>. [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (who was forwarded Dawson's mail by Hostetter) said that they had not encountered these 'new' words as such in any of Tolkien's unpublished papers.<ref name="Carl"/>

It is of note that the vocabulary of the sentence fits ''[[The Etymologies]]'' suggesting that the letter to Dorothy was not written later than the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''<ref name="Helge"/>. In later publications, the word ''sa'' has been seen again in a text as "that"<ref>{{VT|49}} p.18</ref> but the word ''nó'' was given as "but".<ref>{{VT|41}}</ref>
