'''Gothic''' was the language of the Goths; the oldest known Germanic language, it is now extinct and left no descendants. As a Germanic language, Gothic was related to [[Old English]] and [[Old Norse]].

Gothic was the first language that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] studied for his own pleasure, and it may have given an impulsion in the first development of [[Qenya]]. Tolkien even attempted to reconstruct some parts of the language and such elements survived in [[Taliska]], the language he created for the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]]. He also composed a full poem, ''[[Bagmē Blōma|Bagme Bloma]]'' "The Flower of the Trees" in Gothic.

According to [[Lisa Star]], Tolkien also devised a [[tengwar]] mode for Gothic which is known to exist, but remain unpublished to date.<ref>{{webcite|author=Lisa Star|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027110101/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/9902/unpub.html|articlename=A List of Tolkien's Unpublished and Slightly Published Manuscripts|dated=August 2002|website=[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027074431/http://geocities.com/Athens/Parthenon/9902/ Tyalie Tyelellieva website (archived)]|accessed=2 January 2012}}</ref>

==Gothic names in Tolkien's legendarium==
Since in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Old English represents [[Rohirric]], Tolkien used Gothic to represent the earlier language of the [[Northmen]] of  [[Rhovanion]] in accordance to the similarity between these languages. 

*[[Vidugavia]]
*[[Vidumavi]]
*[[Vinitharya]]
*[[Marhwini]]
*[[Marhari]]
*[[Forthwini]]

However, in reality Old English was not directly related to Gothic as the way Rohirric was to Northern; therefore Tolkien's simulation does not reflect exactly the relationship between these languages but rather their similarity.
