'''''Reading The Lord of the Rings: New Writings on Tolkien's Classic''''' is a  collection of academic essays on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Beginning with an analysis of the critical history of Tolkien, the first section, Context and Criticism, examines and contrasts the historical and intellectual context of the books, films and their criticism. The second, Space, Place and Communities, turns to the philosophical and post-colonial concerns which structure contemporary understandings of the book and film. The third section, Gender, Sexuality and Class, shows how these issues are depicted in the novles and films. The final section, Tolkien's Futures, looks at the continuing influence of his work in both more traditional literary forms and in contemporary game and electronic narrative.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=122352&SearchType=Basic|articlename=Reading The Lord of the Rings|dated=|website=[http://www.continuumbooks.com/default.aspx Continuumbooks.com]|accessed=18 January 2012}}</ref>}}
