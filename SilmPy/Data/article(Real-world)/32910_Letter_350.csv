==Summary==
Tolkien wrote to [[Christopher Wiseman]] (lamenting the speed of the passing of time) to tell him of a letter discovered in a pile that he had received in ''May'' of 1972.  C.V.L. Lycett had written to him from Los Angeles to reminisce about [[Wikipedia: King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] and Tolkien wanted Wiseman to hear part of it.  Lycett told Tolkien that he had admired and envied the wit of the select coterie (which Tolkien said was never meant to be) of himself, Wiseman, [[Geoffrey Bache Smith|G.B Smith]], [[Robert Gilson|R.Q. Gilson]], [[Vincent Trought|V. Trought]], and [[Wilfrid "Whiffy" Payton|Payton]].  Lycett said he had hovered on the outskirts to gather up the gems.

Tolkien reported being established in Merton, still active and lively although he had been sick for a long time after his 81st birthday (not connected events).  He was now deprived of all wines and on a restricted diet but still allowed to smoke and consume alcoholic products of barley.

Tolkien wished his friend kind regards and good wishes to his wife, and after his name added the letters "[[T.C.B.S.|TCBS]]".
