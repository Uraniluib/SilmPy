'''Worldcon''' - the ''' World Science Fiction Convention''' is the annual science fiction convention of the '''World Science Fiction Society''' ('''WSFS'''). It has been held each year since 1939 (except for the years 1942 to 1945, during World War II). The members of each Worldcon are the members of WSFS, and vote both to select the site of the Worldcon two years later, and to select the winners of the annual Hugo Awards, which are presented at each convention.<ref>Worldcon at Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldcon (accessed 1 September 2016)</ref>
