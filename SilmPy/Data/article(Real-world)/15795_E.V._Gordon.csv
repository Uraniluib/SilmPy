'''Eric Valentine Gordon''' ([[14 February]] [[1896]] â€“ [[1938]]) was a Canadian philologist who worked alongside [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] on various scholastic works and published books. Gordon was educated at [[wikipedia:Victoria College, British Columbia|Victoria College]] and [[wikipedia:McGill University|McGill University]]. He also attended [[wikipedia:University College, Oxford|University College]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] (1920), and later taught at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] (1922-1931) and [[wikipedia:University of Manchester|Manchester University]] (1932-1938).<ref>[[Jane Chance]] (2003), ''[[Tolkien the Medievalist]]''</ref> In 1930, he married [[Ida Gordon|Ida Pickles]], a former student.

==Works with Tolkien on Old and Middle English==
While Tolkien was teaching at [[Leeds University]], Gordon worked with him on ''[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]'' and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. After Gordon had come to Leeds, Tolkien wrote in [[Diary of J.R.R. Tolkien|his diary]] "Eric Valentine Gordon has come and got firmly established and is my devoted friend and pal."<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]] (2000), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', New York: Houghton Mifflin, page 111</ref>

While Gordon died in 1938, yet another two works, to which Tolkien contributed, were published posthumously by [[Ida Gordon|Ida]], Gordon's wife and a philologist as well. The first was ''[[Pearl (E.V. Gordon)|Pearl]]'' (1953; Tolkien contributed to this book with a section, "[[Form and Purpose]]", in the introduction) and the second was ''[[The Seafarer (I.L. Gordon)|The Seafarer]]'' (1960).<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]] (2000), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', New York: Houghton Mifflin, page 145</ref><ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]] (2001). ''[[A Question of Time]]'', p. 262</ref> Both works were revised and completed by Ida Gordon.
==The Viking Club ==
Gordon also began the ''[[Viking Club]]'' with Tolkien. In this club they would read [[Old Norse|Old Icelandic]] sagas (and drink beer) with students and faculty, and invent original [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] songs. A collection of these was privately published as the book ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]''.
