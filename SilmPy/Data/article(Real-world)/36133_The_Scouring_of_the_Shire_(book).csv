''This supplement is an invaluable guide to collecting, painting and gaming with Games Workshop's detailed The Lord of The Rings miniatures. Within its colourfully illustrated pages you will find essential rules, information, and inspiration to bring the battles of Middle-earth to your own tabletop.''

RULES

Full rules for new Good and Evil forces, including Hobbit Warriors and Heroes, Sharkey and his band of Ruffians and the likes of Golfimbul and the dreaded White Wargs.

SCENARIOS

A linked campaign of six scenarios tells the story of Sharkey's occupation of the Shire and the desperate plight of the Hobbits, from the first Ruffians sneaking through the Shire's bounds to the Battle of Bywater, the greatest battle ever fought in the Shire. An appendix details some of the more memorable events in the Shire's history through six additional scenarios, such as the Battle of Greenfields and the Fell Winter.

MODELLING TIPS

Detailed advice is given on creating the colourful scenery of the Shire, from Hobbit-holes to traps and snares, as well as painting guides for Hobbits, Sharkey's Ruffians and Warg Riders.
