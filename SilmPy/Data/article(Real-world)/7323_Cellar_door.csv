In his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] mentioned '''cellar door''' as a combination of English words having an especially beautiful sound independent of their meaning (i.e. purely [[wikipedia:Phonaesthetics|phonaesthetically]] beautiful):
{{blockquote|Most English-speaking people ... will admit that cellar door is 'beautiful', especially if dissociated from its sense (and from its spelling). More beautiful than, say, sky, and far more beautiful than beautiful</span>. Well then, in Welsh for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent, and moving to the higher dimension, the words in which there is pleasure in the contemplation of the association of form and sense are abundant.}}
Because of this speech Tolkien is one of several prominent writers and linguists to whom the phrase is often erroneously attributed.<ref>Graeme Green, '[http://news.scotsman.com/lordoftherings/A-cellar-door-to-the.2487132.jp A cellar door to the soul]'.
