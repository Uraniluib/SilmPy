Tolkien's War in Middle-Earth''''' is a real-time strategy game released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, MS-DOS, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in [[1988]] by Australian company [[Melbourne House]].<ref name="Tolkien Games">[http://www.lysator.liu.se/tolkien-games/entry/wime.html Tolkien Games] (retrieved 4 December 2010)</ref><ref name="El Anillo">[http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=CON&id=2254&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=5 Meristation, El Anillo interactivo] p. 6 (retrieved 4 December 2010)</ref><ref name="Giantbomb">[http://www.giantbomb.com/jrr-tolkiens-war-in-middle-earth/61-19688/ GiantBoomb] (retrieved 4 December 2010)</ref><ref name="Spectrum">[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi War in Middle-Earth] at [[wikipedia:World of Spectrum|World of Spectrum]] (retrieved 4 December 2010)</ref>

The game combined both a large-scale army-unit level and a small-scale character level. All the action happened simultaneously in the game world and places could be seen from the map or at the ground level. Individual characters could also be seen in larger battles (in which they either survived or died â€” [[Gandalf]] alone could easily defeat a hundred [[orcs]]). If the battle is quite small (less than 100 units approximately) it can be watched on ground level. Otherwise it will be only displayed numerically. On ground level characters could acquire objects<Ref name="Giantbomb"/> and talk with computer controlled friendly characters (such as [[Radagast]] or [[Tom Bombadil]]). It was designed by [[Mike Singleton]],<ref name="Tolkien Games"/><ref name="El Anillo"/><ref name="Spectrum"/><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406330/ The Interactivo Fiction Database] (retrieved 4 December 2010)</ref> [[Robert Clandy]]<ref>   [http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/jrr-tolkiens-war-in-middle-earth Moby Games] (retrieved 7 December 2010)</ref> and [[Alan B.
