'''Mika Milovana''' was the princess of [[Dale]] in the [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|1966 adaptation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name="video">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UBnVL1Y2src|articlename=The Hobbit.mp4|dated=5-Jan-2012|website=[http://www.youtube.com/ YouTube]|accessed=17-Feb-2012}}</ref>

==History==
Princess Mika Milovana was one of three who survived the destruction of [[Dale]] by the dragon [[Smaug|Slag]], the others being a watchman and [[Thorin|General Torin Oakenshield]].<ref name="video"/>

The Princess got angry when [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] refused to accept his prophesied role of the dragon slayer and declared that she would go alone to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. Dismayed that a child should enter into such peril, Bilbo agreed to go.<ref name="video"/>

After Bilbo had killed Slag, Dale was restored. Bilbo and Mika reigned there together for a time before they returned to [[Hobbiton]].<ref name="video"/>

==Etymology==
According to [[Gene Deitch]], the director of [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1966 film)]], the Princess was named after [[Wikipedia:Pete Seeger|Pete Seegerâ€™s]] eldest daughter "[[Wikipedia:Mika Seeger|Mika]]". Her second name, "Milovana", 'means a beloved woman' in [[Wikipedia:Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Gene Deitch]]|articleurl=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/#comment-1392|articlename=William L.
