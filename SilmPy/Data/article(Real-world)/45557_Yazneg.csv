'''Yazneg''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] who was [[Azog]]'s initial lieutenant during his pursuit of [[Thorin and Company]] in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' film series]]. He was played by John Rawls. His appearance was derived from early concept designs for Azog.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/azog-bolg-and-yazneg-the-trios-tangled-design-history/|articlename=Azog, Bolg … and Yazneg: The trio’s tangled design history|dated=16 December 2013|accessed=17 June 2017|website=[http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com A Tolkienist Perspective]}}</ref>

==History==
After spotting the Company of [[Dwarves]] camping out, Yazneg sent [[Fimbul]] to tell Azog that they found Thorin and his Company. They catch up with Thorin near [[Rivendell]], but are distracted by [[Radagast]] and his rabbit sled. However, during the chase, an orc spotted where Thorin and his Company were hiding. The orcs then encircle the dwarves and attempt to attack them, but were forced to retreat due to an attack by [[Elrond]] and his [[Elves|Elven]] forces. Yazneg and Fimbul returned to Weathertop, where Azog ultimately threw Yazneg to the pack's [[Wargs]] to feast upon, with Fimbul becoming his new lieutenant.
==Etymology==
Yazneg is not a name created by Tolkien and its derivation isn't explained within the films. However [[David Salo]], who worked as a linguistic consultant for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], provides an Orkish wordlist on his blog which glosses ''yaz'' as "name" and ''-neg'' as "without".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://midgardsmal.com/yrksk-ordabok/|articlename=Yrksk Orðabók|author=[[David Salo]]|dated=7 January 2014|accessed=28 December 2017|website=[http://midgardsmal.com/ Midgardsmal]}}</ref>
