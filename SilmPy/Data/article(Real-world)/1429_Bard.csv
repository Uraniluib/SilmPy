'''Bard the Bowman''' (died [[Third Age]] 2977), was a man of [[Lake-town]], and later the restored [[King of Dale]]. 

==History==
Bard served as a soldier in [[Lake-town]], and was one of the most skilled archers among [[Men]]. He was the heir of [[Girion]], the last [[Lord of Dale|lord]] of [[Dale]]. Noted for his grim face and spirit, he was an able archer and inherited his [[Black Arrow]] from his ancestors. Considering it a lucky heirloom, he always used it last.<ref name="Fire"/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Black Arrow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - The Black Arrow]]
Bard organized the defense of the town when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] attacked.  When the old [[Thrushes|thrush]] (who had overheard [[Bilbo Baggins]]' description of [[Smaug]]<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>) revealed an unarmoured spot on the Dragon's underside to Bard, he shot the dragon's heart with the Black Arrow. Because of his miraculous shot he was given the epithet "the Bowman" and "the Dragon-slayer".<ref name="Fire"/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|[[Bilbo Baggins]] delivers the [[Arkenstone]] to [[Thranduil]] and Bard]]
After the disaster, he led the [[Lake-men]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]] demanding a part of the treasure from the [[Dwarves]].<ref name="Gather">{{H|Gathering}}</ref> The [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and [[Thranduil]] came to demand their own shares. Seeing [[Thorin]]'s reluctancy to help, Bilbo Baggins delivered the [[Arkenstone]] to them to bargain with.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref> Afterwards, when the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] came, Bard led his Men in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

The victors divided the treasure and Bard took Bilbo's fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the Arkenstone, whereupon he shared his reward with the [[Master of Lake-town]] to rebuild the town, and gave Thranduil the emeralds of Girion.<ref name="Gather"/> However, the Master stole the money and ran off into the wild where he died.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> 

Three years later, after the rebuilding of the city, Bard became the first [[King of Dale|King]] of [[Kingdom of Dale|restored Dale]] as a wise and able ruler.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son, [[Bain]].<ref name="TA"/>

== Etymology ==
As a Lake-man, Bard's name was in the [[language of Dale]], which is represented by [[Old Norse]] in the book.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref><ref>{{L|144}}</ref> In other Germanic names (such as [[Isembard Took|Isembard]]), ''bard'' refers to ''beard''. This could be either the facial hair, or more likely ''"Battle-Axe"'' (''beard'' is also a term for a part of an axe).

Robert Ireland and [[Ruth S. Noel]], who perhaps overlooked the connection to Old Norse, provide as translations the [[Celtic]] words, ''bárd'' ("guardian")<ref>Robert Ireland, [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/LOTR/LOTR_AC.html Lord of the Rings Dictionary, A - C]</ref> and ''bard'' ("poet").<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', "The Languages of Rhovanion"</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In his original concept of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] intended Bilbo Baggins to be the slayer of Smaug the Dragon, stabbing him in his sleep in his lair in the [[Lonely Mountain]].  Tolkien then changed his mind and in a major shift decided that Smaug would die at [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref>{{HH|PNC}}, pp. 496-497</ref>  This necessitated the creation of a hero, Bard, who was revealed to be the descendant of Girion.  Having created this dragon-slayer, Tolkien was going to let him die in the wreck of Lake-town.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, p. 549</ref>  However, realizing new possibilities for the story, especially having a rightful claimant to part of the dragon's hoard other than the Dwarves, Tolkien kept Bard alive.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, (i) ''Bard the Dragon-Slayer'', p. 555</ref>

The Dwarves agree to pay him to smuggle them into [[Lake-town]] and get the weapons and supplies they need for reaching the [[Lonely Mountain]]. He takes them in to his home until they plan to leave. When he learns of Thorin's true identity, he becomes worried about the Dwarves' quest, believing the [[Smaug|Dragon]] will destroy everything in its path if awakened.

:Known by the [[Master of Lake-town]] (and his right hand man [[Alfrid]]) to be the descendant of [[Girion]], the last [[lord of Dale]], and fearing he may be trying to undermine their authority, Bard is under constant surveillance by various spies.

He becomes a hero among the town's survivors and leads them in taking refuge in the remains of [[Dale]]. When [[Thranduil]] arrives with an army of [[Elves]] to attack the mountain, Bard attempts to peacefully come to terms with Thorin. He asks him for a portion of the treasure which Thorin had promised to the people of Lake-town, but Thorin refuses to give them anything while Thranduil's army remains. After this, Bard reluctantly joins Thranduil in his attack. However, the arrival of an [[Orcs|Orc]] army leads all involved to refocus their attention and battle the Orcs instead.
