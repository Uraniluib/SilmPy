'''Bolg of the North''' was an Orc warlord.
==History==
Bolg was the son of [[Azog]],<ref name=H17>{{H|17}}</ref> who succeeded his father as leader of the northern [[Orcs]] after Azog was killed by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in [[Third Age]] {{TA|2799|n}}.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> This started Bolg's hatred towards the [[Dwarves]] and after the [[Great Goblin]] was killed during an encounter with [[Thorin and Company]] in {{TA|2941}}, his hatred for them grew even more.{{fact}}

Bolg gathered an army of [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] to their capital at [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]]. They marched eastward through the [[Grey Mountains]] with a host of [[Wargs]] and a cloud of [[bats]] overhead.<ref name=H17/>

Once they reached the [[Lonely Mountain]], Bolg led the Orcs and Wargs into [[Battle of the Five Armies|battle]] with the Dwarves, [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]], and [[Lake-men]]. Surrounding him was a group of huge Orcs with steel scimitars.<ref name=H17/> When [[Thorin]] attempted to pierce their ranks he became surrounded, and would later die from the wounds he sustained. The [[Eagles]] arrived and after them came [[Beorn]] in the shape of a bear. Beorn killed Bolg and the Orcs and Wargs were soon defeated.<ref>{{H|18}}</ref>

==Etymology==
There have been several attempts to give a meaning of the name ''Bolg''. One is a regular [[Orkish]] treatment of ''[[Boldog]]'', another a connection to [[Westron]] ''[[Bolger Family#Etymology|bolg]]''. 

In ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', a word from a little known and little expanded language, ''[[Mágol]]'', is given, ''bolg'', which means "strong". [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] at one time considered making Mágol an Orkish language. An [[wikipedia:Primitive Irish|Ivernian]] word "bolg", of unknown meaning, is also cited by [[John D. Rateliff|Rateliff]].<ref>{{HM|RB}}, p. 710</ref>

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Bolg is played by [[Conan Stevens]] in this film via practical costume.<ref name="TORNBolg">{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/04/22/55228-exclusive-hobbits-conan-stevens-chats-with-torn/|articlename=Exclusive: ‘Hobbit’s’ Conan Stevens chats with TORn|dated=22-April-2012|website=TORN|accessed=05-September-2012}}</ref> He makes a brief appearance during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], where he is seen fighting against [[Dwalin]] during the flashback to the battle outside [[Moria]], until he is incapacitated and knocked down. He is, however, never actually identified as being Bolg in the film.<ref group=note>While Bolg was redesigned for motion capture performance and recast for the two following films, Conan Stevens ''does'' reprise this character as the [[Keeper of the Dungeons|Orc dungeon keeper]] at [[Dol Guldur]] in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' who torments [[Gandalf]] as he is imprisoned there. The Orc also attempts to reclaim [[Narya]] from the [[Wizards|Wizard]] for his [[Sauron|master]] right before being vanquished by [[Galadriel]] upon her arrival, though this segment only occurs in the film's [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]]</ref>

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Bolg is played by [[Lawrence Makoare]] via motion capture in this film. Azog - who survives the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] in these films - is summoned to Dol Guldur to become the commander of [[Sauron]]'s [[Orcs|Orc]] armies. While there, [[Azog]] dispatches his son Bolg to take his place in hunting Thorin and Company. With his pack of Orcs, Bolg tracks Thorin and Company through [[Mirkwood]], attacks the Wood-elves as the Company escapes in barrels, and eventually follows the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] to [[Lake-town]].
:At Lake-town, Bolg and a team of stealth-Orcs raid Bard's home in search of the Dwarves, but find only four. When they attack, they are in turn attacked by two [[Elves]]: [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]]. He goes after Legolas, and the two begin a duel (in which the Elf uses [[Orcrist]], the weapon of [[Thorin]]). However, the two adversaries prove to be evenly-matched, so Bolg decides to make his retreat. While Legolas is distracted by other Orcs, Bolg withdraws and rides a Warg down a dock. He is then pursued by Legolas, now on a horse.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Once again performed via motion capture, Bolg is played by [[John Tui]] this time. He is first seen in this film when he meets his father who is leading Sauron's forces to capture [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. When he realises [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] will come to Erebor, Azog sends Bolg to lead a separate Orc army detachment raised in [[Gundabad]]. Arriving with an advance force, he aids his father against Thorin [[Oakenshield]]'s commando team on [[Ravenhill]], nearly kills the Elf Tauriel, and slays the Dwarf [[Kíli]] when he comes to her defense. Soon afterwards, however, he is confronted and killed by Legolas, who drives one of his battle-knives into his head. Bolg's body subsequently falls off the mountain and is crushed by a boulder falling on top of it.
