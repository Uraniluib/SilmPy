==Summary==
Tolkien was touched and excited by a kind letter Mrs. Farrer had sent to him.<ref group="note">She had apparently asked to read ''The Silmarillion'' and related materials.</ref> Although he had worked on "[[Legendarium|these things]]" since 1914 only [[C.S. Lewis]] and his [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] had wanted to read them and no one wanted to publish them.  After she had written, Tolkien collected what was more or less finished (and legible) for her to read.  He said that the "compendious history" or ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' was tolerable but only half-revised.

Tolkien listed three long tales that were incomplete or not up to date: ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]'', "The Lay of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]" (verse), and ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.  He was distressed that he could not find the "Rings of Power".  It, plus the "Fall of [[Númenor]]", linked the ''Silmarillion'' with the Hobbit world.  He promised to bring round some unique manuscripts for her.
