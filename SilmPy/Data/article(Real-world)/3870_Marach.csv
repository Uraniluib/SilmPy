'''Marach''' ({{FA|282}}-{{FA|376|n}}<ref name="Hador">{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador''</ref>) was one of the original leaders of the [[Edain]] when they migrated into [[Beleriand]].  He was the father of two sons, [[Malach|Malach Aradan]] the elder, and [[Imlach]] the younger. Marach was the great-great-grandfather of [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]].

==History==
Marach's people were the most numerous of the groups of [[Men]] that moved westward over the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[First Age]].  Due to the size of Marach's host they kept together and moved slowly – so much so that although Marach was originally in the lead he was passed by the people of [[Bëor]] and the [[Haladin]].  When the Haladin crossed over the mountains they were turned north by the unfriendship of the [[Green-elves]].  However, when the folk of Marach followed the Haladin a year later, marching in ordered companies of tall, warlike folk, the Elves of [[Ossiriand]] stayed out of their way.

Marach's people did not tarry in Ossiriand for they had heard that the people of [[Bëor]] had found a green and fertile land.  Marching down the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] they settled to the south and east of the lands of [[Baran]], son of Bëor, in a region called [[Estolad]].

Most of the people of Marach wanted to journey further west, so [[Malach| Malach Aradan]], the son of Marach, led them to the southern slopes of [[Ered Wethrin]].  Marach however chose to remain in Estolad until his death.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally it was [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]] who led the people of the third house of the Edain across the Ered Luin into Beleriand; this was changed so that Hador became Marach's descendant of the fourth generation.<ref name="Hador"/>
