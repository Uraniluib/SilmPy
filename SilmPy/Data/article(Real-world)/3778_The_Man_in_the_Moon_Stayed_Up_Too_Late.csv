'''The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late''' is a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] poem composed by [[Bilbo Baggins]].

==History==
In ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' at [[Bree]] [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] jumped on a table and recited "a ridiculous song" invented by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

==Form==
The poem is in thirteen ballad-like five-line stanzas, introducing each element in turn: "the [[Man in the Moon]]" himself, the ostler's "tipsy cat that plays a five-stringed fiddle", the little dog, the "horn√©d cow".

:Frodo sings an abridged version of the song at the Prancing Pony before falling off the table and accidentally slipping on the [[The One Ring|Ring]] for the first time, causing him to disappear and startle the patrons.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Frodo sings the song in Bree. Speeding up at every line, he becomes nigh unintelligible near the end.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Frodo sings an abridged version at the Prancing Pony. The line fragment ''"And there they brew a beer so brown"'' was changed to ''"And there they '''made''' a '''stew''' so brown"'', presumably to censor references to alcohol.

:In the Extended Edition of the film, [[Bofur]] sings an abridged version in [[Rivendell]] while the [[Thorin and Company|Company]] dines with the [[Elves]], and the other [[Dwarves]] join in.

A musical version of this poem was recorded by the [[Tolkien Ensemble]] on their album ''[[An Evening in Rivendell]]''.

==Inspiration==
In the context of the legendarium, this song is the imagined original (by back formation) ditty that is derived to 'our time' in the simplified nursery rhyme "Hey Diddle Diddle".{{fact}}

The title of this version is given in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.<ref>{{AB|Up}}</ref>
