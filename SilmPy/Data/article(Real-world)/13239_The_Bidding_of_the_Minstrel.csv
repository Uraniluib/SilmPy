'''The Bidding of the Minstrel, from the Lay of Eärendel''' is a poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It is one of several early poems concerning [[Eärendil]] published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''<ref name="LT">{{HM|LT2}}, "[[The Tale of Eärendel]]"</ref>.

The short (36 lines in its final version) poem consists of an exhortation to recount the tale of "Eärendel the wandering", perhaps referring to ''[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast]]'' composed earlier that year, and a reply from the eponymous minstrel. He laments:
{{blockquote|<poem>But the music is broken, the words half-forgotten,
[...]
The song I can sing is but shreds one remembers
Of golden imaginings fashioned in sleep,
A whispered tale told by the withering embers
Of old things far off that but few hearts keep.</poem>}}

In total four drafts were written at St. John's Street, Oxford in the winter of [[1914]]. Earlier titles were ''The Minstrel renounces the song'' and ''The Lay of Eärendel''.
