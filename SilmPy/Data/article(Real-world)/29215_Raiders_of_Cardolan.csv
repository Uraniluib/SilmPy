Pirates from the south sail from a hidden harbor on the Dark Cape coast. Loot, lives, and a ship are at stake. Do you dare challenge The Sea-raiders at Minas Thonfalon? 

The remnants of the ancient Petty-dwarf race haunt the Black Wood. Their involvement in dark schemes may embroil the entire region. Are you willing to venture Into the Meur Tol?
