'''''Realms of Tolkien''''' is a 1996 book collecting various pieces of art inspired by the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

==From the Publisher==
Following the success of ''[[Tolkien's World: Paintings of Middle-earth|Tolkien's World]]'', this new collection of shining illustrations inspired by the work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is as beautiful and unique as its predecessor.

This breathtaking four-color volume is designed in a deluxe, oversized format, and includes paintings from a diverse group of international artists. Each picture is accompanied by text from the relevant passage in Tolkien's fiction as well as a personal statement by the artist about the inspiration and influence J.R.R. Tolkien has had on their work.

Includes works by an electric group of artists, both famous and up-and-coming:
* [[Alan Lee]], renowned for his atmospheric interpretations of folklore and legend, as well as his stunning illustrations for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''
* [[John Howe]], creator of many Tolkien book covers and acclaimed for his powerful representations of the landscapes and peoples of [[Middle-earth]]
* [[Ted Nasmith]], known for his classically accurate and dramatic pictures
* [[Inger Edelfeldt]], illustrator of many beautiful and unusual Tolkien calendars, book covers and posters.
