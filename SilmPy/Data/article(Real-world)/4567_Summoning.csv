== Musical Characteristics ==
Summoning is known for their epic-style, Tolkien-related atmospheric black metal style, with emphasis on keyboards.  Their trademark sound is characterized by:
* very minimalistic guitars often low in the mix
*  heavily programmed and reverberated drums giving a very cavernous feel to the rhythm
* strong, multi-layered synthesizer and keyboard melodies mimicking a full orchestra which often dominates the rest of the mix
* Vocals are still sung in the traditional black metal fashion, however they are often heavily reverberated as well, again giving a very epic and roomy sound to the songs.
