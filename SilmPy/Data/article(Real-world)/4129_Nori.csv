'''Nori''' was one of [[Durin's Folk]] and likely dwelt in the northern [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the latter had settled there.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He was one of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Nori lived with his share of the treasure at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
===Family and birth===
Nori's parentage is unknown although he was a remote kinsman of Thorin and a member of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name="Durin"/>  His birth year is also unknown.  However, from [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years"<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that after Thorin had been captured, [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>  Since Fíli was born in {{TA|2859}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Nori's birth between 2809 and {{TA|2763|n}}, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.  Nori (and [[Dori]]) shared Bilbo's opinion that meals should be plentiful and frequent.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

===The Quest of Erebor===
Nori  was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  He wore a purple hood.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Nori (along with Dori and [[Ori]]) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Nori and Ori were the second two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Nori fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Nori lived a wealthy life after the quest as one of the reclaimers of the mountain.  He was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]],<ref name="Meetings"/> and may have fought in the [[Battle of Dale]].  His date of death is unknown.

==Etymology==
''Nóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It most likely means "Little shaver, small bit of something".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

:{{Blockquote|Perhaps the most elusive member of The Company of Thorin Oakenshield, Nori is often in trouble with the dwarvish authorities. Deciding it might be a good time to leave town, he readily joins the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, not realizing the journey ahead may well lead him into far more trouble than he has left behind. Nobody ever quite knows what the quick-witted and wily Nori is up to, except that it’s guaranteed to be dodgy and quite possibly illegal. Despite rarely seeing eye-to-eye with his brothers Dori and Ori, he is nonetheless immensely loyal and will protect them by whatever means possible.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="HobbitApp">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}
