'''''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo''''' is a collection of three translations of [[Middle English]] texts (''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'' and ''[[Sir Orfeo (poem)|Sir Orfeo]]'') by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], published posthumously by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Inside Flap==
SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT, PEARL, and SIR ORFEO are masterpieces of a remote and exotic age--the age of chivalry and wizards, knights and holy quests. Yet it is only in the unique artistry and imagination of J.R.R. Tolken that the language, romance, and power of these great stories comes to life for modern readers, in this masterful and compelling new translation.
