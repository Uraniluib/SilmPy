==Note==
In editions prior to the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]]'', the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]] mentions two events on this day in {{TA|3019}}: [[Gandalf]] returning to life, and the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]-sequence. Since it is clear from the narrative that the latter event occurred one day before departure on [[16 February]], this causes a problem in the chronology. [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] decided to fix the Tale of Years so that the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]-sequence happened on [[15 February]]. The return to life of Gandalf was also moved to this date, for reasons unclear.
