'''Daeron''' was a [[Sindar|Sindarin]] [[Elves|Elf]] who dwelt in [[Doriath]] as the loremaster and [[Minstrels|minstrel]] of King [[Thingol]] during the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> He was also a skilled linguist and invented the [[Cirth]] alphabet<ref>{{App|Cirth}}</ref> in {{YT|1300}}.<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 106</ref>

==History==
When [[Fingolfin]], King of the [[Noldor]], held his great feast near the [[Pools of Ivrin]] only two came out of Doriath to attend, Daeron and [[Mablung]], sent by King Thingol as messengers.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

Daeron loved [[Lúthien]], daughter of Thingol and [[Melian]] the [[Maiar|Maia]], but she did not love him. Nevertheless they were good friends, and Lúthien would often dance to his music.  After Daeron found out about Lúthien's love for the mortal [[Beren]], he betrayed them both to Thingol. When Lúthien later sought his help in assisting captive Beren, Daeron again betrayed her to Thingol, though this time in love and fear for her rather than jealousy.

After Lúthien departed in secret from Doriath, Daeron repented and set out to search for her. He never did find her and never returned to Doriath either, passing over the [[Ered Luin]] into the East where he apparently dwelt long after.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Daeron is mentioned as one of the greatest minstrels of all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and only [[Maglor]] son of [[Fëanor]] is said to come close to his skill.  Also in the [[Lay of Leithian]] there is named one called [[Tinfang Gelion]] who is counted among the three great minstrels, along with Maglor and Daeron.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the [[Sindarin]] word ''daer'' ("large, great").<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 11</ref>

In the earlier [[Etymologies]] the [[Doriathrin]] name is given as '''Dairon''' shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, ''dai''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 354 entry [[DAY]]</ref>

Consequently, [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', that the name perhaps included the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[dae]]'' "shadow".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
{{Pronounce|Daeron.mp3|Ardamir}}
In earlier versions of the mythology as set out in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Daeron was originally envisioned as Lúthien's brother.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, p. 10</ref>  Daeron's name went through a number of changes before [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] settled upon the final form - first it was ''Kapalen'', then ''Tifanto'', then ''Dairon'', before Daeron.<ref>{{LT2|In}}, Note 9, p. 49</ref>
