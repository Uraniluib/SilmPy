'''They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard''' is a music video made by Erwin Beekveld. It is a mix of footage from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]] and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]. The song is formed around the phrase, uttered by [[Legolas]], "They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard". This line is spoken in The Two Towers, when Legolas spots the [[Uruk-hai]] and extrapolates their objective from the direction in which they run. It should be noted that Legolas states the Uruks turned north-east - a direction which would not lead them to Isengard, but straight back at the pursuers. The actual direction should be north-west.

The lyrics are scrambled lines from Legolas, [[Gollum]] and [[Celeborn]]. Footage of [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] is also shown. The music is a computerized mix of two themes of [[Howard Shore]]'s music; the "Shire" theme and the "Fellowship" theme.
