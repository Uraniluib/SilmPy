== Summary ==
This letter was written to Tolkien's son [[Michael Tolkien (b. 1920)|Michael]] at [[The Oratory School|boarding school]]. Tolkien consoled his son about not yet being on the school rugby team, relating how he too was initially rejected for being too light but "decided to make up for weight by (legitimate) ferocity", and ended up on the team and 'with colours'. He also encouraged Michael to keep an eye on his younger brother [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]].
