==Summary==
Remember your guardian angel, exhorted Tolkien, she was not a plump lady with swan-wings!  As free-willed creatures we are able to face God but He is also behind us to support and nourish us, and the angel was there to help.

Tolkien recommended that Christopher make a habit of the "praises", which he used in Latin, listing his favorites.<ref group="note">One he listed was the Litany of Loretto with the prayer ''Sub tuum præsidium''.  Tolkien created a Quenya translation of the prayer called "[[Ortírielyanna]]".</ref>
