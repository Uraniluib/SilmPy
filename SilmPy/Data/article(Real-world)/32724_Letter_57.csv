==Summary==
Tolkien had seen the Lewis brothers the day before and lunched with C.S. Lewis.  The indefatigable Lewis read part of a new story and put pressure on him that Tolkien needed to finish his.  Tolkien said he would respond but "vacation" was half gone and the examinations wood only just cleared.
