'''Heren Hyarmen''' ('''Order of the South''') is the first official [[Tolkien Society]]-affiliated Smial in Latin America. It was founded on [[19 March]] [[1989]] by [[Ronald Kyrmse]], in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The name was changed on [[9 January]] [[2003]] to "Heren Hyarmeno", the correct Quenya genitive to mean "Order of the South".<ref name="Marq">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://tolkienbrasil.com/artigos/heren-hyarmeno-fas-tolkien-brasil-comecou-ate-2003-ronald-kyrmse/ Heren Hyarmeno and Tolkien Fans in Brasil - How it began ... until 2003|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkienbrasil.com/ tolkienbrasil.com]|accessed=19 May 2015}}</ref>

The official correspondence with [[The Tolkien Society]] elicited the following reply:

{{blockquote|As far as I know, the Heren Hyarmen is the first Smial in Latin America. However, you cannot lay claim to being the first in the Southern Hemisphere as there have been two in Australia over the past 12 years. Both have not survived to this day, so at the moment your smial is the ONLY one in the Southern Hemisphere!|<ref name="Marq"/>}}
