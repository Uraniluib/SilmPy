'''Tolkien Quest''' (TQ) was a series of solo adventure paperback books (similar to the later ''[[Middle-earth Quest]]'') based on the ''QuestGame'' System, published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].

This range was quickly withdrawn due to a copyright dispute (and, according to [[Pete Fenlon]], was a major contribution to the financial troubles of ICE culminating in their loss of the [[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]] license).<ref>[http://www.tolkienguide.com J.R.R.
