==From the publisher<ref>Press release from Harm J. Schelhaas, the international liaison of the [[Dutch Tolkien Society]] Unquendor.</ref>==

The proceedings of the 5th Unquendor Lustrum Conference 2006 are now available, published in a special Lembas Extra issue. The 2006 Lustrum celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Dutch Tolkien Society Unquendor. Ron Pirson PhD and Dorine Ratulangie MA invited several scholars who contributed to studies or art in a Tolkien context: Professor Cor Blok, guest of honour of the Lustrum Conference, Professor Arne Zettersten, Renee Vink MA, Professor Nils Ivar Agoy, and Johan Vanhecke MA. The papers they presented are included in this Lembas Extra.

As a tribute we have included one of the papers Ron Pirson PhD wrote in Dutch on Tolkien. He initiated the organisation of the Lustrum Conference. His illness and his passing in 2006 saddened us all. This Lembas Extra is dedicated to him.

Lembas Extra is available at the Dutch Tolkien Society Unquendor (www.unquendor.nl) and the Tolkienwinkel (www.tolkienwinkel.nl).
