'''''Mr. Bliss''''' is an illustrated children's story [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], first published posthumously in [[1982]]. The story tells of Mr Bliss's purchase of a car, and the misadventure that follows his poor driving: he encounters several neighbours, three bears, an angry shop-owner, and his own pet the "Girabbit". 

The story was likely written down in the early 1930s, is fully illustrated by Tolkien, with his own calligraphic handwriting integral to the design; it was first submitted for publication in [[1936]] but the cost of reproducing the artwork made it prohibitively expensive. Tolkien endeavoured to redraw it, but never got around to it; it was finally published in 1982, and in 2007 it was rescanned and republished to a higher quality.

==Plot==
Mr Bliss lives with his pet Girabbit in a white house with red roofs. Girabbit informs Mr Bliss that it will be a "fine day" so he decides to buy a yellow car, with red wheels, from Mr Binks for five shillings and sixpence; forgetting his purse, Mr Bliss leaves his silver bicycle with Mr Binks as collateral. However, on his way to visit the Dorkinses, Mr Bliss proves to be a careless driver, driving into Mr Day and breaking his barrow of carriages, and then round the next corner driving into Mrs Knight and breaking her donkey cart of bananas. He gives a lift to both Mr Day and Mrs Knight, with the donkey tied at the back.

When they reach the wood, they encounter three bears: Archie, Bruno and Teddy. After scaring the group, the three bears use the donkey to carry the cabbages and bananas and hide them in the wood for themselves. When they return, they insist on joining Mr Bliss in visiting the Dorkinses as they "could know them". Rolling down the Hill from the Wood they crash into the Dorkinses' garden wall with Mr Bliss, Mr Day, Mrs Knight and the three bears landing right in the middle of the Dorkinses' picnic, with Archie landing in their soup-terrine; the donkey flew up in the air and landed in the car. The Dorkins brothers - Fattie, Albert, Herbert and Egbert - were angry at their picnic being ruined, but the group stayed for lunch, whilethe bears went off for a walk and ate all the cabbages, apples and potatoes in the kitchen-garden. Furious, Albert Dorkins set the dogs on the bears.

The bears run off anyway saying they have bananas and cabbages; Mr Day and Mrs Knight want their cabbages and bananas back, but Mr Bliss only agrees to join them if the Dorkinses come with the dogs. Mr Bliss, Mr Day, Mrs Knight, the four Dorkineses and their dogs, travel in the car which is pulled by the donkey and three horses owned by the Dorkinses (Fattie Dorkins was too fat to own a horse). At the Cross Roads they stop at the inn for tea (and the bill for it all goes to Mr Bliss), and they then reach Three Bears Wood at dusk. The dogs track the bears but they have painted themselves to look like "bogies, or ghosts, or [[goblins]], or all three" and Mr Bliss runs off in terror. The bears start laughing and everyone else goes to the Bears' House for supper - eating cold chicken, ham, lettuces, beetroot, trifle, cheese, brown bread, and asparagus - and they all stay the night.

However, Mr Bliss ran away during the night and by the morning he had reached the village. He recovered his bicycle from Mr Binks's shed without paying for the car, so Mr Binks tried to persuade Sergeant Boffin to lock Mr Bliss up as a thief; the bears, the Dorkinses, Mr Day and Mrs Knight all arrive in the village determined to get money from Mr Bliss for the various expenses incurred, so they join Mr Binks and Serjeant Boffin in going to Mr Bliss's house. But, when they arrived at Mr Bliss's houses they were scared away by a Girabbit that was so big its head stuck out from the chimney. After everyone has left, Mr Bliss settled all his debts, and then gaves the car to Mr Day as wedding present in his marriage to Mrs Knight; everyone attended the wedding, including the Girabbit. Afterwards, Mr Bliss drives a donkey-cart instead, his only worry is children trespassing in his garden to try to see the Girabbit.

==History==
According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]] in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', the story was inspired by Tolkien's own driving mishaps following the purchase of his first car in [[1932]],<ref name="Bio217">{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 217-8</ref> however Joan Tolkien ([[Michael Tolkien]]'s wife) asserts that it was based on a toy car that was [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s most cherished toy, with the three bears based on three teddy boys owned by Tolkien's own sons.<ref>"Letters" in ''The Times'', [[10 October]] 1982, p. 25</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggests from the handwriting it is more likely to be 1930s than 1920s.<ref name="RG788">{{CG|RG}}, p. 788</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] thought that it was likely to have been produced in a short summer break, and suggest the summers of [[1929]], [[1930]] or [[1931]] as the most likely candidates.<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 86</ref> However, in a holiday to Cornwall in 1932 Tolkien named a local character "[[Gaffer Gamgee]]" which Hammond and Scull acknowledge indicates a later date.<ref name="RG788" />

Following the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', in 1936 Tolkien submitted ''Mr. Bliss'' to [[Allen and Unwin]] alongside ''[[Roverandom]]'', ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' and "[[The Lost Road]]".<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 244</ref> The publishers seriously and realistically considered publication, but the cost of reproducing the images would be too expensive, so the publishers asked Tolkien to redraw them in a simpler style; although he wasn't sure he could improve it<ref>{{L|31}}</ref> and hoped the publishers could find another artist,<ref>{{L|23}}</ref> Tolkien agreed<ref>{{L|10}}</ref> although he never found the time to do so.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 217-8</ref> The original manuscripts - alongside those of ''The Hobbit'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''Farmer Giles of Ham'' - were sold to [[Marquette University]] in [[1957]] for £1,250.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 299</ref> [[Clyde S. Kilby]] became aware of the ''Mr. Bliss'' in [[1964]] and, once again, Tolkien and [[Rayner Unwin]] considered publication but, again, felt that the artwork needed reproducing in order to be published.<ref name="RG789">{{CG|RG}}, p. 789</ref>

Following Tolkien's death in 1973, [[Christopher Tolkien]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] worked to release Tolkien's unpublished materials. ''Mr. Bliss'' was published by George Allen and Unwin in 1982 exactly as Tolkien drew, with typeset text opposite Tolkien's original drawings;<ref>[[J.R.R.

==Reception==
When Tolkien first submitted ''Mr. Bliss'' for publication, Charles Furth of Allen and Unwin said it was in a class with ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.<ref name="RG788" /> Tolkien's biographer, ''[[Humphrey Carpenter]]'', said it "owes a little to [[wikipedia:Beatrix Potter|Beatrix Potter]] ''[author-illustrator of ''[[wikipedia:The Tale of Peter Rabbit|The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'']'' in its ironical humour and to [[wikipedia:Edward Lear|Edward Lear]] in the style of its drawings, though Tolkien's approach is less grotesque and more delicate than Lear's."<ref name="Bio217"/> In a review in [[Amon Hen 59|''Amon Hen'' 59]], Jessica Yates also compares the book to the works of Beatrix Potter: "As a children's picture book it may well be compared to Beatrix Potter's work in presentation, with its high ratio of picture to text, in its rural English setting, and mix of human and animal characters" but the role of the narrator to [[wikipedia:Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[wikipedia:Just So Stories|Just So Stories]]''.<ref>"Reviews" in [[Amon Hen 59|''Amon Hen'' 59]] (December 1982), p. 6</ref>

[[Tom Shippey]] also remarked on the rural setting of "a vanished England where everybody did - and spoke - exactly as they pleased, and life was consequently a series of amiable anrupt collisions" and compares it to [[wikipedia:Kenneth Grahame|Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[wikipedia:The Wind in the Willows|The Wind in the Willows]]''<ref>"Blunt Belligerence" in ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 November 1982, p. 1306</ref> [[Jared Lobdell]] also compared ''Mr. Bliss'' to both The Wind in the Willows - and Toad's driving a car - and suggested that "Lear's ''[[wikipedia:Book of Nonsense|Book of Nonsense]]'' is among Mr. Bliss's spiritual progenitors".<ref>"Mr. Bliss: Notes on the Manuscript and Story" in ''[[Selections from the Marquette J.R.R. Tolkien Collection]]'', p. 7</ref>

Hammond and Scull describe the work as eccentric which "defies classification" that shows Tolkien's "remarkable originality as an author";<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkienestate.com/en/writing/tales-for-children/mr-bliss.html|articlename=Mr. Bliss|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]|website=[http://www.tolkienestate.com Tolkien Estate]|accessed=26 December 2018}}</ref> "it is unusual among Tolkien works in that it is a picture book for children, in which words and art are equally important, rather than a story with illustrations".<ref name="RG788">{{CG|RG}}, p. 787</ref> Also writing in ''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]'', Joseph Houghton compared the story with ''[[Letters from Father Christmas|The Father Christmas Letters]]'', particularly the [[North Polar Bear]] and the [[Orcs#Other writings|goblin]] attack.<ref>"Reviews" in [[Amon Hen 59|''Amon Hen'' 59]] (December 1982), p. 7</ref>

Average readers' scores for ''Mr. Bliss'' are fairly consistent in praise. On [http://www.goodreads.com Goodreads] it received an average score of 3.82/5 (7.64),<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.goodreads.com Goodreads]|articleurl=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175203.Mr_Bliss|articlename=Mr. Bliss|accessed=26 December 2018}}</ref> while [http://www.amazon.com Amazon] customers were more positive, giving it a high score of 4.8/5 (9.6/10).<ref name="AMUK" />

==Adaptations==
A group of Russian fans created [[Mr. Bliss (2004)|an animated film of "Mr. Bliss"]] making use of the original drawings by Tolkien. The film was shown at both [[Tolkien Thing]] 2006 and [[Ring*Con 2006]].

As part of [[Tolkien Reading Day]] 2017, [[The Tolkien Society]] hosted a live reading of ''Mr. Bliss'' by the storyteller [http://lucywalters.uk.com/ Lucy Walters] at [[wikipedia:The Story Museum|The Story Museum]].<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/events/tolkien-reading-day-2017/|articlename=Tolkien Reading Day 2017|accessed=27 March 2017}}</ref>
