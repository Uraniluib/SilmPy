==Summary==
Covering more than six pages, Tolkien replied to several questions asked by [[Rhona Beare]]. A draft of this letter was included as [[Letter 212]].

* [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] chanted ''O Elbereth Gilthoniel'' in "[[The Choices of Master Samwise]]", whilst the rest of the book used ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]''. Tolkien admited that it was an error on his part, but can be explained as Sam's mistake, as he did not know [[Sindarin]].
* Miss Beare enquired about the meaning of ''A Elbereth Gilthoniel'' and the other phrase, ''Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima''. Tolkien translated both phrases.
* Despite the earlier enquiries, this was only dubbed "Question 1", and involved [[Glorfindel]]'s horse, [[Asfaloth]]. He was said to have a "bridle and bit", while later in the book, it was mentioned Elves rode without saddle, bridle and bit. Tolkien admitted it was an error, as the chapter was one of the earliest written. He promised to correct "bridle and bit" to "headstall" in later editions.
* Question 2 concerns [[the One Ring]]. If [[Sauron]] had the Ring, how could [[Ar-Pharazôn]] have defeated him? Tolkien explained most of it would be mentioned in the unpublished ''Downfall of Númenor'', and could not yet fully answer it. However, he did tell her that the Ring of Power fed the ''potency'' and ''potentiality'' of a ruler. Without subjects, there was nothing to rule. Ar-Pharazôn had no knowledge of the Ring, so once he had subjects, Sauron's power increased again.
* Question 3 concerns the [[Blue Wizards|two wizards]] of the [[Heren Istarion|order]] that had not been mentioned yet. Tolkien gave a vague answer that he knew little about them.
* Question 4 was about the clothing of Middle-earth, and especially the crown of Gondor. Beare wanted to know whether it was like a classic Gaulish or Viking helmet as portrayed in popular culture. Tolkien instead likened it to the Egyptian pharaohs. Like the Númenorean realms, the [[Arnor|North Kingdom]] had a diadem of Kingship, and the [[Gondor|South Kingdom]] a loft crown.
* Still as part of Question 4, Miss Beare asked what the difference was between ''El'' "Elf" and ''El'' "Star", and whether inhabitants of Middle-earth would have known the difference. Tolkien replied that the two words came from the same root,  but that outside of personal names, the difference was distinct as both were shortened forms. 
* Also as part of Question 4, Tolkien gave the translation of ''[[Legolas]]'' as "Green foliage".
* Miss Beare asked about the [[Fell beasts|winged steed]] of the [[Witch-king]], and whether it was like a pterodactyl. Tolkien replied that it wasn't, but that it may have been a survivor of older geological eras.
* Question 5 concerned the mention of the "Elder King"; was he [[Ilúvatar|the One]]? Tolkien told her that it was a nickname of [[Manwë]], and most [[Valar]] were addressed by such nicknames. Eru himself did not inhabit any part of Eä. 

Tolkien ended the letter saying that he intended to write a mythical story, not some sort of new religion or vision. He had based Middle-earth on the mythical concepts ''Middan-geard'' and ''oikoumenē'', that was, a world in which Men lived as opposed to higher powers. Theologically, it was more a collection of various concepts than an outright allegory of anything.
