__NOTOC__
==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The official Tolkien calendar, this year containing 16 magnificent landscape paintings by renowned artist Ted Nasmith, selected from ‘The Silmarillion’ by J.R.R. Tolkien.<br/><br/>J R R Tolkien’s SILMARILLION is the core work of the Middle-earth canon. It is in this complex masterpiece that the history and background for THE HOBBIT and, particularly, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is documented.<br/><br/>It contains fabulous tales of heroes and monsters, and the history of the Elves and of the Silmarils – the magical jewels produced by one of the greatest of the Elves, which were stolen by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord; it tells of the creation of Middle-earth, and the coming of Men into the world; it chronicles the early battles between good and evil, forces of light and dark, which foreshadow the great conflict with Sauron in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It also includes a version of the tale of the Children of Húrin, and Túrin’s titanic confrontation with the mighty dragon, Glaurung, the agent of Morgoth.<br/><br/>These tales of Middle-earth were published posthumously in 1977, and when the book was recently reset, acclaimed Tolkien artist Ted Nasmith was commissioned to produce a total of almost 50 breathtaking paintings to accompany these spectacular stories.<br/><br/>It is from these that the new Tolkien Calendar has been complied, and it promises to be one of the most beautiful collections ever published..}}
