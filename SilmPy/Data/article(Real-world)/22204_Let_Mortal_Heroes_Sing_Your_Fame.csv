'''''Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame''''' is the fifth full length album by [[Summoning]]. It is their first album to make extensive use of audio samples (taken from radio productions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''), giving the album a slight dramaturgic bent.
