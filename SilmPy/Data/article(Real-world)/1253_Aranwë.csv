'''Aranwë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[aˈranwe]}}; from ''[[aran]]'' = "king") was an [[Noldor|Elf]] of the [[House of Fingolfin]]. Though not much is known about him for sure, he seems to have been a nobleman of [[Gondolin]] (at least, his name means "Noble One", and his son [[Voronwë]] came from King [[Turgon]]'s [[Hidden City]]).<ref name="Tuor">{{UT|1}}</ref>
