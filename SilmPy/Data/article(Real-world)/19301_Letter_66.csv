==Summary==
Tolkien expressed some comments about the slow airgraph system. The Professor and his son wrote a lot, but since their letters arrived late, they could not reply properly. He then related some memories of training camp, and comments about the war. He saw the war as a battle against [[Sauron]] with the [[The One Ring|Ring]], but somehow they are winning it. The penalty for this war was, however, creating new Saurons, and turning [[Men]] and [[Elves]] into [[Orcs]]. He saw his son as "a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] among the [[Uruk-hai|Urukhai]]".

The next topic was the current state of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', where a new character had entered the scene: ''"(I am sure I did not invent him, I did not even want him, though I like him, but there he came walking into the woods of [[Ithilien]]): [[Faramir]], brother of [[Boromir]]"''.  Tolkien reported that there had been a battle, which included a monstrous [[Oliphaunts|Oliphaunt]], but he looked forward to getting [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] to [[Cirith Ungol|Kirith Ungol]] at last.
