The '''Little Kingdom''' was a minor realm within the confines of what is now [[England]] that existed during a dark period of its history.  It was the realm of the legendary King Ã†gidius Draconarius, who started out in life as [[Farmer Giles]] of [[Ham]]. The realm was separated from [[Augustus Bonifacius]]'s earlier [[Middle Kingdom]].

According to the translator of the story, ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', the boundaries of the Little Kingdom are difficult to determine from the scanty evidence.  The events of the legend seem to have taken place in the valley of the Thames, with an excursion north-west to the walls of Wales.  The kingdom apparently never reached far up the Thames into the West, nor beyond Otmoor to the North, and its eastern borders are dubious.  Its capital was evidently in its south-east corner.

The Little Kingdom may have existed "after the days of King Coel, but before Arthur or the Seven Kingdoms of the English".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Foreword</ref>
