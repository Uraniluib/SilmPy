'''Malach Aradan''' ({{FA|307}}-{{FA|398|n}}<ref name="Hador">{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador''</ref>) was the son and heir of [[Marach]] of the Third House of the [[Edain]], and the ancestor of the [[House of Hador]] and its descendants. <ref name="Swest">{{S|West}}</ref>

==History==
Malach was the son of Marach and older brother of [[Imlach]]. He had settled with his folk in [[Estolad]], with the people of [[Bëor]].

The kings of the [[Noldor]] welcomed the [[Edain]] and in response many young men took service with kings and lords of the [[Eldar]].  Malach himself left Estolad for [[Hithlum]], the realm of the Elven High-king [[Fingolfin]] of the [[Noldor]], where he spent fourteen years ({{FA|322}}-{{FA|336|n}}) with the [[Elves]], he learned to speak [[Sindarin]], and was given the name '''''Aradan'''''<ref name="Swest"/> (Sindarin for "Noble Man"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>).

After his time in Hithlum, Aradan married [[Zimrahin]] in {{FA|337|n}} who later took the [[Sindarin]] name of ''[[Meldis]]''. Zimrahin Meldis bore Malach Aradan two children: the eldest child was an only daughter [[Adanel]] and the youngest child was an only son [[Magor]]<ref name="Hador"/>.  Aradan led many of the people of the Third House further west.  Some (following Aradan's son, [[Magor]]) moved into the vales of the southern slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]].<ref name="Swest"/>

==Etymology==
'''Aradan''' was the name given to '''[[Malach]]''' in [[Hithlum]] when he went to serve the Kings of the [[Noldor]]. The name means "Noble Man" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[ara]]-'' = "noble" and ''[[adan]]'' = "[[Edain|Man]]").<ref name="Swest"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally it was [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]] who led the people of the third house of the Edain across the Ered Luin into Beleriand; when this was changed so that Marach became the earliest leader then Malach was added to the ancestors of Hador.<ref name="Hador"/>
