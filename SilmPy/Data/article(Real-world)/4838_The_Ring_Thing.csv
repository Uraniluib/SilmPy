'''The Ring Thing''' is a Swiss German film parody of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Plot==

The entire movie is recorded in the alps of Switzerland. The  most renowned of these is the Matterhorn near Zermatt. In the movie it most clearly resembles Mount Doom, also known as Mount Chronos.

In the story the Dark Lord Sauraus wants to bring the whole world under his dominion. To accomplish this he is cooking an enormous Fondue in Mount Chronos. When that is done he is going to overbake the world with cheese.

Sauraus wasn't initially a Dark Lord but a normal knight. He went mad because all of the 7 rings of power were sold out and because he was only given a coupon.

But Sauraus forges (in terms of cutting it out of cheese) his own ring. In a battle a figure resembling Isildur can take his ring from him. But he can't handle the ring and gets addicted to drugs.
This is where Stinker (Gollum parody) comes in. He steals the ring from its owner and escapes.

To stop Sauraus the known fellowship begins its quest. Leader is always the mage Alm Gandy. An ''Alm'' is in German a high located meadow. The ringbearer is a former bank accountant named Freddy but during the whole movie is called Frido by his fellows.
