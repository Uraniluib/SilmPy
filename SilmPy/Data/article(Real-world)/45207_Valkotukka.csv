'''Valkotukka''' was a minor character in [[The Father Christmas Letters]]. He was a polar bear cub. Valkotukka had a brother named [[Paksu]], and he was the nephew of the [[North Polar Bear]].<ref>[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[The Father Christmas Letters]]</ref>

== History ==
Valkotukka, along with Paksu, came for a visit one Christmas to visit their uncle and [[Father Christmas]]. The two never left.

Valkotukka, just like his brother, was mischievous and naughty, to the extent that Father Christmas wrote of them; "they seem to be growing up just like their uncle."
