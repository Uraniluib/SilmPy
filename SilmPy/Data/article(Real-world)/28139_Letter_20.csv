==Summary==
This letter is a reply to C.A. Furth of [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] who had written to tell Tolkien about a minor crisis at the publishers' precipitated by the volume of Christmas orders for ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Tolkien thanks Mr Furth for his letter and for the copies of ''The Hobbit'' he had received [[Letter 19|as requested]]. He discusses some emendations he would like made to text of the next edition, fixing some errors that have been pointed out to him by 'humble hobbit-fancier' Mr [[Wikipedia:Arthur Ransome|Arthur Ransome]] (the inappropriate use of ''man''/''men'' to refer to hobbits and dwarves in a few places).<ref group=note>For the correspondence between Tolkien and Ransome, see letter [[Letter to Arthur Ransome]].</ref>

Of chief 'historical' interest is the closing line:
{{blockquote|I have written the first chapter of a new story about Hobbits &ndash; 'A long expected party'. A merry Christmas.}}
