==Summary==
Tolkien wrote to [[Stanley Unwin]] concerning a request made by Rütten & Loening Verlag. This German publishing house had enquired about a possible German translation, and asked Tolkien for a ''Bestätigung'', a confirmation that he was Aryan. Tolkien asked Unwin whether they do this for all people of which they want to translate a work, or if it was because of his German sounding name. Though he could provide such confirmation, he refused to do so. 

He had set up [[Letter 30|two drafts]] in reply to Rütten & Loening, and asked Unwin for his opinion, as he did not want to close the door on a German translation without Unwin's consent.
