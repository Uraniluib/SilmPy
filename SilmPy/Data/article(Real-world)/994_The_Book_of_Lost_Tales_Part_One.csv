'''''The Book of Lost Tales Part One''''' is the first volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. It describes the beginning of the conception of [[Middle-earth]] and [[Valinor]]. The Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Embedded in English legend and [[Old English]] association, they are set in the narrative frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named [[Eriol]] (or [[Ælfwine]]) to [[Tol Eressëa]], the "Lonely Isle", where Elves dwelt; from them he learned their true history, the ''Lost Tales of Elfinesse''. In the Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of [[Valar|Gods]] and [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]]; of the [[Silmarils]] and the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]; of [[Nargothrond]] and [[Gondolin]]; and of the geography and cosmology of the invented world.
