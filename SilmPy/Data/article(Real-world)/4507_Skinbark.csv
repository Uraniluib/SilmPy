'''Skinbark''' (also known as '''Fladrif''') was, with [[Treebeard]] and [[Leaflock]], one of the three oldest [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]].  He lived on the slopes above and to the west of [[Isengard]], and so he and his people suffered the most at the hands of [[Saruman]]'s despoiling [[Orcs]].  After many of his folk and tree-herds had been destroyed and he had been wounded, Skinbark moved high up the slopes to be with the [[birches]] he most loved and would not come down.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==Etymology==

Tolkien wrote that ''Skinbark'' is the [[Westron|Common Speech]] (or English) translation of ''Fladrif''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 763</ref> It appears like ''Fladrif'' is intended to be [[Sindarin]];<ref name=DW/> the name is mentioned together with the Sindarin name ''[[Nindalf]]'' as acquiring the /v/ sound by the final ''-f''.<ref>{{App|E1i }}</ref> [[Didier Willis]] has suggested that ''Fladrif'' is composed of the otherwise unattested words *''flâd'' ("skin") and *''rîf'' ("bark").<ref name=DW>{{webcite|author=[[Didier Willis]]|articleurl=http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html|articlename=Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary|dated=|website=[http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com]|accessed=19 March 2012}}</ref>
