==Summary==
Tolkien had received a copy of ''Light on C.S. Lewis'' and hoped that Kilby had too.  Interesting, said Tolkien, but it missed one of the essential points of his temperament.  [[Owen Barfield|Barfield]] came nearest in Tolkien's view.  Tolkien had to leave his comment enigmatic as he did not have time to enlarge it.
