==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|In this book, the shaping of the chronological and geographical structure of the legends of [[Middle-earth]] and [[Valinor]] is spread before us. We are introduced to the hitherto unknown [[Ambarkanta]] or 'Shape of the World', the only account ever given of the nature of the imagined [[Eä|Universe]], accompanied by maps and diagrams of the world before and after the cataclysms of The War of the Gods and the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. The first map of [[Beleriand]] is also reproduced and discussed. In [[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|The Annals of Valinor]] and [[Annals of Beleriand|The Annals of Beleriand]] we are shown how the chronology of the [[First Age]] was moulded; and the tale is told of [[Ælfwine]], the Englishman who voyaged into the [[Aman|True West]] and came to [[Tol Eressëa]], the [[Tol Eressëa|Lonely Isle]], where he learned the ancient history of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. Also included are the original '[[The Silmarillion#Development of the text|Silmarillion]]' of 1926, and the [[Quenta Noldorinwa]] of 1930 - the only version of the myths and legends of the First Age that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] completed to their end.}}
