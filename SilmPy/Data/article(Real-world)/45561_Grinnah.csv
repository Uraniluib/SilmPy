'''Grinnah''' was a [[Orcs|Goblin]] of [[Goblin-town]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''. He was played by [[Stephen Ure]], who also played [[Fimbul]].

==History==
Grinnah appeared to be a significant member of the Goblin Army, as he directly reported to the [[Great Goblin]] when they captured [[Thorin and Company]]. He discovers [[Orcrist]] on [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]], and shows it to the great goblin, who angrily orders his subordinates to kill Thorin. When [[Gandalf]] arrived to rescue the Dwarves and they took up arms to fight their way out, Grinnah was stabbed to death by [[Kíli]].<ref>''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''</ref>
==Personality==
Grinnah is cunning and vicious, but much like the other goblins, he is a coward. Despite his apparent loyality to the great goblin, he actually hates him in secret.<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.theonering.com The One Ring]|articleurl=http://www.theonering.com/complete-list-of-film-changes/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey|articlename=An Unexpected Journey﻿|accessed=1 July 2017}}</ref>
