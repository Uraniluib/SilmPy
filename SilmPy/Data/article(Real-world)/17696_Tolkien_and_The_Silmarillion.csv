'''''Tolkien and The Silmarillion''''' is a book by [[Clyde S. Kilby]], which describes Kilby's interaction with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the summer of [[1964]], and his reading of the manuscript of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the first "outsider" to see it. Kilby also writes about Tolkien's friendship with [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams]].

The book includes an inscription written by Tolkien in a copy of ''Perelandra'' by [[C.S. Lewis]]. Also included are extracts from numerous letters (see [[Letter to Clyde S. Kilby (unknown date)]], [[Letter to Joan O. Falconer]] and [[Letter to Roger Verhulst (9 March 1966)]]) and references to conversations between Tolkien and Kilby.

==From the publisher==
J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Silmarillion'' has been one of the most eagerly awaited books of this century. It tells the story of Middle Earth (''sic'') before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Clyde Kilby spent a summer working with Tolkien on the manuscript of ''The Silmarillion''. In this book he describes that time. He builds up a fascinating portrait of Professor Tolkien, his work as a Christian writer, and his friendship with [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Charles Williams]] and the rest of 'The [[Inklings]]'.

Originally, a synopsis of ''The Silmarillion'' was to be included, but this was removed at the request of [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The summary was subsequently published in VII: An Anglo-American Literary Review, Volume 19, 2002.
