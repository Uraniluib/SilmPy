==Summary==
[[Geoffrey Bache Smith]] had sent Tolkien a letter from fellow [[T.C.B.S.|Barrovian]] [[Christopher Wiseman]]. After the death of [[Robert Gilson]], Wiseman wondered whether the T.C.B.S. still had any purpose.  Tolkien thought so, and went on to tell Smith about his ideas of friendship. He remarked of [[World War I|the War]]: "[it] is for all the evil of our own side with large view good against evil".
