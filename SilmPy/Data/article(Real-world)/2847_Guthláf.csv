'''Guthláf''' was the banner-bearer of King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]].

==History==
He rode to the relief of [[Minas Tirith]] with his Lord in the [[War of the Ring]], and there fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was slain.  He fell with the banner in his hand, and it had to be taken from him after death to be given to [[Éomer]].  He also earned himself a mention in the ''[[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]]''.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In [[Old English]] ''Guþláf'' means "survivor of the battle" (consisting of ''[[Wiktionary:guþ#Old_English|gūþ]]'' + ''[[Wiktionary:laf#Old_English|lāf]]'').<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 181</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Guthláf can be found at the lumber camp in the Eastfold area of the West Rohan region. He is the son of Thane Sparhafoc of [[Fenmark|Fenmarch]]. He has been dismissed from his duty as Theoden's banner-bearer by [[Gríma]], but he is expecting to be returned to the king's service soon.
