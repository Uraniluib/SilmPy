'''''The Grey Mountains''''' is a campaign supplement for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'', 1st Edition.

== Cover/Jacket Text == 

Forming the northern border of the Rhovanion and Mirkwood, the Grey Mountains span four hundred miles: from Angmar's Witch-realm to the Iron Hills. Shot through with Dwarven mines, Orc warrens and Dragon caves, the Ered Mithrin are a cold and foreboding ranges. They promise treasure and adventure, but more often deliver an untimely demise to explorers. Take your Middle-earth campaign to the edge of the chill Forodwaith and send your players across the deadly Withered Heath; just beware of Dragons!

*17" x 22" Full-Color Map depicting the Grey Mountains range and Northern Rhovanion. 
*9 Challenging Adventures, including a 4-adventure mini-campaign. These travails take explorers from one end of the Grey Mountains to the other. 
*Detailed Layouts of the Dwarven city, Norr Dum, the Ice-orc fortress, Kala Dulakurth, and numerous other haunts scattered throughout this imposing mountain range. 
*In-depth Information on the Dragons and Dwarves of the Grey Mountains and the Withered Heath. 
*Stats and Background Information on numerous personalities and beasts who wander the frigid north of Middle-earth.
