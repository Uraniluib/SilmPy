==Copyright infringement accusation==
In March 2012 it drew international attention after it was accused of copyright infringement by [[Middle-earth Enterprises]].<ref name="BBC1">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-17350103|articlename=Hobbit pub in Southampton threatened with legal action|dated=13-March-2012|website=BBC|accessed=23-March-2012}}</ref> In response, a "Save The Hobbit" campaign was established.<ref name="FB1">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/SaveTheHobbitSouthampton|articlename=Save The Hobbit, Southampton|website=Facebook|accessed=23-March-2012}}</ref> This caught the attention of [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]] cast members [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Ian McKellen]], who both criticised the action taken by [[Saul Zaentz|Saul Zaentz's]] company.<ref name="BBC2">{{webcite|articleurl=

On his website, Ian McKellen commented:
{{Blockquote|With no apparent explanation they [Middle-earth Enterprises] are insisting that The Hobbit pub stop trading under that name. As if it were possible to control the way Tolkien and his characters have entered the culture. Did anyone try to ban "Gandalf for President" buttons?

Lawyers representing Middle-earth Enterprises subsequently offered The Hobbit a reprieve, saying that they would be open to giving them a license to trade as "The Hobbit" for a fee of $100 per year. Stephen Fry and Ian McKellen have since announced that they would be willing to pay this fee. Both actors hope to visit the public house once filming on ''The Hobbit'' films ends in July.<ref name="BBC3">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-17433036|articlename=Hobbit pub copyright row: Stephen Fry and Ian McKellen to pay licence|dated=21-March-2012|website=BBC|accessed=23-March-2012}}</ref>
