{{disambig-more|The Lord of the Rings|[[The Lord of the Rings (disambiguation)]]}}In [[1955]], the [[BBC|BBC Radio Third Programme]] aired a treatment of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' in six episodes. A [[1956|year later]], six episodes on ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'' followed. Though only the latter six episodes were called thus, the entire series has become known as the 1955 [[:Category:Radio adaptations|radio series]] of '''''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'''''. Each of these twelve episodes was repeated just once, almost immediately, between two and five days after its first broadcast. No recordings of this series are known to have survived. However, the scripts and some correspondence still exist.{{fact}}

==Differences from the book==
*In the first six episodes, dialogue was preserved as much as possible, but in the last six, some liberty had to be taken.<ref name="CaG">[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]] [[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide:Reader's Guide|Reader's Guide]]'', "Adaptations", pp. 8-23</ref>
* The second part of the series had to have a lot of cuts because executives at the [[BBC]] were not as fond of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as the listeners were.<ref name="CaG"/>
*'''Tom Bombadil:''' Considered by Tolkien "dreadful", though it is left unexplained why.<ref name="L175"/>
*'''[[Goldberry]]:''' She was portrayed as Bombadil's daughter.<ref name="L175"/> Tiller later apologized to Tolkien, stating he had thought the age difference between the two too large to portray them as a couple.<ref name="CaG"/>
*'''[[Old Man Willow|Willowman]]:''' He is shown in league with [[Mordor]], rather than just an antagonist of the Hobbits.<ref name="L175"/>
*'''[[Glóin]]:''' He was given a German accent. Tolkien thought he was not too bad, though a bit exaggerated.<ref name="L176">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 176]] (dated [[8 December|December 8]], [[1955]])</ref>
*'''The [[Council of Elrond]]''': Severely trimmed, only the base actions and characters remained.<ref name="CaG"/>
