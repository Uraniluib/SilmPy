'''3 Manor Road''' in Oxford was the home of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Ronald]], [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]], and [[Priscilla Tolkien]] from 1947<ref>{{L|107}}</ref> to 1950. They moved to this "tiny terraced house",<ref>{{L|241}}</ref> owned by Merton College, when their previous home, the house at [[20 Northmoor Road]] became too big and costly to maintain after the boys had moved out. But quite soon they found their new home too small: there was no room that Tolkien could use as a study. Tolkien stated that he typed out ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (once) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (twice) while sitting on a bed in the attic.<ref>{{L|257}}</ref>  Merton College promised to offer Tolkien a larger house as soon as one became available. In 1950 the Tolkiens moved to [[99 Holywell Street]].<ref>{{L|107}}, postscript</ref>
