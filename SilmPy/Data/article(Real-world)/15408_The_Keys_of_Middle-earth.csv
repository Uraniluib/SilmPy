==From the Publisher==
{{blockquote|'The Keys of Middle-Earth' introduces the reader to the world of medieval literature through the fiction of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Using key episodes in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', readers are taken back to the works of Old, Middle English, Finnish, and Old Norse literature that so influenced Tolkien. The original texts are presented with helpful new translations to help the reader approach the medieval poems and tales, and introductory essays draw on recent scholarship and Tolkien's own unpublished notes.}}
