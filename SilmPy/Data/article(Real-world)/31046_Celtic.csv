'''Celtic''' refers either to the [[Wikipedia:Celtic languages|Celtic languages]], including [[Wikipedia:Breton language|Breton]], [[Wikipedia:Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Wikipedia:Goidelic languages|Gaelic]], and [[Welsh]], or to the [[Wikipedia:Celts|Celts]], an historic group of people.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 148-52</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] had noted the ambiguity of the word "Celtic" as an arbitrary catch-all term:
{{quote|'Celtic' of any sort is, nonetheless, a magic bag, into which anything may be put, and out of which almost anything may come.|Inauguration speech at the [[University of Oxford]]<ref>{{MC|English}}</ref>}}

==Scholarly interest==

Tolkien was thanked for having helped "untiringly with problems of Celtic philology" in preparing the book ''[[Roman Britain and the English Settlements]]'' ([[1936]]).<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/othercredits.php|articlename=Other credits|dated=|website=TB|accessed=15 February 2017}}</ref>

==Celtic influences on the Legendarium==

===Mythology===
Tolkien claimed knowledge of Celtic languages and legends, but expressed a dislike in Celtic legends and denied that his legendarium is "Celtic".<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 26</ref>

However, Celtic concepts are present in some views about the [[Elves]] (see [[Elves#Celtic influence]]).

===Names===
While the [[Westron]] world displays [[North Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Old English]] elements, Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the Bree-men in [[Eriador]] resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref> Tolkien said to the Dutch Translator, [[Max Schuchart]], that there were "'[[Celtic]]' elements in [[Buckland]] and [[Eastfarthing|East-farthing]] names."<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 93</ref>

These analogies are present mostly relating to [[Pre-Númenóreans]] and the [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[hobbits]], which is evident in placenames such as "[[Bree]]" and the personal names of the [[Bucklanders]]. According to [[Paula Marmor]], the Celtic elements in [[Stoorish]] names represent [[Pre-Númenórean|an earlier language]], related to that of the [[Bree-landers]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "An etymological excursion among the Shire folk"</ref>

In the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', the majority of genuine Celtic names is seen in the family trees of the [[Brandybuck]]s. Names such as [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac]], [[Dinodas Brandybuck|Dinodas]], [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck|Gorbadoc]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]] and [[Marmadoc Brandybuck|Marmadoc]] are Celtic.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of names"</ref>

Other names having (or have been suggested as having) a Celtic influence include:
*''[[Archet#Etymology|Archet]]''
*''[[Bree#Etymology|Bree]]''
*''[[Carn Dûm#Etymology|Carn Dûm]]''
*''[[Chetwood#Etymology|Chetwood]]'' 
*''[[Carrock#Etymology|Carrock]]''
*''[[Combe#Etymology|Combe]]''
*''[[Crickhollow#Etymology|Crickhollow]]''
*''[[The Yale#Etymology|Yale]]''

Edward Crankshaw, a reader for [[Allen & Unwin]], was assigned to review the current draft of the "[[Quenta Silmarillion]]" in 1937. He had a mostly favourable attitude to it, but he said that the names were "eye-splitting Celtic names". [[Tolkien]] denied Celtic influences in his Elvish names, and he showed distaste for Celtic words.<ref>{{L|19}}</ref>
