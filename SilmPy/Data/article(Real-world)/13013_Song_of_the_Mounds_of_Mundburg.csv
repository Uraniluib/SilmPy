The '''''Song of the Mounds of Mundburg''''' was a song written by an unnamed poet of [[Rohan]] some years after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  It was about those slain in the battle, those buried at the [[Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>  It is much like the epic Welsh poem ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Gododdin Y Gododdin]'' in miniature form.

<blockquote>
We heard of the horns in the hills ringing,<br>
the swords shining in the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]],<br>
Steeds went striding to the [[Stoningland]]<br>
as wind in the morning.  War was kindled.<br>
There [[Théoden]] fell, Thengling mighty,<br>
to his [[Meduseld|golden halls]] and [[the Mark|green pastures]]<br>
in the [[Rohan|Northern fields]] never returning,<br>
high lord of the host.  [[Harding (rider of Rohan)|Harding]] and [[Guthláf]],<br>
[[Dúnhere]] and [[Déorwine]], doughty [[Grimbold]],<br>
[[Herefara]] and [[Herubrand]], [[Horn (rider of Rohan)|Horn]] and [[Fastred (rider of Rohan)|Fastred]],<br>
fought and fell there in a [[Gondor|far country]]:<br>
in the [[Mounds of Mundburg]] under mould they lie<br>
with their league-fellows, lords of [[Gondor]].<br>
Neither [[Hirluin the Fair]] to the [[Pinnath Gelin|hills]] by the [[Bay of Belfalas|sea]],<br>
nor [[Forlong the old]] to the [[Lossarnach|flowering vales]]<br>
ever, to [[Arnach]], to his own country<br>
returned in triumph; nor the tall bowmen,<br>
[[Derufin]] and [[Duilin (son of Duinhir)|Duilin]], to their [[Morthond|dark waters]],<br>
meres of [[Morthond]] under [[Erech|mountain-shadows]].<br>
Death in the morning and at day's ending<br>
lords took and lowly.  Long now they sleep<br>
under grass in Gondor by the [[Anduin|Great River]]<br>
Grey now as tears, gleaming silver,<br>
red then it rolled, roaring water:<br>
foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset;<br>
as beacons mountains burned at evening;<br>
red fell the dew in [[Rammas Echor]].</blockquote>
