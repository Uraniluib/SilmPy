This boxed collection includes four painted 28 by 28 inch color [[Maps]] by renowned [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] artist [[John Howe]], and an illustrated hardcover book by [[Brian Sibley]] explaining the importance and evolution of geography in Tolkien's work. Although the set was first printed in 1994, the maps of [[Beleriand]] and [[NÃºmenor]] have never before been published in the U.S. The set also includes maps of  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], and [[Middle-earth]]. The maps are loose inside a hard-bound folder, and can be removed for display or framing. Sibley's text offers insight into the specific role of each place name in the stories, and background on how the maps came into being. Sibley is the author of several books on Tolkien's work.
