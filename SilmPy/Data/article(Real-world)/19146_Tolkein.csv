A lot of people misspell "[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]" as '''Tolkein'''. This was already the case in Tolkien's time; several passages in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' show Tolkien's frustration about the matter. 
__NOTOC__
==History==
The first recorded use of ''Tolkein'' stems from [[1901]]. The ''Blue Book'' of [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] for January of that year includes in the list of pupils: "[''Name.''] Tolkein … … [''Initials.''] J.R.R. [''Class.''] xi [''Date of Birth.''] 3.1.92 [''Came.''] 00/3 [=third quarter of 1900] [then ''Placed.'' in class] xi [''Parent's Initials.''] Mrs. [''Address.''] 214, Alcester Road [''Business.''] Independent".<ref>''King Edward's School Blue Book, January 1901'', seen and copied in Birmingham Central Library, Local Studies & History Department, 16 August 2005</ref>

In [[1922]], [[Oxford]] bookseller [[wikipedia:Basil Blackwell|Basil Blackwell]] in ''[[Fifty New Poems for Children|Fifty New Poems for Children: An Anthology Selected from Books Recently Published]]'' included the poem ''[[Goblin Feet]]'', which he ascribed to a J.R.R. Tolkein. The name appears in the table of contents, above the poem and in the index.<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/dmiller/000454.htm Fifty New Poems for Children] at [[Pieter Collier|Tolkien Library]]</ref>

Later, the name was used, according to Tolkien, by college, bank, and lawyer's clerks,<ref name="L324">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 324]] ([[4 June|June 4]]/[[5 June|5]], [[1971]])</ref> and more or less all who wrote to him.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 347]] ([[17 December|December 17]], [[1972]])</ref>

==Origin==
The name Tolkien has often been associated with Jewry. This was in turn because the Jewry of the time had predominantly Yiddish and German names, and the Tolkien family hailed from Saxony, Germany.<ref name="L324"/> Since these Yiddish and German names often ended in ''-stein'', it may have been a hypercorrection.
