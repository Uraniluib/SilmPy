'''''A Description of the Island of Númenor''''', first chapter of the second part in the book ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', was written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. As the title indicates, it contains a description of the island of [[Númenor]], also called [[Elenna]], comprising its geography, flora, fauna and last, but not least, its people.

==Synopsis==

After a short introduction detailing the (imaginary) sources for the account itself, the author describes the shape of the island, a star with 5 promontories, called as follows:

*[[Forostar]] , the Northlands
*[[Andustar]] , the Westlands
*[[Hyarnustar]] , the Southwestlands
*[[Hyarrostar]] , the Southeastlands
*[[Orrostar]] , the Eastlands

The middle region of the island was the largest province and the most populated area:

*[[Mittalmar]] , the Inlands 

Here was [[Armenelos]], the City of Kings, as well as the sacred mountain [[Meneltarma]], where religious processions took place, 3 times per year. On its southern slope was [[Noirinan]], the Valley of the Graves. It was guarded by the eagles of [[Manwë]], one of the 2 species of birds mentioned in the chapter, the other being the ''[[Kirinki]]''. 

Starting with the Northlands, each promontory is described in turn : Forostar, where the Eagles of Manwë dwelt and where the [[Sorontil|Sorontil Mountain]] stood next to the sea. Andustar, who had 3 bays on its western side, the first being [[Andúnië]], who held the city with the same name, largest in the island and harbor for the [[Elves]] of [[Tol Eressëa|Eressëa]]. Here, the beauty of [[Eldalondë]] is described and its greatest treasures were the majestic trees: [[Oiolairë]], [[Lairelossë]], [[Nessamelda]], [[Vardarianna]], [[Taniquelassë]], [[Yavannamírë]] and [[Malinornë]]. The 2 rivers of the island, [[Nunduinë]] and [[Siril]] flowed on each side of Hyarnustar, while in Hyarrostar grew [[Laurinquë]], a tree whose only purpose was to charm the people with its beauty. Of Orrostar little is told, only that grains could be cultivated in this cold part of the island.

A description of the people follows, mostly [[Edain]] skilled in riding, shaping of terrible war weapons, especially bows and also in building of the ships used to sail towards [[Middle-earth]], the first one to succeed being [[Vëantur]]. Many of the legendary weapons were put to saving here, among them [[Dramborleg]], [[Tuor]]'s axe and the bow of [[Bregor]], as well as the [[Ring of Barahir]], the only artifact to survive [[Akallabêth]], the destruction which lead to the disappearance of the Island of Númenor.
