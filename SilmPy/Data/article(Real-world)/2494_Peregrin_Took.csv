'''Peregrin "Pippin" Took''' ([[Third Age]] 2990 - at least [[Fourth Age]] 63; 1390 - 1484 in [[Shire-reckoning]], reaching at least 94-years-old<ref name="AppB">{{App|B}}</ref>) was one of the [[Hobbits]] in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He was the youngest of the Company, being in his tweens, but grew up quickly and eventually became a Knight of Gondor. [[Elrond]], at least, seemed to doubt his capability for the quest, but Pippin proved to be a loyal and courageous friend.

==Heritage and Family==
He was born in the [[Third Age]] [[Third Age 2990|2990]] (1390 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) to [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]] and [[Eglantine Banks]], making him a great-great-grandson of [[Gerontius Took|The Old Took]]. Pippin became Thain in later years, and his father inherited the title in S.R. 1415 from [[Ferumbras Took III]] when he died without an heir. Pippin had three older sisters, [[Pearl Took]], [[Pimpernel Took]], and [[Pervinca Took]].<ref name="AppC">{{App|C}}</ref>

Through his father, Pippin was a first cousin of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] (the future [[Master of Buckland]]), the second-cousin once-removed of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and the first-cousin twice-removed of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]. He was not blood-related to [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], but Pippin's son [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]] married Sam's daughter [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]] in 1463.

==History==

===Fellowship of the Ring===
[[File:Alan Lee - Feasting with the Elves.jpg|thumb|left|"Feasting with the Elves" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
As one of the [[Conspirators]], he discovered the truth behind [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s mysterious behaviour and left [[Hobbiton]] with his friend [[Samwise Gamgee]] to [[Buckland]]. During the travel, they encountered [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] who were turned away by a company of [[Elves]] led by [[Gildor]].

In Buckland, they were joined by his kinsman and dearest friend [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Fredegar Bolger]]. It was there that Frodo learned about his friends' "conspiracy" and that they did not intend to let him leave [[The Shire]] without them. They left the Shire to meet [[Gandalf]] in [[Bree]]. Pippin's enthusiasm to accompany Frodo is the result of his adventurous 'Tookish' nature as well as his loyalty and friendship to his cousin.

The stuffiness and eeriness of [[The Old Forest]] made Pippin the most uncomfortable of the four [[Hobbits]] with him becoming more and more suspicious of the intentions of the Forest; Pippin was, however, right to be suspicious as he was trapped by [[Old Man Willow]] before being rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]]. On the way to [[Bree]], from Tom Bombadil's house, Pippin again fell into misfortune as he was trapped by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] on the [[Barrow-downs]]. 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
Whilst at [[The Prancing Pony]] Pippin began to recklessly tell the story of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s birthday and subsequent disappearance. In order to prevent information about the Ring being revealed, Frodo started to sing - during the song Frodo fell from the table and the Ring slipped upon his finger. As a result, The Prancing Pony was attacked by the [[Nazgûl]] during the night, but the four Hobbits were unharmed thanks to the mysterious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], [[Aragorn|Strider]].

When Pippin finally arrived at [[Rivendell]] he was concerned that he and Merry would be left behind whilst both Sam and Frodo get to go on the [[Quest of the Ring|Quest]]. However, his indignant attitude paid off as [[Gandalf]] believed that the friendship between Pippin and the other Hobbits would be beneficial to the Quest.

When in [[Moria]], Pippin incurred the wrath of Gandalf on two separate occasions: Pippin annoyed Gandalf with a foolish question while Gandalf was trying to open the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]]; and, when inside Moria, Pippin's curiosity got the better of him as he dropped a stone down a well which lead to the [[Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]] hearing the drums in the deep - in doing so Pippin gained the retort, "''Fool of a Took!''" from Gandalf.

===With Treebeard===
During the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Boromir]] died defending Merry and Pippin from capture by the [[Uruk-hai]] who were taking the Hobbits back to [[Saruman]] at [[Isengard]] on the mistaken belief that one of them had [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. On the journey to Isengard, Pippin displayed intelligence and resourcefulness by cutting his own bonds and leaving his [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]] from [[Lothlórien]] on the ground for Aragorn to find.

Whilst held captive, Merry and Pippin became aware that the [[Orcs|Orc]] [[Grishnákh]] had guessed that they might have the Ring, so they used Grishnákh's greed to untie them and take them away from the other Orcs. When the [[Rohirrim]] attacked the Uruk-hai, Grishnákh was killed by a spear and Merry and Pippin were able to escape into [[Fangorn Forest]] where they encountered [[Treebeard]] and the other [[Ents]].

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Wellinghall'']] Merry and Pippin struck up a friendship with Treebeard, telling him about all that had happened on their journey, whilst Treebeard told the two hobbits about the loss of the [[Entwives]](and much more besides). Treebeard decided to call an [[Entmoot]] at [[Derndingle]] to decide the Ents' next move. While the Entmoot was going on, Pippin and Merry were left in the care of a 'hasty' Ent named [[Quickbeam]] who had already decided to go to battle with the Orcs as many of his tree friends had been killed.

Merry and Pippin [[Ents#The March of the Ents|marched with the Ents]] to Isengard where the Ents killed the remaining servants of Saruman, filled the [[Ring of Isengard]] with water, and kept Saruman hostage in [[Orthanc]]. Whilst sitting on their "field of victory", Merry and Pippin were reunited with Aragorn, [[Gandalf]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] with whom they shared some [[pipe-weed]] and a meal. 

Following Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, [[Gríma]] threw the [[Orthanc-stone|palantír of Isengard]] out of the window at Gandalf which Pippin subsequently picked up. After Gandalf took it from him, Pippin remained curious about it, and later remarked to Merry about how he would like to look at it again. Unable to sleep, Pippin was finally overcome by curiosity. He stole the palantír from Gandalf's keeping while he slept, but when he looked into it, he was seen by [[Sauron]] who mistakenly believed that Pippin and the Ring were with Saruman in Isengard. After a Nazgul flew by on its [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]], Gandalf realized that war was coming soon, and he rode immediately for [[Minas Tirith]], taking Pippin with him for safe keeping.

===Guard of the Citadel===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Pippin.jpg|thumb|Pippin as a member of the Guard]]
Upon arriving in Minas Tirith, Pippin went with Gandalf to the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] and recounted Boromir's death to [[Denethor]], who was Boromir's father as well as the [[Ruling Steward]]. In return for Boromir's untimely death, Pippin decided to pledge his allegiance to the grieving [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] and so became a [[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]]. Pippin befriended [[Beregond]], of the Third Company of the Citadel, who showed him 'round the city and told him the secret passwords and ways of the city, and became good friends with Beregond's son [[Bergil]].

Denethor was amused with the Hobbit's manners, especially the way he spoke to him in a very informal and personalized familiar language, as with a close friend or social equal, since the [[Hobbitish]] dialect lacked formal forms. Denethor's servants were astonished to this view, and probably gave strength to the rumor that Pippin was of very high social rank within his own country, and soon a wild rumor circulated, that the "[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]" had promised 5,000 Hobbits to the defense of the city. 

During the [[Siege of Gondor]], Pippin was instrumental in saving [[Faramir]]'s life. After Faramir had returned from battle, he was badly wounded and suffering from the [[Black Breath]]; [[Denethor]] looked into the [[Anor-stone|palantír of Minas Tirith]] and saw the full might of [[Mordor]]. Believing that Sauron's forces would prevail in battle, Denethor ordered his servants to set a pyre so both he and Faramir could burn alive, but Pippin was able to fetch Gandalf and Beregond who were both able to help save Faramir.

After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Pippin found [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] all in a daze - due to Merry's confrontation with the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] - and took him to the [[Houses of Healing]] where he was healed by [[Aragorn]]. Pippin accompanied the forces of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] to the [[Black Gate]] where he participated in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and saved Beregond's life by slaying a [[Trolls|Troll]]. Pippin was crushed beneath the troll, but he was pulled out by [[Gimli]] who recognized his foot.

===After the War of the Ring===
[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Thain Peregrin I.jpg|thumb|Gregor Roffalski - ''Thain Peregrin I'']]
When Pippin and the other Hobbits returned to The Shire, they were enraged to see what had happened to their peaceful corner of the world. Pippin went off to [[Tookland]] to raise up the [[Took Family|Took]]s in rebellion, and when he returned for the [[Battle of Bywater]] he brought 100 strong hobbits with him. Pippin and Merry jointly commanded the Hobbit victory and their names were placed at the top of [[The Roll]] commemorating those who fought in the battle.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

Pippin and Merry were heroes, and would tell all the other hobbits the stories of their travels to far-off lands. They would often go out abroad wearing their armour (Pippin had remained a Knight of Gondor) and people thought they were lordly - a position likely enforced by their extraordinary height caused by the [[Ent-draughts]] (they were at least 4'5<nowiki>''</nowiki> tall - taller than [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]]).<ref name="Concerning">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

In {{SR|1427}} (at the age of 37), he married [[Diamond of Long Cleeve]], and they had their only known child together, [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]], three years later. In {{SR|1434}} (at the age of 44) Pippin succeeded his father [[Paladin Took II|Paladin]] by becoming the 32nd [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]], and was also made a Counsellor of the North-kingdom by King Elessar. 

In {{SR|1436}} King Elessar rode north and stayed in [[Annúminas]], and met Pippin, Merry and Sam at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. In {{SR|1452}} the King, as a gift, added the [[Westmarch]] to The Shire, and in {{SR|1455}} Pippin appointed [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]] - son-in-law of Sam - as the first [[Warden of Westmarch]]. 

As Thain, Pippin collected a library of historical information at [[Great Smials]], especially information relating to [[Númenor]] and the heirs of [[Elendil]]. It was at Great Smials that ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' was likely put together, with assistance from Merry.<ref name="Records">{{FR|Records}}</ref>

In {{SR|1484}}, at the age of 94 and having been Thain for 50 years, Pippin and Merry passed on their possessions and offices to their sons and left [[The Shire]] to visit [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]]. When they died a few years later their bodies were placed in [[Rath Dínen]]; they were later laid beside King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] following his death in [[Fourth Age 120]] ({{SR|1541}}).

==Names and Titles==
* '''Peregrin''' - [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s translation of Pippin's Westron name, and is derived from Latin and was used for people who wandered. The English word "pilgrim" is derived from the same root.<ref name="Jim Allen">[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', The Giving of Names</ref>
* '''Pippin''' - a nickname most often used by Tolkien and fans alike. A 'pet-form' related to the Westron abbreviation ''[[Razar]]''; pippin is a type of [[apples|apple]] related to the word "pip" - perhaps illustrating that Pippin was the youngest member of the Fellowship.
* '''Thain Peregrin I''' - Pippin's 'regal' name when he became the [[Thain]] of the Shire.<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>
* '''[[Razanur Tûk]]''' - Peregrin's true [[Westron]] name, and contains the elements ''[[raza]]'' "stranger", and ''[[razan]]'' "foreign", and is the name of a legendary traveller. <ref name="PM">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>
* "''Fool of a Took''" and "''Tom-fool of a Took''" - given to him by [[Gandalf]] for his often mischievous behaviour, and, in particular, for dropping a stone down the well in [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
* ''[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]'' - [[Sindarin]] for "Prince of the Halflings", a erroneous title given to Pippin by the people of [[Minas Tirith]] on the belief he must be of high importance to be travelling with Gandalf.<ref name="Minas">{{RK|V1}}</ref>
* [[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]] - the office Pippin held when he swore fealty to [[Denethor]].<ref name="Minas"/>
* Knight of Gondor - a position which Aragorn confirmed Pippin held,<ref name="Partings">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> it is unclear whether being a Guard of the Citadel equates to being a Knight or if Aragorn elevated him to that position.
* Counsellor of the North-kingdom - a position granted to Pippin when he became Thain.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>
