'''Rollin' Down the Hole''' is the ninth track of ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]''. The song is played when Bilbo and company are seen floating in barrels down the river that leads to [[Lake-town]] in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]].  The music was composed by [[Maury Laws]] and the lyric was adapted by [[Jules Bass]] from the poem "[[Roll-Roll-Roll-Roll]]."

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Heave ho! Splash plump!
Rollin' down the hole!
Heave ho! Bang bump!
Roll-roll-rollin' down the hole!

Down the dark, swift stream you go
Back to lands you once did know!
Where the forest wide and dim
Stoops in shadow grey and grim.

Heave ho! Splash plump!
Rollin' down the hole!
Heave ho! Bang bump!
Roll-roll-rollin' down the hole!

Down the dark, swift stream you go
Back to lands you once did know!
Float beyond the world of trees
Out into the whispering breeze.

Heave ho! Splash plump!
Rollin' down the hole!
Heave ho! Bang bump!
Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll
Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-rollin' down the hole!
