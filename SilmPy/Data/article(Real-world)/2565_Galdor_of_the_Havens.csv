'''Galdor''' of the Havens was an [[Elf]] who in the [[Third Age]] lived in [[Mithlond]] under [[Círdan]]. 
==History==
During the [[War of the Ring]] he was sent in an errand to [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. He was present in the [[Council of Elrond]] representing Círdan. He asked about proofs that the ring of [[Frodo Baggins|the halfling]] was indeed the [[Great Ring]], and also inquired why [[Saruman]] was not with them. It was [[Gandalf]] who answered his questions, narrating his story on how he discovered the One Ring, and Saruman's treachery.

In a later point Galdor mentioned that he knew about the figure of [[Iarwain]], and he agreed with [[Glorfindel]] that he had not the power to defy [[Sauron]] and keep the Ring from him.

Then, he agreed with Gandalf that not even the [[Sea]] could hide the Ring for ever. Galdor expected that the [[Ringwraiths]] (who were recently defeated in [[Bruinen]]) would soon return and [[Gondor]] could not stop Sauron from coming all the way to [[Lindon]] and reach the Sea. These were the last comments before Elrond decided that the only option is to destroy the Ring in [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

In late writings (see ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''), Tolkien speculated that this Galdor and [[Galdor of the Tree]] may have been the same,<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, note 1</ref> but he ultimately rejected the notion: if Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus have Fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, note 3</ref> For this reason Tolkien speculated that "Galdor" was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
: A Decipher card identifies one of the Elves at the Council of Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as Galdor. He was played by Nathan Clark.
