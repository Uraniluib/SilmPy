'''Norse mythology''' refers to the collection of the sagas of Scandinavia. Most of it is found in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda Poetic] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda Prose Edda]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] borrowed many concepts and storylines for his own Legendarium, like [[Éowyn|the Shieldmaiden]] and the names of the [[Dwarves]] (from the ''[[Völuspá]]''). Elves also appear in the Norse sagas, but they are altogether different from Tolkien's Elves; in most cases they are evil or just malevolent.
