==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
In autumn when the wind and sea 
Rejoice to live and laugh to be 
And scarce the blast that curbs the tree 
And bids before it quail and flee 

In winter when years when the years burn low 
As fire wherein no firebrands glow 
And winds disappear as they blow 
The stormy wings of snow 

The hearts of western elves burn bright 
With joy that mocks the spring 
To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring 
Music, that bites the spirit, sing 

And wind by night in northern lands 
Arose, and Lord it cried 
And drove the ships from ancient strands 
Across the streaming tide
