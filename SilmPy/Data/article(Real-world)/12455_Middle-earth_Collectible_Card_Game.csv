'''Middle-earth Collectible Card Game''' (MECCG) is a collectible card game released by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] in late [[1995]]. It is the first CCG based on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], with added content from [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]]'s [[Middle-earth Role Playing|''Middle-earth Role Playing'' game]].

The cards used in the game feature original artwork by a multitude of artists, many of them longtime Tolkien illustrators such as [[John Howe]], [[Ted Nasmith]], [[Angus McBride]], et al.

==Overview==

[[IMAGE:meccg_back.jpg|thumb|''Card back of MECCG'']]

In its basic form, it is a game for one to five players, each choosing one of the [[Istari|five wizards]] to represent themselves. A ''turn'' in the game consists of one player's wandering around Middle-earth with the help of famous characters of Middle-earth, trying to gather influence and power to aid in the battle against [[Sauron|The Dark Lord]], while another player tries to harass, and ultimately kill his ''characters'' with specific ''hazard'' cards. Then, for each player's turn, the roles change clockwise around the table (the player who was moving his characters then throws hazards at the player to his or her right). Any player may also win by acquiring and destroying [[The One Ring]] after a complicated set of events.

Later expansions have added the possibility to take the role of a [[Nazg√ªl|Ringwraith]] of [[Sauron]] ([[MELE]]), a corrupted wizard playing by his own rules ([[MEWH]]), the malevolent [[Balrogs|Balrog]] ([[MEBA]]), or even Sauron himself. The game is somewhat distinguished from most other CCG's with the use of two six-sided dice for a random factor and also by the actual map of Middle-earth, including ''regions'' your companies travel through, and ''site cards'' they visit. 

MECCG won two Origins Awards: ''Best Card Game of 1995'' for ''MECCG: The Wizards'' and ''Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game or Expansion of 1996'' for ''MECCG: The Dragons''. The game's production ended in 1999, when ICE lost the license that allowed them to use the content of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (this license was later bought by [[Decipher]], who used it to bring out another CCG, the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''). MECCG still has a relatively loyal and active fanbase of players.

===Rarity===

Like the majority of collectible card games, individual cards in MECCG occurred more or less often in a booster or starter deck (except in [[MEBA]]). To describe the rarity of a card, [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]] used a code system:

*'''R''' = Rare.   
*'''U''' = Uncommon.
*'''C''' = Common.
*'''F#''' or '''Fixed#''' = Part of a fixed set of cards (of a starter deck).

These abbreviations were often combined with second abbreviations (e.g., "CB2"). For more information on the second abbreviations, which varied in the different expansion and basic sets, see the "Card list"-sections for the individual card sets below.
