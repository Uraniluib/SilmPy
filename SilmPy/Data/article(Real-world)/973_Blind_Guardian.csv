'''Blind Guardian''' is a power metal (and more recently epic metal) band started in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, Germany. Before calling themselves Blind Guardian, the band released two demos under the name ''Lucifer's Heritage'' in 1986 and 1987. There were negotiations with the band to do soundtrack work for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] but this fell through.<ref name=high>Kenneth Morton, "[http://www.highwiredaze.com/blind.htm A New Twist in the Blind Guardian Legacy (Interview)]" at [http://highwiredaze.com/ HighwireDaze.com] (accessed 4 September 2011)</ref>

From the very beginning, Blind Guardian have been inspired by the fictional worlds of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and other fantasy authors, as well as traditional legends and epics. The 1998 album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'', for example, is a concept album based on Tolkien's ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', while the 2002 album ''A Night at the Opera'' features a 14-minute song about the Trojan War, titled "''And Then There Was Silence''." Over the years, a running theme has developed associating the band members with traveling bards.

There were plans on releasing a CD of ''The Lord of the Rings'' orchestral music in [[2008]].<ref name=high/>
