'''''Music in Middle-earth''''' is a [[2010]] book investigating the use of song and music within [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s stories. It is published as No. 20 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|From the Grand Theme that the Ainur played before Ilúvatar at the beginning of the world, to the various songs encountered or sung by the characters of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the world that J.R.R. Tolkien created contains numerous references to song and music. Indeed, musical elements form an integral part of his narratives. It is therefore surprising that, until now, discussion of this aspect of Tolkien's sub-creation has been sparse in secondary literature. The 14 papers presented in this volume set out to address this important gap.<br/><br/>Besides musical references found in Tolkien's own works, the scope of Middle-earth music has over the years been further extended by various attempts to either set Tolkien's song texts to music, or to create derivative musical works. Such creations range from the songs and music of the various films and radio adaptions to such phenomena as Tolkien-inspired Black Metal. Besides the musical refences found in Tolkien's own writings, this volume also looks at these works.}}
