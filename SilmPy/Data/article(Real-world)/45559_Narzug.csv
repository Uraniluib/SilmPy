'''Narzug''' was a member of the [[Orcs|Orc]] pack that was pursuing [[Thorin and Company]] in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' film series]]. He was played by [[Ben Mitchell]].

==History==
When the pack had caught up with the Company during their escape from the [[Woodland Realm]], Narzug was ultimately taken prisoner by [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]], and they take him back to the [[Elvenking's Halls]]. When being interrogated by [[Thranduil]] about why the pack was pursuing the company of [[Dwarves]], Narzug claims his master is serving "[[Sauron|The One]]", which causes some alarm to the Elven-king, triggering him to cut off Narzug's head.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''</ref>
