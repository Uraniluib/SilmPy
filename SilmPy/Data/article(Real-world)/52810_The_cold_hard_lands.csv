"'''The cold hard lands'''" is a song composed by [[Gollum]] that he sings in "[[The Passage of the Marshes]]."

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The cold hard lands,
they bites our hands,
  they gnaws our feet.
The rocks and stones
are like old bones
  all bare of meat.
But stream and pool
is wet and cool:
  so nice for feet!
And now we wish â€”
</poem>

At this point Gollum interrupted himself to allude to the [[Riddles in the Dark|riddle-game]] he and [[Bilbo Baggins]] partook in many decades before:

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Alive without breath;
as cold as death;
never thirsting, ever drinking;
clad in mail, never clinking.
Drowns on dry land,
thinks an island
is a mountain;
thinks a fountain
is a puff of air.
So sleek, so fair!
  What a joy to meet!
We only wish
to catch a fish,
  so juicy-sweet!
</poem>
