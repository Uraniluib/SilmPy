'''''Alviska fraser''''' ("Elvish Phrases") is a Swedish-language linguistic booklet, published by Mellonath Daeron, the language guild of [[Forodrim]].

==Review from The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship==

Mellonath Daeron or the language guild of Forodrim, founded in 1972, in the beginning of this year published a very interesting and nice-looking booklet entitled Alviska fraser ('Elvish Phrases"). These 25 pages edited by Per Lindberg (Gildir) and designed by [[Måns Björkman]] (Elerosse) contain analysis of all the Tolkien's shorter texts in [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]]. And more! On page 23 we can see the Bruinen Spell composed by the language specialists of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]] movie! This interesting Sindarin phrase is analyzed by Per Lindberg.

We recommend this wonderful publication being another long step towards full uderstanding of the J.R.R. Tolkien's languages! In spite it is in Swedish it is understandable to every Tolkienian linguist.<ref>[http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/news_archive.htm News Archive May - October 2001], retrieved July 3, 2010</ref>
