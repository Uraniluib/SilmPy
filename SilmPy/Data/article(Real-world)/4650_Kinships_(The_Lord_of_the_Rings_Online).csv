'''Kinships''' are long-term alliances in created by player characters in [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]. A player can create a kinship at level 15, and the benefits of a kinship increase the longer it lasts, and they can exist with only a single player or hundreds. Kinships are formed in order to socialize, role play or group together to complete game objectives.
