==Excerpt==

{{Blockquote|Tolkien remarked that the reviewer should not have made such a fuss over giving quarters to [[orcs]]. 'Surely how often "quarter" is given is off the point in a book that breathes Mercy from start to finish: in which the central hero is at last divested of all arms, except his will? "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil", are words that occur to me, and of which the scene, in the [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]] was meant to be a "fairy-story" exemplum ...'|<ref name=TS/>}}
