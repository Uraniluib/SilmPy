Letter 122, dated [[18 December]] [[1949]], was sent to [[Naomi Mitchison]], and Tolkien announces the completion of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and refers to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and discusses Nordic and Celtic languages. 

The original letter has been sould through [[Sotheby's]] on several occasions, most recently on 11 December 2006. Sotheby's describes the letter in the following way: "Autograph letter signed ("J.R.R. Tolkien"), 2 pages on one leaf on stationery embossed "3 Manor Road, Holywell, Oxford" (7 x 5 in.; 178 x 127 mm, sight), 12 [SIC] December 1949, to Mrs. Naomi Mitchison ... Matted, framed and double-glazed with a photograph of Tolkien."

==Summary==

Tolkien announces the completion of ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the Scottish novelist and poet, Naomi Mitchison: ''"I hope to give you soon two books, about which at least one criticism will be possible: that they are excessively long! One is a sequel to The Hobbit which I have just finished after 12 years (intermittent) labour. I fear it is 3 times as long, not for children (though that does not mean wholly unsuitable), and rather grim in places. I think it is very much better (in a different way.) The other is pure myth and legend of times already remote in Bilbo's days . . . "'' A good friend of Tolkien, Mitchison was one of the proofreaders for ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Tolkien also criticizes his publisher's use of the maps as endpapers in ''The Hobbit'': ''" . . . it was a blunder of the publisher to make the maps into end-papers (which they were not meant to be) and put the specially designed end-papers in reduced form to face p. 147! or thereabouts."''

He mentions [[dragons]] but that he is not informed enough on the subject to have much of an opinion. ''"I find 'dragons' a fascinating product of imagination. But I don't think the [[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]] one is frightfully good. But the whole problem of the intrusion of the 'dragon' into northern imagination and its transformation there is one I do not know enough about."'' He then focuses on his linguistic studies of Norse and Celtic languages. ''"I know Icelandic pretty well ... and a little Welsh, but in spite of efforts I have always been rather heavily defeated by Old Irish or indeed its modern descendant. The mix-up was politically and culturally great and complexâ€”but it left very little linguistic trace on Icelandic."''
