== Cover/Jacket Text == 

Four low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

Bar-en-Tinnen is a sleepy little town on the banks of the mighty Anduin river. But now the complacent inhabitants must keep their eyes open. A ghost haunts the river on foggy nights; the wise bar their doors at sundown. Can you unlock the mystery of The Ghost on the River? 

The haunted riverfront is not the most terrifying of recent events. A young lad, panic stricken, dripping wet, and shivering, collapses on the doorstep of the Fen Worm's Fire Inn, a broken arrow shaft protruding from his left arm. Will you help defeat his enemies in The Survivor? 

The tailor's son disappears after encountering the river ghost and telling the story far and wide. Will you face the darkest evil to search for the young man in The Edain-in-Arthedur? 

Despite plentiful rainfall, the trees and crops are withering. A supernatural blight has struck the land. Are you resourceful enough to combat The Shadow on the Banks? 

Confront bandits, undead, evil priests, and minions of Sauron as you hunt the Ghosts of the Southern Anduin in these four exciting adventures!
