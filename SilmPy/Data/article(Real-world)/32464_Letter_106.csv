==Summary==
[[Allen and Unwin]] were enthusiastic about ''Farmer Giles of Ham'' but asked if more stories could be provided to fill up a volume.  Tolkien was delighted that they wanted to publish his story but right then, due to academic pressures, he did not have the time to give them extra stories.  Tolkien wanted to concentrate on ''[[The Hobbit]]'' sequel.  He had written a chapter for it the week before and then drowned in official business for ten days.  Tolkien also mentioned that he had no illustrations for ''Farmer Giles''.
