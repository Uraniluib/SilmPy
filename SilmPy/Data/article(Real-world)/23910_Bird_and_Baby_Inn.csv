==Inspiration==
The Bird and Baby Inn did not appear in the books of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. The inclusion of a tavern named "Bird and Baby" is a reference to the real-world tavern ''[[Eagle and Child]]'' in [[Oxford]], England which was frequented by the members of The Inklings.

Students of Oxford University who frequent the ''Eagle and Child'' often refer to the tavern as the ''Bird and Baby'' (among other colorful names).
