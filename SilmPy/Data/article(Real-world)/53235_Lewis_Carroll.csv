'''Lewis Carroll''' (pen name used by '''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''';  27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898) was an English author and holder of a Mathematical Lectureship at Christ Church College, [[University of Oxford]]. 

==Tolkien on Carroll==
===''The Hobbit'' jacket remarks''===
Carroll published two books now deemed as fantasy classics, ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1865) and ''Through the Looking-Glass'' (1871). Sharing tenure at Oxford and authorship of fantasy, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was hastily compared with Carroll by some early reviewers of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, p. 96</ref> The reviewers of ''The Hobbit'' comparing it to the ''Alice'' stories, appear to have "''relied overmuch on the publisher's blurb''",<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 398</ref> which stated that:

{{Blockquote|The birth of ''The Hobbit'' recalls very strongly that of ''Alice in Wonderland''. Here again a professor of an abstruse subject is at play.|<ref name=L15>{{L|15}}</ref>}}

Tolkien offered comments about the "abstruse subject" and the comparison with ''Alice in Wonderland'' in his [[Letter 15]]. Concerning the latter point, Tolkien wrote that ''The Hobbit'' "is more comparable to Dodgson's amateur photography, and his song of Hiawatha's failure<ref group=note>The "''song of Hiawatha's failure''" can be found within Carroll's ''[[Wikipedia:Rhyme? and Reason?|Rhyme? and Reason?]]'', entitled "Hiawatha's Photographing".</ref> than to ''Alice''". He did, however, concede  that "the compliment to ''The Hobbit'' is rather high" and, if the comparison is to be maintained, that Carroll's ''Through the Looking-Glass'' "ought to be mentioned" as it "is much closer in every way".<ref name=L15/>

===On Fairy-Stories===
At the beginning of his essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', Tolkien separates the "genuine fairy-story" from other forms of fantastical tales. Literary genres sometimes (but erroneously or carelessly, according to Tolkien) defined as fairy-stories include travellers' tales (e.g., [[Wikipedia:Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:A Voyage to Lilliput|A Voyage to Lilliput]]''), [[Wikipedia:Beast fable|beast-fables]], and dream-stories. Pertaining to the latter, Tolkien names Carroll's ''Alice'' stories, which he describes as "successful and amusing". However, the ''Alice'' stories are only an illusion found within the frame of a dream, and do thus not touch on the notion of [[Faerie#Inspiration|Faërie]] — the primary and defining characteristic of the fairy-story.<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, pp. 32-37</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 684</ref>
===Other mentions and curiosa===

Working for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Tolkien suggested "''for future addition ... at least a quotation from'' [[Wikipedia:Sylvie and Bruno|Sylvie and Bruno]] ''by Lewis Carroll, illustrating the word'' smirkle".<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 727</ref> 

[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have noted that Tolkien:

{{Blockquote|...was amused by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1865) and ''Through the Looking Glass'' (1872); later in his life he was also fond of Carroll's ''Sylvie and Bruno'' (1889) and ''Sylvie and Bruno Concluded'' (1893), and occasionally recited verses from them.|<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 815</ref>}}

Tolkien's friend [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] was founder of the Lewis Carroll Society, and edited and wrote an introduction for ''The Works of Lewis Carroll'' (1965).

[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that Tolkien's creation of the word [[The Book of Ishness|''ishness'']] might have been inspired by a passage in chapter 7 of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'': "did you ever see a thing as a drawing of a muchness!".<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 65 (note 13)</ref>
