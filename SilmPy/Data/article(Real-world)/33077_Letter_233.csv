==Summary==
Tolkien had made a search for poems to accompany "[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]" for a small book.  He had not found much that really went with the Tom Bombadil poem.  He was sending [[Allen and Unwin]] the poems "[[Errantry]]" and "The Man in the Moon",<ref group="note">Whether this was "[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]" or "[[The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon]]" was not specified.</ref> but he was doubtful about the rest.  However, if they thought them publishable and could get [[Pauline Baynes]] to illustrate them he would be delighted.
