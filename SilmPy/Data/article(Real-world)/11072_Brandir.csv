{{Pronounce|Brandir.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Brandir the Lame''' ({{FA|465}}–{{FA|499|n}}, aged 34 years) was a [[Men|Man]] of the [[House of Haleth]].  He was the son of [[Handir]] and [[Beldis]] and was named after his mother’s brother.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (iii) The Haladin'', p. 237</ref>  Brandir became a leader of his people despite his deformity, yet he became ensnared by the doom of [[Túrin]] and died by his sword unjustly.

==History==
Brandir suffered some accident in his childhood that resulted in a broken leg and left him lame thereafter.  Due to his mishap and because of his gentle mood he was never a man of war, taking delight instead in all things that grew in the earth.<ref name="Brethil">{{CH|13}}</ref>  Yet after his father died Brandir inherited the chieftainship of the [[Men of Brethil]] and thus was their lord when Túrin arrived in {{FA|496}}.<ref>{{GA|291}}</ref>

Túrin was brought into [[Ephel Brandir]] upon a bier carried by the woodmen that he had saved from an [[Orcs|Orc]] attack.  He had swooned upon seeing the mound where the woodmen had buried the dead [[Finduilas]] and when Brandir looked upon Túrin a shadow darkened his heart.  However Brandir tended to Túrin in his house until he cast off his darkness.  Although Túrin determined to renounce his past and took on the new name of [[Túrin|Turambar]], he still hunted Orcs with other woodmen, which displeased Brandir as he believed the best policy to preserve his people was through silence and secrecy. <ref name="Brethil"/>

Brandir's healing skills were needed again when Túrin brought in a feverish young woman that he and a party of woodmen had found while out seeking Orcs.  Since she had been unable to speak and had been weeping they called her [[Níniel]].  Although Brandir healed her and fell in love with her, her heart was given to Turambar.  In {{FA|497|n}} Túrin asked Níniel to marry him but Brandir counseled her to wait because of the fear in his heart regarding Túrin.  Seeking to dissuade her, Brandir revealed Túrin's lineage to her.  Níniel did put off the marriage due to the words of Brandir (which did not please Túrin), but did marry Túrin at mid-summer of the following year.<ref>{{CH|15}}</ref>

By the third year of Túrin's abiding at Ephel Brandir he had become the ''de facto'' leader of the Men of Brethil and Brandir went unheeded.  Gone was the policy of hiding; instead Túrin led the woodmen in many battles against the Orcs.  Yet these deeds drew the dread dragon [[Glaurung]] from ruined [[Nargothrond]], who crawled in a straight path towards Brethil.  When Túrin asked for volunteers to go with him to meet the dragon [[Dorlas]] came forth.  Seeing the others hold back, Dorlas chided them and asked if none would take the place of Brandir so that the [[House of Haleth]] would not be put to shame.  Thus Brandir, long unheeded, was subjected to scorn and became bitter at heart.

After Túrin, Dorlas, and Hunthor had gone, Níniel decided that she had to follow her husband.  Ignoring Brandir's plea that she wait, Níniel led a great company of the woodmen to [[Nen Girith]] to seek tidings of the three hunters' fate.  Unable to endure the scorn and disdain that had been heaped upon him, Brandir renounced his lordship and people.  Yet still he loved Níniel and so, taking up his crutch and a short sword, he hobbled after the throng.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>

Brandir caught up with Níniel at Nen Girith where she had been stricken upon hearing the far-off voice of Glaurung.  Brandir attempted to lead her away to safety but she sped away to seek Túrin.  Again Brandir was forced to limp after her as best he could.  Again he caught up with her but too late, for by then Glaurung had revealed to Níniel that she was in truth [[Niënor]], sister of Túrin, and that she carried her brother's child in her belly.  Brandir heard Glaurung's words and was so stricken that he leaned against a tree.  For a third time Níniel ran with Brandir calling after her but this time he could not catch up, for Niënor cast herself into the waters of [[Cabed-en-Aras]].  Brandir was the last man to peer into its darkness and he turned away in horror.

Limping back to [[Nen Girith]], Brandir encountered Dorlas, who had quailed at crossing the [[Teiglin]].  Realizing that Dorlas' cowardice had contributed to Níniel's death, Brandir proclaimed his hatred for Dorlas.  Dorlas tried to strike Brandir but died when Brandir hewed him with his sword.  Brandir then hobbled on to bring the tidings to the people of Brethil still gathered at Nen Girith.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>

Brandir had thought Túrin dead, and thus was amazed when he appeared before the gathering.  Brandir then told Túrin that his wife was dead and revealed that she had been his sister.  In wrath Túrin called Brandir "[[Club-foot]]" and slandered him, and then drew the black sword [[Gurthang]] and slew him.  Soon though Túrin met [[Mablung]] the Hunter who confirmed Brandir's words.  Túrin ran and asked his sword if it would slay him swiftly.  Gurthang replied that it would, to forget the blood of [[Beleg]], killed by accident, and Brandir, killed unjustly.<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>
