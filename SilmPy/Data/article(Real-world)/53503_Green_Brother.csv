The '''Green Brother''' is a mysterious character in the ''[[Letters from Father Christmas|Father Christmas Letters]]''. He is the son of [[Grandfather Yule]] and the brother of [[Father Christmas]].<ref>{{LFC|1930b}}</ref>

Like Father Christmas, the Green Brother collects food, clothes, and toys for poor children.<ref>{{LFC|1931b}}</ref> Father's Christmas's green trousers were a present from his green brother.<ref>{{LFC|1932b}}</ref>

==Inspiration==

While Deborah and Ivor Rogers argued in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Critical Biography]]'' (1982) that the Green Brother represented "the embodiment of ancient springtime fertility myths" (suggestive of the [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (disambiguation)|Green Knight]]), Kris Swank has suggested that the Green Brother:

{{blockquote|might have been Tolkien’s explanation to his children why Victorian pictures of Father Christmas showed him wearing green robes. Grandfather Yule, whose name is also Nicholas ‚after the Saint‛ (FCL 39), might, then, refer to the pre-Victorian image of the mid-winter spirit|Kris Swank<ref>Kris Swank, "[http://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-350791919/the-hobbit-and-the-father-christmas-letters ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Father Christmas Letters'']", in [[Mythlore 123|''Mythlore'' 123]]</ref>}}

The Green Brother would thus in the latter's interpretation rather be a Christmas figure than a summer figure.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Janet Brennan Croft]], [[David Bratman]]|articleurl=http://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/mythsoc/conversations/topics/26462|articlename=Father Christmas Letters|dated=24 December 2016|website=Mythsoc|accessed=2 January 2017}}</ref>
