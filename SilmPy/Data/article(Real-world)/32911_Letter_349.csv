==Summary==
Tolkien told Mrs. Ehrardt he did not understand her wish to associate his name with TOLK, an interpreter or spokesman.  A word of Slavonic origin, adopted in Lithuanian (TULKAS), Finnish (TULKKI), and in Scandinavian languages, across Northern Germany, and finally into Dutch (TOLK).  However, it had never been adopted into English.
