==Summary==
Tolkien feared that he had been far too casual about "magic" and the use of the word, although criticism by [[Galadriel]] and others of the "mortal" use of the term showed that thought about it was not casual.  It was a very large and difficult question and the story of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' could hardly be burdened with a pseudo-philosophic disquisition!  Tolkien had no intent to debate whether "magic" was real or possible in the world.

For the purposes of the tale there was a latent distinction between what was once called ''magia'' and ''goeteia''.<ref group="note">The second term, in English ''Goety'', is defined in the [[Wikipedia:Oxford English Dictionary|O.E.D.]] as "witchcraft or magic performed by the invocation and employment of evil spirits; necromancy".</ref>  Galadriel spoke of the "deceits of the Enemy".<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref>  ''Magia'' was held to be good and ''goeteia'' bad; in this tale neither is good or bad except by motive or purpose or use.  Both sides used both, but with different motives.  The supremely bad motive was the domination of other "free" wills.  The Enemy's operations were not all goetic deceits, but "magic" that produced real effects in the physical world.  However, his ''magia'' bulldozed people and things, and his ''goeteia'' terrified and subjugated.  Elves and [[Gandalf]] sparingly used ''magia'' for real results (such as fire in a wet faggot) for specific beneficent purposes.  They used ''goeteia'' entirely for artistic effects because to Elves the result was as obvious to them as the difference between fiction, painting, sculpture and life is to us (although Elvish ''goeteia'' might deceive or bewilder unaware Men).

Both sides lived mainly by "ordinary" means.  The Enemy and those like him went in for "machinery".  The basic motive of ''magia'' is immediacy: speed, reduction of labour, and reduction of the gap between the idea or desire and the result or effect.  But since ''magia'' was not easy to come by and since the Enemy had abundant slave-labour or machinery, the latter means was often preferred.  Another factor then enters, a moral or pathological one: tyrants lose sight of objects, become cruel, and enjoy smashing, hurting, and defiling.  One could defend poor [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]]'s new and more efficient mills, but not [[Sharkey]] and [[Ted Sandyman|Sandyman]]'s use of them.

A difference in Tolkien’s "magic" is that it cannot be attained by "lore" or spells; it is an inherent power not possessed by Men as such.  [[Aragorn]]'s healing might have been regarded as "magical", or a blend of magic with pharmacy and hypnotism, but it was reported by hobbits with little notions of philosophy or science.  Aragorn was not a pure "Man" but at long remove was one of the "children of [[Lúthien]]".

Alongside the final paragraph of this part of the letter that was not sent Tolkien had written: "But the Númenóreans used 'spells' in making swords?"
