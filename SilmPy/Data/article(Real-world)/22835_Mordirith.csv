'''''Mordirith''''' is a character created specifically for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''. He is the main antagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar|Shadows of Angmar]]'', the first release and first Epic Volume of the game. He was the [[Wraiths|Wraith]] steward of [[Carn Dûm]].

The [[Witch-king]]'s Steward, Mordirith, was once his greatest foe: [[Eärnur]], [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]. Eärnur was twice challenged by the Witch-king, and the second time he could not refuse. He rode into [[Minas Morgul]] and was never seen alive again.<ref name="AA">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Mordirith later appeared in [[Angmar]] to rule in the Witch-king's stead, but few knew his true identity. Under Mordirith's rule, [[Orcs]] and evil [[Men]] multiplied in the remnants of the realm so that by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Angmar posed a threat to the diminished peoples of [[Eriador]].

After Mordirith was defeated in Angmar, his spirit returned to Minas Morgul, where he received another body from his master. He led the Morgul-host in the conquest of [[Osgiliath]] and the siege of [[Minas Tirith]] under a new name - Gothmog, the Dread Terror of Minas Morgul. After the defeat of Sauron's forces at the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]], it appears that Gothmog shut himself in Minas Morgul, cut off from both Mordor and Ithilien, as the forces of the West destroyed the bridge leading to the [[Morgul Vale]] from the west and the spawn of Shelob took control of the [[Ephel Duath]] near Minas Morgul.
