==Back cover==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s magical world of [[Middle-earth]] - a land inhabited by [[pipe-weed|tobacco]]-smoking, ale-brewing, [[Hobbits|Halfling]] superheroes, eon-old [[Elves|Elven]] kings, chanting time-travellers, messianic [[Istari|wizards]] and satanic [[Sauron|war-lords]] - remains unparalleled in its scope and vision and unsurpassed in its appeal and fascination for countless millions of people of all ages the world over.

Now, in this long-awaited study, Professor Helms shows how the master story-teller succeeded in combining a scholarly knowledge of traditional mythological literature with an imaginative genius to create fantasy epics of universal significance.
