'''''The War of the Jewels''''' is the eleventh volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and the second of two volumes on the later development of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

It is the second volume—''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' being the first—to explore the later 1951 ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' drafts (those written after the completion of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.)

This volume includes:
* The second part of the 1951 ''Silmarillion'' drafts
* An expanded account of "[[The Grey Annals]]" — the history of [[Beleriand]] after the coming of the [[Elves]].
* Additional narratives involving [[Húrin]] and the tragedy of his children (see [[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]). "The Wanderings of Húrin" is the conclusion to the "''Narn''". This was not included in the final ''Silmarillion'' because Christopher Tolkien feared that the heavy compression which would have been necessary to make it a stylistic match with the rest of the book would have been too difficult and would have made the story overly complex and difficult to read.
* Christopher Tolkien's explanation of how he, with the collaboration of fantasy author  [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], constructed Chapter 22 of ''The Silmarillion'', since none of the texts left by Tolkien for this purpose were up-to-date enough to serve the purpose.  In particular, the old texts all have [[Thingol]] portrayed as a miserly swindler who cheats the [[Dwarves]] out of their payment, and the portrayal of the [[Girdle of Melian]] in the older stories is much weaker than the impenetrable barrier of the post-''Lord of the Rings'' writings.
* "[[Quendi and Eldar]]" which discusses in greater detail the [[Awakening of the Elves|origin of the Elves]] and their [[Sundering of the Elves|sunderings]].
* Tolkien's exploration of the origins of the [[Ents]] and the great [[Eagles]]

==From the Publisher==

{{blockquote|The second of two companion volumes which documents the later writing of The Silmarillion, Tolkien’s epic tale of war.In The War of the Jewels Christopher Tolkien takes up his account of the later history of The Silmarillion from the point where it was left in Morgoth’s Ring. The story now returns to Middle-earth, and the ruinous conflict of the High Elves and the Men who were their allies with the power fothe Dark Lord. With the publication in this book of all J.R.R. Tolkien’s later narrative writing concerned with the last centuries of the First Age, the long history of The Silmarillion, from its beginning in The Book of Lost Tales, is completed; and the enigmatic state of the work at his death can be understood.This book contains the full text of the Grey Annals, the primary record of The War of the Jewels, and a major story of Middle-earth now published for the first time: the tale of the disaster that overtook the forest people of Brethil when Hurin the Steadfast came among them after his release from long years of captivity in Angband, the fortress of Morgoth.}}
