'''Rhymes of Lore''' are small poems that refer to ancient events of history. Rhymes of Lore seem to originate from the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Arnor]], some were known to the [[Hobbits]] who also had some Rhymes of their own.<ref>{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> The [[Long List of the Ents]] may also be an example of Rhymes of Lore.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}} p. 329</ref>

On his way to [[Minas Tirith]] [[Gandalf]] mumbled to himself a Rhyme about the [[Downfall of Númenor]], causing [[Pippin]] to inquire about it.
:''Tall ships and [[High Men|tall kings]]<br>Three times three,<br>What brought they from the [[Númenor|foundered land]] <br>Over the [[Belegaer|flowing sea]]? <br>Seven stars and [[palantíri|seven stones]] <br>And one [[White Tree|white tree]].''<ref group=note>The rhyme is titled "A Rhyme of Lore"</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[Robert Foster]] describes the Rhymes of Lore as a medium that aids the retention of ancient facts.<ref name=guide/> They are comparable to [[Wikipedia:Gnomic poetry#Medieval_and_early_modern_gnomic_literature|Gnomic Verses]] that preserve important ideas of the Anglo-Saxon society. Their rhyme make them easy to remember.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anglo-Saxon-Part-1.pdf|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 1|dated=2014|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>
==Adaptations==
A musical version of this poem was recorded by the [[Tolkien Ensemble]] on their album ''A Night in Rivendell''.
