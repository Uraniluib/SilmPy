<poem style="font-style:italic;margin-left:20px;">
I sit beside the fire and think
of all that I have seen
of meadow-flowers and butterflies
in summers that have been;
 
Of yellow leaves and gossamer
in autumns that there were,
with morning mist and silver sun
and wind upon my hair.
 
I sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that I shall ever see.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=yl4dILkcqm4C&pg=PT197&dq=i+sit+beside+the+fire+and+think&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0vEJVKbcLIWOyATv-4DwBw&ved=0CCsQuwUwAg#v=onepage&q=i%20sit%20beside%20the%20fire%20and%20think&f=false</ref>
 
For still there are so many things
that I have never seen:
in every wood in every spring
there is a different green.
 
I sit beside the fire and think
of people long ago
and people who will see a world
that I shall never know.
 
But all the while I sit and think
of times there were before,
I listen for returning feet
and voices at the door.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>
