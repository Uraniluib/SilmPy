'''''Bilbo's Last Song''''' is a poem written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It is sung by [[Bilbo Baggins]] at the [[Grey Havens]] as he is about to leave [[Middle-earth]]. Chronologically this places it at the very end of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', the last volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', although it was written later than the books and never included in them.

==History==
It was originally a text without link with Bilbo's story, entitled ''Vestr um haf'', but Tolkien changed it in October 1968. It was given by Tolkien as a gift to his secretary [[Joy Hill]] in 1968 after she discovered it in Tolkien's library. 

After Tolkien's death in [[1973]], Hill showed the poem to [[Donald Swann]], who liked the poem so much that he set it to music and included it in the second edition of ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'' in [[1978]].<ref>{{RGEO|Bilbo}}</ref> The poem was also illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], and published as a poster on [[26 November]] [[1974]]. 

The song was included in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1981), with music by Stephen Oliver. The first verse is chanted by John Le Mesurier as Bilbo, the second omitted, and the third sung by a boy soprano.
 
In [[1990]] the text was finally published in book form by Unwin Hyman, re-illustrated by Baynes.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=61220|articlename=Bilbo's Last Song. 1990|dated=|website=TB|accessed=29 October 2012}}</ref> New editions appeared in [[2002]] (Hutchinson, hardcover),<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=61240|articlename=Bilbo's Last Song. 2002|dated=|website=TB|accessed=29 October 2012}}</ref> and [[2012]] (Red Fox/Random House, paperback).<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/bilbos-last-song/9780099439752|articlename=Bilbo's Last Song|dated=|website=[http://www.randomhouse.co.uk RandomHouse.co.uk]|accessed=29 October 2012}}</ref>

In 1996 the song was recorded by the [[Unquendor|Dutch Tolkien Society]] band [[The Hobbitons]], with permission from the [[Tolkien Estate]], for their CD ''J.R.R. Tolkien's Songs from Middle-earth''.<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://web.archive.org/web/20021210152658/http://home.wxs.nl/~hobbiton/home.html The Hobbitons] (via [http://www.archive.org Internet Archive]) |articlename=Our CD|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021207123849/home.wxs.nl/~hobbiton/OURCD.HTM|accessed=27 May 2014}}</ref>

The copyright of the poem was given by Tolkien to Hill together with the poem itself. Upon her death in 1991, Hill gave the copyright to the [[Wikipedia:Order of the Holy Paraclete|Order of the Holy Paraclete]]. Baynes's illustrations for ''Bilbo's Last Song'' were not included in the bequeathing to the Order, but were given the [[Wikipedia:Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford|Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford]] upon her death in 2008.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.
