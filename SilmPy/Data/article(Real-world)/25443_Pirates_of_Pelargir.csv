== Cover/Jacket Text == 

Three low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

At an Inn called the Tipsy Triton you listen intently as a sea captain tells of pirate raids off the Red Cliff Coast. He needs strong-hearted mates to sign on for the voyage. Dare you sail with the master of The Lady Gilwen? 

Pirate raids have pushed the local merchants to their limit. A reward is offered for the discovery of the Laughing Raider's hiding place. Will you take up the Search for the Raider's Harbor? 

The fair Dorien is being held captive by blood-thirsty pirates. She will soon be sold into slavery. Who will stage a raid into the pirate's stronghold to rescue her? 

The risks are great, but so are the rewards in these 3 exciting adventures!
