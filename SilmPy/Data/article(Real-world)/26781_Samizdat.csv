'''Samizdat''' (Russian: '''самиздат''') is a term from Russian, describing a self-published book. It found its origin during the Soviet era, where dissident works were published and distributed privately.

[[Mark T. Hooker]] first used the term to describe the many unauthorized or "pirate" translations of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s work in Russian, but over time the term has been adopted for translations in all languages.
