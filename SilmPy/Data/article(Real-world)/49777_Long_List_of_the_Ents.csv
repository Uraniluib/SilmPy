The '''Long List of the Ents'''<ref>{{RK|I1a}}</ref> was a song of lore known to the [[Ents]] that listed every living creature known to them.

On [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] met [[Treebeard]] in [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref>  Puzzled to meet creatures he had never seen before, Treebeard began reciting the list to see if he could recall where the two [[Hobbits]] might fit in, but decided that they were indeed missing.  Pippin suggested adding a new line, ''Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers'', next to [[Men]], which Treebeard thought was a good idea.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

After the parley with [[Saruman]] on [[5 March]],<ref name=Great/> Treebeard greeted the victors and revealed that he had added Hobbits to the Long List: 
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Ents the earthborn, old as mountains,
the wide-walkers, water drinking;
and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children,
the laughing-folk, the little people,<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref>
</poem>
