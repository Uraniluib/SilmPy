<center>{{quote|Míriel was the name of his mother, who was called Serindë, because of her surpassing skill in weaving and needlework; for her hands were more skilled to fineness than any hands even among the Noldor.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor ]]}}</center>

'''Míriel Þerindë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈmiːri.el θeˈrinde]}}), also spelled '''Serindë''' (pron. {{IPA|seˈrinde]}}), was the first wife of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]]. Her son was ''[[Curufinwë]]'', whom she called [[Fëanor|Fëanáro]], which means "Spirit of Fire". Miriel's hair was described as being silver in appearance, an unusual colour for one of the [[Noldor]].

==History==
Míriel lived in the blessed realm of [[Aman]], in the hill city of [[Tirion]] on [[Túna]], together with her husband [[Finwë]] High King of the [[Noldor]]. Her hands were skilled in the shaping of fine things, and she was unsurpassed in weaving and needlework.

There was much love between Míriel and Finwë, and even more for her son, but after giving birth to [[Fëanor]] in {{YT|1169}}<ref name="Fourth">{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 205</ref>, her body and her spirit were consumed and she wished to be released from life everlasting, saying that there was no strength left in her to bear another child. Despite Finwë's grief, and her unhappiness at abandoning her young child, Míriel departed for the gardens of [[Irmo|Lórien]], to rest and regain her strength and vigour. But during her rest, the [[Fëa and hröa|fëa]] departed from her body, and entered the [[Halls of Mandos]] leaving her body laying lifeless and still in {{YT|1170}}<ref name="Fourth"/>. Maidens of [[Estë]] took care of her body while her spirit remained in the Halls of Mandos, so that it would not wither. In essence, she had died of free will. This was seen as a shocking event by the [[Valar]] and [[Eldar]] which had never before occurred. [[Manwë]] allowed Finwë to take another wife given these exceptional circumstances.<ref name="Feanor">{{S|Feanor}}</ref>

After the death of Finwë, Míriel was granted permission to return to life, where she entered the service of [[Vairë]], her task to record all the deeds of the [[House of Finwë]].<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, p. 207</ref>

==Etymology==
The name '''Míriel''' means "Jewel-daughter" in [[Quenya]], from ''[[mír]]'' ("jewel") and ''[[-iel]]'' ("daughter"). Her ''[[epessë]]'' '''[[Þerindë]]''', or '''Serindë''' in the [[Quenya]] of [[Tirion]], means "the Broideress", referring to her great skill in embroidery for 'her chief talent was a marvelous dexterity of hand'<ref>The Peoples of Middle Earth; The Shibboleth of Feanor, Page 333</ref> which she applied to her skill of embroidery, 'achieving in what even the Eldar thought haste' embroidery that 'was finer and more intricate than any that had before been seen'<ref>The Peoples of Middle Earth; The Shibboleth of Feanor, Page 333</ref>. It was her Mother Name<ref>The Peoples of Middle Earth; The Shibboleth of Feanor, Page 333</ref>. It is to be noted that she preferred and requested her kin use the older pronunciation of Þerindë, and that her son upheld the use of Þ over s out of respect and in her memory<ref>The Peoples of Middle Earth; The Shibboleth of Feanor, Page 336</ref>.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the beginning of ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', Fëanor is an adult, and Míriel is still alive. There the similarities between mother and son, such as their stubbornness, are revealed. Fëanor's reaction to his mother's death is also presented, as he guarded her [[Fëa and hröa|hröa]], which was placed in a garden, for some time after her passing.<ref>{{PM|Case}}</ref> In the  published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', Míriel died soon after his birth.<ref name="Feanor"/>
