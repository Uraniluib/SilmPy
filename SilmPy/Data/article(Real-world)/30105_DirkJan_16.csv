'''''DirkJan 16''''' is a Dutch comic book featuring several strips dedicated to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It is the 16th book of [[wikipedia:Mark Retera|Mark Retera]]'s ''[[wikipedia:DirkJan|DirkJan]]'' comic book series, and was first published in [[2010#October|October]] [[2010]].

Retera often sets his strip in either historical or fictional settings, and chose [[Middle-earth]] for 5 three-panel strips (pages 30-31). In it, the characters take such long time to prepare that there is no room left for the actual quest, which is summarized only in the last panel as "they succeeded".
