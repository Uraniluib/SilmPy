{{quote|'''Glorfindel''' was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.|[[The Fellowship of the Ring]], ''[[Many Meetings]]''}}
'''Glorfindel''' ([[Sindarin|S]] "golden haired", pron. {{IPA|[ɡlorˈfindel]}})<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}, page 17.</ref> was one of the mightiest [[Elves]] of [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Third Age]]. He was distinctive because of his return to [[Middle-earth]] after death, acting as an emissary of the [[Valar]], on a similar mission to the [[Istari]] who were to come several thousand years later.

==History==
===Early History===

Glorfindel was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]]. He was of the host of [[Turgon]]. Glorfindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]].

===Gondolin===

After the [[Exile of the Noldor]] Glorfindel’s history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim|Twelve Houses]] of [[Gondolin]]. He was dearly loved by all the [[Gondolindrim]], and went about in a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, diapered with celandine "as a field in spring". His vambraces were [[Uncommon words#damask|damascened]] with "cunning gold".

[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'']]
He followed [[Turgon]] who surprisingly came to fight in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. When the war turned against the [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]], Turgon's and [[Fingon]]'s forces retreated to the [[Pass of Sirion]] and Glorfindel with [[Ecthelion]] guarded their flanks.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>


He witnessed the coming of [[Tuor]] and later the [[Fall of Gondolin]]. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Glorfindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the [[Great Market]] from the advancing [[orcs]]. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing [[Dragons|dragon]] came and levelled their ranks. Glorfindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the [[House of the Harp]] arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader [[Salgant]], ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the [[Square of the King]], one of the last of the Houses to be driven in.

As many of the lords had fallen, [[Ecthelion]] was wounded, [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] was engaged, and [[Egalmoth]] had not yet arrived, Glorfindel joined Tuor in leading the defense of the King’s Square. When Egalmoth arrived, bringing with him many women and children, he took over Glorfindel’s job in going from place to place, strengthening the defences. Glorfindel presumably threw himself once more into the thick of the fight. But even he could not prevent a dragon from coming down from the [[Alley of Roses]], breaking through their lines. The dragon was accompanied by orcs and balrogs, among them [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]]. Even Tuor was thrown down, but Ecthelion sacrificed himself to kill Gothmog and buy the Gondolindrim a little more time. When the Gondolindrim fled southward, and King Turgon was slain, Glorfindel held the rear manfully, losing many more of his House in the process. After they had escaped Gondolin via [[Idril's secret way]], and passed through the [[Cirith Thoronath]], Glorfindel again held the rear with the largest number of the unwounded.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel and the Balrog Above Gondolin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Glorfindel and the Balrog Above Gondolin'']]It was at that time that a balrog and a contingent of orcs ambushed their company. Glorfindel there accomplished his greatest deed, for he saved the lives of Tuor, [[Idril]], and all the company when he defied the balrog. They fought long. According to ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' Glorfindel stabbed it in the belly, but as the balrog fell it reached out and grabbed his long golden hair, pulling him back down over the edge of the cliff. He perished in the fall, but his body was borne up by [[Thorondor]], and buried him with a mound of stones in the pass. On that mound grew yellow flowers (possibly celandine), despite its remote location.

===Re-embodiment and Return===

Glorfindel’s spirit passed to the [[Halls of Mandos]], where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against [[Morgoth]]. But because of Glorfindel’s noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Tuor and Idril, he was re-embodied after only a short time. He had redeemed himself, and was purged of any guilt. Not only did his sacrifice get him an early pardon, it earned him great powers, so that he was almost an equal to the [[Maiar]].<ref name="PoME-LW">{{PM|Last}}, "Glorfindel I & II"</ref>

Eventually, [[Manwë]] sent him across the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Middle-earth]], possibly as early as [[Second Age 1200]], but more likely in [[Second Age 1600|1600]] with the [[Blue Wizards]]. If the latter date, he arrived just after [[the One Ring]] had been forged, [[Barad-dûr]] built, and [[Celebrimbor]] dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Glorfindel’s mission was to aid [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] in the struggle against [[Sauron]]. He played a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the war in [[Eriador]] and the other struggles of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]]. His part, though great, was mostly overlooked by the histories, because his immense, angelic power was not usually displayed openly.<ref name="PoME-LW" />

===Third Age===

[[File:Anna Lee - Glorfindel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anna Lee]] - ''Glorfindel'']] Glorfindel spent several hundred years in Valinor and for an unknown reason, near {{TA|1000}}, he landed with [[Gandalf|Olórin]]<ref name="PoME-LW">{{PM|Last}}, "Glorfindel I & II", pp. 377</ref>, who was on a similar mission of his own. Over time, as the few remaining great Elves of Middle-earth took ship to Aman or fell one by one, only [[Galadriel]], [[Celeborn]], [[Elrond]], and [[Círdan]] were left of the Wise. Glorfindel took a more active role, leading the Elven forces in the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Upon the humiliation of [[Eärnur]] before the [[Witch-king]], Glorfindel bade him not pursue, and prophesied that the wraith would not fall by the hand of man. Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the [[Westlands]] before the [[War of the Ring]]. 

During the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from [[Rivendell]] by Elrond to search for the [[Ring-bearer]]. Elrond had chosen him partially because Glorfindel did not fear the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], as he had great presence in both the [[Seen]] and [[Unseen]] worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Glorfindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], and his friend [[Aragorn]] with him. Glorfindel put Frodo on his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Frodo to safety across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Glorfindel, expecting the flood that protected Rivendell to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.

After this adventure, he helped bear Frodo to Rivendell, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Glorfindel attended the [[Council of Elrond]], playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of [[Tom Bombadil]] and other matters with authority. Glorfindel stood beside Elrond and Gandalf as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Glorfindel suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Gandalf noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], but as his friend Gandalf said, Glorfindel's power would be of little use against the might of [[Mordor]], on a mission of secrecy.

[[File:Ulla Thynell - Glorfindel.jpg|300px|thumb|Ulla Thynell - ''Glorfindel'']]
During the [[War of the Ring]] nothing is said of Glorfindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Elrond's company to the [[Wedding of Elessar]]. After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the [[Elves]] was over. He probably passed West, perhaps with the bearers of the [[Three Rings]] and [[the One Ring]]. Or he may have remained for a time in Middle-earth to oversee the cleanup after the war.

==Attributes==

Glorfindel was an elf of great beauty, power, wisdom, and moral courage. He was clearly loved by the people of [[Gondolin]], who mourned his passing greatly. He acted most courageously during the Fall, his House being among those that suffered the greatest losses, and eventually giving his own life for the safety of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], accomplishing the designs of the Valar, though it was said that he "''would have defended them even had they been fugitives of any rank''". He was repentant of the rebellion of the Noldor, and took no part in the Kinslaying. His acts in the Third Age also show great presence and authority, as does the very fact that he was sent as an emissary of the Valar.

==Etymology==

''Glorfindel'' means ([[Sindarin|S]] "golden haired", pron. [ɡlorˈfindel]). It is the [[Sindarin]] calque of '''[[Laurefindil]]'''<ref name="PE17"/> ([[Quenya|Q]]: "golden head of hair", pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌlaʊreˈfindil]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌlaʊreˈɸindil]}}), which is made up of two components; ''[[laure]]'' means "golden color" and ''findil'' or ''findilë'' means "head of hair". 

==Controversy==

Some have questioned whether Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell were the same. While writing the ''Lord of the Rings'' Tolkien simply borrowed a name from his earlier [[legendarium]], something he was known to do. ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', published posthumously, cast some light on this issue. Among the ''[[Last Writings]]'' published in that volume, there are two long essays, ''Glorfindel I'' and ''Glorfindel II''. These were written later in life by Tolkien, and directly addressed whether the two Glorfindels were the same person. Both essays clearly indicated that they were the same person, and included a detailed discussion of 're-embodiment' in Tolkien's mythology.

{{quote|. . . At any rate what at first sight may seem the simplest solution must be abandoned: sc. that we have merely a reduplication of names, and that Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell were different persons. This repetition of so striking a name, though possible, would not be credible… Also it may be found that acceptance of the identity of Glorfindel of old and of the Third Age will actually explain what is said of him and improve the story. . .|''[[Last Writings]]'', Glorfindel II}}

{{quote|. . . After his purging of any guilt that he had incurred in the rebellion, he was released from Mandos, and Manwë restored him… We may then best suppose that Glorfindel returned during the Second Age, before the ‘shadow’ fell on [[Númenor]]. . .|Ibid.}}

As Tolkien's legendarium was an evolving work that he constantly updated and revised, there will always be some question of "final intent". Some may note that the above-quoted essays were private and not ever published, and thus should not be taken as decisive. Nevertheless the editors of the Tolkien Gateway believe that these essays, combined with Tolkien's published novels, clearly establish that Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell were the same person.

==Parentage==
The narrative doesn't mention Glorfindel's ancestry or parentage, and it is not known whether Tolkien wrote about the subject. Considering his apparent nobility, and his name ''Glorfindel'' ("Golden-haired")<ref name="PE17"/><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> he could be a heritage of a possible Vanyarin intermarriage, as is the case of [[Finarfin]], [[Finrod]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Idril]]. [[Robert Foster]] suggests that he might belong to the [[House of Finarfin]]<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "House of Finarfin"</ref> (although Turgon was of the [[House of Fingolfin]]).

[[Finwë]]’s daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]], are two characters of the royal Noldorin-Vanyarin family tree about whom almost nothing is known, as well as whether they had descendants, leaving thus space for speculation about the ancestry of characters such as Glorfindel.

==Earlier Versions of the Legendarium==
In a hasty note about the Council of Elrond Tolkien suggested that Glorfindel could tell of his ancestry in Gondolin, but this idea was disbanded. 

Glorfindel was originally planned to be part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], in a way taking the place of [[Legolas]]. Tolkien proposed three dates as to his return to Middle-earth: {{TA|1000}}, with [[Gandalf]], {{SA|1200}} and the years following, or {{SA|1600}}. He dropped the first one after some thought, and though he declared the second possible, he favoured the last as the most probable.

Glorfindel is rarely portrayed like in the book. His role in ''The Lord of the Rings'' is too small to be introduced and forgotten - he basically does little else beyond providing fast transport to Rivendell. In the more popular works, his role has been filled by another Elf.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:In this adaptation, the role of Glorfindel was taken by [[Legolas]]. In a simplification of that character, and as a reason for ''his'' coming, he is portrayed as an Elf of Rivendell rather than [[Mirkwood]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears in his original role at the Last Bridge, voiced by [[John Webb]]. Because the part of [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] was cut, the heavily wounded Frodo says the [[Quenya]] greeting ''Elen síla lúmenn' omientielvo'' to him, and Glorfindel replies with Gildor's answer. Glorfindel keeps his two [[Sindarin]] lines, ''A na vedui, Dúnadan!'' and ''Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!'', though he says them with a heavy English accent. Glorfindel's role at the Council of Elrond is omitted.  His name is pronounced correctly in the adaptation, but in the credits, his name is pronounced "Glorfindle".

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is a powerful playable character once [[the One Ring|the Ring]] passes the [[Last Bridge]], who leads the Fellowship to [[Rivendell]]. 

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:To limit the already large number of one-appearance characters, Glorfindel has been omitted in this adaptation as well. [[Peter Jackson]] decided to have [[Arwen]] meet the travellers and then ride on [[Asfaloth]].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears on the Last Bridge. He has several Sindarin lines: ''A na vedui, Dúnadan'', like in the book, and ''Mae govannen, mellon'' (which Frodo accurately translates as "Well met, friend"). He comes to the aid of the hobbits at the request of Elrond, who had received news from [[Gildor|a group of Elves travelling near the Shire]] - even though there is no mention of that group earlier in the gameplay. Glorfindel does so in a monotonous voice, and his speech continues without pause. He also uses the lines ''Noro lim, Asfaloth'', though he does not say them to his horse: he says them to Frodo. No actor is specified for this part.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:[[Decipher]] made two [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game|cards]] featuring extra [[Jarl Benzon]] as Glorfindel, one of them being at the Coronation of Elessar.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://scrapbook.theonering.net/scrapbook/movies/characters/other/view/12658|articlename=Glorfindel's Cameo in ROTK!|dated=|website=TORN|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323204416/http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/04/040504lotrwetafalconer.html|articlename=The Making of the Weta "Book Cards": An Interview With Weta Workshop's Daniel Falconer|dated=5 April 2004|website=Decipher.com (archived)|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref>  He is briefly seen in the film at Aragorn's coronation when Arwen is revealed.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the [[War of the Ring]]. Together with [[Glóin]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], Glorfindel fights in several places in northern [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]]. He is voiced by [[Jason Carter]], and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of [[Arvedui]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]]. He has long blond hair and wears a white robe with purple belt. He is involved in some of the book quests for ''Shadows of Angmar''. The player also talks to him after defeating the balrog Thaurlach.

'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game). Glorfindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.

==Collectibles==
[[Gentle Giant]] produced a ''Glorfindel Mini Bust'' for [[Comic-Con 2007]], based on Glorfindel's appearance in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|EA's ''The Battle for Middle-earth II'']].
