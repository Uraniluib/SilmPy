==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The official Tolkien diary, this year containing 16 magnificent landscape paintings by renowned artist Ted Nasmith, selected from ‘The Silmarillion’ by J.R.R. Tolkien, together with a wealth of information and extracts from Tolkien’s work.<br/><br/>J R R Tolkien’s THE SILMARILLION is the core work of the Middle-earth canon. It is in this complex masterpiece that the history and background for THE HOBBIT and, particularly, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is documented.<br/><br/>It contains fabulous tales of heroes and monsters, and the history of the Elves and of the Silmarils – the magical jewels produced by one of the greatest of the Elves, which were stolen by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord; it tells of the creation of Middle-earth, and the coming of Men into the world; it chronicles the early battles between good and evil, forces of light and dark, which foreshadow the great conflict with Sauron in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It also includes a version of the tale of the Children of Húrin, and Túrin’s titanic confrontation with the mighty dragon, Glaurung, the agent of Morgoth.<br/><br/>These tales of Middle-earth were published posthumously in 1977, and when the book was recently reset, acclaimed Tolkien artist Ted Nasmith was commissioned to produce a total of almost 50 breathtaking paintings to accompany these spectacular stories.<br/><br/>It is from these that the new Tolkien Diary has been compliled, and these are accompanied by a wealth of information about Tolkien and his works, together with an extensive array of public holidays and notable dates from around the world.}}
