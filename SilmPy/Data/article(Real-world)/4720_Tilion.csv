'''Tilion''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtili.on]}}) was a [[Maiar|Maia]] who guided the [[Moon]].



==History==
In the days of the trees in [[Valinor]], Tilion had been a hunter from the company of [[Oromë]]. Though he often rode with Oromë, he spent much of his free time in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]], under the light of [[Telperion]]. Tilion loved silver (he even used a silver [[bow]]), and he begged to be given the care of the [[Moon]]. The [[Valar]] gave him the task. He was said to be less mighty than [[Arien]], the Maia chosen to guide the [[Sun]].

Tilion was reckless at times, and did not always follow the correct path, causing the Moon to be at times in the sky at the same time as the Sun, or not appear at all.

He was also drawn by the splendour of Arien, and sought to come near her, though "the flame of Anar scorched him, and the island of the Moon was darkened".

[[Morgoth]], who hated the new lights, sent [[spirits of shadows]] against Tilion, but Tilion vanquished them in a strife in [[Ilmen]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name means "the Horned", containing the [[root]] [[TIL]] plus the masculine ending [[-ion]].<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>
