'''''O Gnomo''''' was the first Portuguese edition of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', translated by [[Maria Isabel Braga]] and [[Mário Braga]] and illustrated by [[António Quadros]].

On [[20 March]] [[1963]] Alina Dadlez wrote to Tolkien and sent him five copies of ''O Gnomo''. She apologized that the word 'hobbit' had been translated, since Tolkien had sent letters saying that he preferred the use of the term 'hobito' and not 'Gnome' or 'Gnomo' for the first Spanish edition [[El hobito]].<ref name=C>{{CG|C}}, pp. 604</ref>

In [[1966]] Tolkien had in his private library four copies of this book.<ref name=>[http://img04.pars04.fr.topfoto.co.uk/imageflows/imagepreview-if3/t=topfoto&f=ARP1188397&z=540 Topfoto picture]</ref>

Only one edition of ''O Gnomo'' was published. A second Portuguese translation did not appear until [[1976]] in Brazil (''O Hobbit'', published by Artenova) and [[1985]] in Portugal (''O Hobbit'', published by Europa-américa).
