{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Wheeler,<br/><br/>Thank you for your letter. I hope you will not think that I am ungrateful for your attention and good wishes if I say that I do not feel able to write anything such as you wish. I do wish you well, but I do not think that it would really do you much good to have special good wishes from me.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>JRR Tolkien}}
