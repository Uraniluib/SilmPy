==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Three rings to elven kings 
Under the sky, seven for the dwarf lords in halls of stone 
Nine for mortal men doomed to die 
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne 

In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie 
One Ring to rule them all 
One Ring to find them 
One Ring to bring them all 
And in darkness bind them 
In the land of Mordor 
where shadows lie
</poem>
