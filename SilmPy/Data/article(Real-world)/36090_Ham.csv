'''Ham''' was the village where [[Farmer Giles]] lived.  It sat some twenty leagues from the capital of the [[Middle Kingdom]].  Besides the redoubtable farmer and his wife [[Agatha]], notable people of the village were the parson, the miller, and [[Fabricius Cunctator]] the blacksmith.  In the middle of town was a church where the [[dragons#Other fiction|dragon]] [[Chrysophylax]] surrendered to Giles.  There was a bridge over the river on one side of the village, where Giles met King [[Augustus Bonifacius]] and where the [[Battle of the Bridge]] was "fought".<ref>[[J.R.R.
