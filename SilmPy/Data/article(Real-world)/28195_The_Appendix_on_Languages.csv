'''The Appendix on Languages''' is the second chapter of ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', which describes the complex evolution of the material that would become [[Appendix F]], published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  Originally this material was to be included in the Prologue; since the Prologue was at first referred to as a Foreword, [[Christopher Tolkien]] labeled the first version F*.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 24</ref>  Subsequent versions of this material were relegated to the appendices so Christopher labeled these versions F1 through F4, with the subsection "On Translation" labeled A.

F* was originally prefatory information that would follow the original "Forward: Concerning Hobbits".  The text begins by stating that the story was written for those interested in [[Hobbits]], especially [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s friends, the [[Inklings]].  The work then veers into a discussion of the Hobbits' language, the Common Speech, and moves onward to the languages of [[Elves]], [[Men]], [[Orcs]], and [[Dwarves]].  Christopher believed that his father intended a dedicatory preface but was swept "involuntarily" into writing about languages.  Realizing that the result was an unsatisfactory combination, Tolkien put this text aside.  Later he would use elements of it in Appendix F and the ''Foreword'' to the First Edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.  Christopher included part of the First Edition Foreword to show how the material of F* was used.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, pp. 19-28</ref>

F1, titled "Notes on the Languages at the end of the Third Age", was a rough manuscript with many emendations.  F2, titled "The Languages at the end of the Third Age", followed F1 so closely with but minor changes that Christopher only included the latter.  However, F2 is of great interest to readers because it contains much information that was later excluded from the final version of Appendix F<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, pp. 28-29</ref> (the published version is only about one-third as long as F2<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 73</ref>).  The text of F2 is printed with notes and commentary by Christopher.  Some points of interest include:

* The term ''Lembi'' ("Lingerers") is used instead of ''[[Sindar]]'', indicating that F2 was written prior to mid-1950.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, Commentary, §3, p. 61</ref>
* In F2, the people of [[Númenor]] spoke Noldorin or, among high lords and men of wisdom, [[Quenya]].<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §9, p. 31</ref>  Christopher commented that it was extraordinary that in F2 the [[Númenóreans]] did not retain their own Mannish language.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, Commentary, §9, p. 63</ref>
* The chief power of [[Three Rings]] was to defend the Eldar living in [[Middle-earth]] from change, withering, and weariness.  From the time of their forging to the end of their power at the close of the [[Third Age]] the Eldar changed no more in a thousand years than Men did in ten; this applied to their languages too.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §12, p. 33</ref>
* The word ''[[mathom]]'' is related to the word ''máthum'' used in [[Rohan]], meaning "treasure" or "rich gift".<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §24, p. 39</ref>
* The Elvish ''Baranduin'' that the Hobbits changed into ''Brandywine'' was, for a time, refashioned as Elvish ''Malevarn'' and Hobbitish ''Malvern'', but then was reverted to the earlier form.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, Commentary, §25, p. 67</ref>
* "Shire" was originally a translation of Hobbitish ''Sūza-t'' while in Gondor the word ''Sūza'' was applied to divisions of the realm (I.e. the fiefs of [[Anórien]], [[Ithilien]], [[Lebennin]], etc.).<ref name="Fortyone">{{PM|Languages}}, §41, p. 45</ref>
* The word ''[[tharni]]'' was an old word for "quarter" and was used by the Hobbits for "Farthing".  The current word for a quarter or a "fourth part" was ''tharantīn''.  In Gondor a ''tharni'' was a silver coin that was one-fourth of a ''[[castar]]'' (in Noldorin the ''canath'' was one-fourth of the ''mirian''.).<ref name="Fortyone"/>
* The family name "Hornblower" in Hobbitish was ''Raspūta''.  The family name "Took" in Hobbitish was ''Tūc'', which the members of that family claimed came from an old word ''tūca'' that meant "daring".<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §42, p. 46</ref>
* The female name "Lobelia" was in Hobbitish ''Hamanullas''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, §46, p. 47</ref>
* The Common Speech word for a "bag" was ''labin'' and the name "Baggins", in Hobbitish ''Labingi'', was probably connected.  "Bag End" was, in Hobbitish, ''Labin-nec''.<ref name="Fortyseven">{{PM|Languages}}, §47, p. 48</ref>
* "Bolger" is Anglicized from the Hobbitish ''Bolgra''.  The Common Speech ''bolg-'' is much like English "bulge".<ref name="Fortyseven"/>
* The name "Frodo" in Hobbitish was ''Maura'', an uncommon name in the Shire.<ref name="Fortynine">{{PM|Languages}}, §49, p. 50</ref>
* The name "Meriadoc" in Hobbitish was ''Chilimanzar''.  Tolkien chose "Meriadoc" as the translation because the abbreviation of ''Chilimanzar'' was ''Chilic'',  which meant "gay or merry".<ref name="Fortynine"/>
* The name "Peregrin" in Hobbitish was ''Razanul'', which was shortened to ''Razal'' with the meaning of a small red apple.<ref name="Fortynine"/>

In the general commentary on F2, there was mention of a note dated [[9 February]] 1942 that specified:

* Language of Shire = modern English
* Language of Dale = Norse (used by Dwarves of that region)
* Language of Rohan = Old English
* "Modern English" is ''llingua franca'' spoken by all people except for a few secluded people and ill-used by Orcs

Christopher noted that this solved the problem, left from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', of why the Dwarves of that story had Norse names – they were translations of the language used in Dale that was as Norse-like as the Common Speech was Modern English-like.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 70</ref>

In a final comment on F2, Christopher noted that almost all of the exemplifications of Westron names were excised from the final Appendix F.  Whether this was because Tolkien felt that explaining the intricacies of translation was unsuitable or because of the constraints on space for publication is unknown.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 72</ref>

Christopher interjected a passage from a letter Tolkien wrote on [[3 August]] 1943 for it revealed that as late as this date Tolkien still considered the Common Speech to be mostly Elvish in origin.  Nine months later when Tolkien wrote the section of [[Faramir]]'s discussions on language Common Speech would be mostly Mannish with Elvish influences.<ref name="Seventythree">{{PM|Languages}}, p. 73</ref>

The third text, F3, was a typescript that reduced F2 to one-third of its length but did add some elements from F*.  F3 introduced a more complex account of the Elves in [[Mirkwood]] and [[Lothlórien]],<ref name="Seventythree"/> while at the start retaining the notion that the language of Númenor was Noldorin.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 74</ref>  However, Tolkien retyped a portion of F3 and it was here that the language [[Adûnaic]] was inserted.  He also revised and expanded the section on the Runes or ''Cirth''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 75</ref>  

A new title, "The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age", was devised for F4, which Christopher dated to 1951.  It is in this version that the terms ''Sindar'' and ''Sindarin'' finally appear.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 78</ref>   Tolkien added the only words known of the languages of [[Sauron]]'s allies - ''múmak'', ''[[Variag]]'', and ''[[Khand]]'', and introduced the new race of [[Trolls]] that only appeared in the [[Third Age]] -  the ''[[Olog-hai]]'' (with two early versions, ''Horg-hai'' and ''Olg-hai'', subsequently rejected).<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 79</ref>  Following F4 Christopher says were four more texts of Appendix F, none of which added any new material except for a translation of the Orc-curse uttered by one of Pippin's guards in ''[[The Two Towers]]'' chapter, "[[The Uruk-hai]]".<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 6, p. 83</ref>

Regarding the second section of Appendix F, "On Translation", Christopher identified two texts, which he labeled 'A' and 'B'.  In A, Tolkien reinstated part of the discussion on names that had been removed in the transition from F2 to F3, with some notes on the curious names found in [[Buckland]]. In B, Tolkien included even more material from F2.  Christopher concluded his discussion of the history of Appendix F by noting that even the copy sent to the printer contained many emendations, and he believed that had his father not been facing severe space constraints the form of Appendix F would have been considerably different.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, pp. 80-81</ref>
