'''Wystan Hugh Auden''' ([[21 February]] [[1907]] â€“ [[29 September]] [[1973]]), Anglo-American poet, was a long-time friend of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and the two corresponded frequently.

==Auden and Tolkien==

{{quote|I am [...] very deeply in Auden's debt in recent years. His support of me and interest in my work has been one of my chief encouragements. He gave me very good reviews, notices and letters from the beginning when it was by no means a popular thing to do. He was, in fact, sneered at for it.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Letter 327]]}}

In [[1955]], Auden sent an inscribed copy of his poetry collection ''[[List of books in Tolkien's library#The Shield of Achilles|The Shield of Achilles]]'' to Tolkien.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 480</ref>
