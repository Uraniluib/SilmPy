'''The Fellowship''' was a web-based Tolkien community, with real life meetings, centred around [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]].

==History==
The Fellowship commenced prior to the release of the films in 2002.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20020118153204/http://www.fellowship.nl/ (accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> Fellowship, and especially its forum, was very active through 2006. When the server crashed in 2006 however without available backup almost all information was lost.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20060221045007/http://www.fellowship.nl/ (accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> A smaller core of active participants continued with an alternative website that was started earlier in 2004.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20040902214006/http://www.fellowstuff.nl/ (accessed 06-12-2011)</ref>

As at 2011 there is very little activity on the new website and its forum. As at 2014 the new website was also defunct.
