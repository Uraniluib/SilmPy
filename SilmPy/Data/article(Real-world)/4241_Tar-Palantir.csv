}}'''Tar-Palantir''' was the twenty-fourth [[King of Númenor]]. His birth name was [[Inziladûn]] ("Flower of the West" in [[Adûnaic]]), the son of [[Ar-Gimilzôr]]. 
==History==
His father was a bitter opponent of the [[Valar]] and the [[Elves]], and had banished the speaking of the [[Elvish|Elven tongues]] in his realm. However, Inziladûn's mother, [[Inzilbêth]], was secretly a member of the [[Faithful]] and taught her son to be an [[Elf-friend]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Ar-Gimilzôr</ref>

When Inziladûn took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] it was a time of great darkness in [[Númenor]]. Ever since the time of [[Tar-Atanamir]], every King had spoken against the Valar and questioned the [[Ban of the Valar|Ban]] they had put upon the [[Númenóreans]] against sailing into the [[Aman|West]]. By this time, the Númenóreans's riches and power grew, but also did their fear for Death, and their joy and years lessened.<ref name=app>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

Inziladûn sought to repent of these actions of his predecessors and took a Quenya name in the tradition of his ancestors: Tar-Palantir ("The Far-sighted").<ref name=app/> Once again the [[Nimloth of Númenor|White Tree]] was properly tended, for Tar-Palantir's gift of foresight allowed him to ascertain that if the White Tree perished, then the line of Kings would also come to an end. The King also faithfully observed the ancient [[Three Prayers|religious ceremonies]] of the Númenóreans at due times. 

However, his actions were met with strife and rebellion.<ref name=app/> The Valar did not respond to Tar-Palantir's repentance because of the insolence of the Kings before him, and because most of the Númenóreans were still hostile to the [[Valar|Lords of the West]], and were led by [[Gimilkhâd]] and [[Ar-Pharazôn]], Tar-Palantir's own brother and nephew. Nor did Elven ships ever come from [[Tol Eressëa]] to Númenor again. Tar-Palantir became filled with sorrow over the continuing rebellion of his people, and began to spend more of his time at the tower of [[Tar-Minastir]] in the west of the isle, hoping at least to see Eressëa on the horizon. But even the sight of it was withheld from him. 

Tar-Palantir married late and had only one child, a daughter named Míriel. [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]] was named his official successor and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as [[Queen of Númenor]] was usurped by her husband, [[Ar-Pharazôn]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Palantir</ref>
