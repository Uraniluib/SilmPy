'''''An Evening in Rivendell''''' is the debut album by the [[Tolkien Ensemble]], released in [[30 September|September 30]], [[1997]]. It features songs composed to the lyrics found in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and forms the first part of what was to become a complete musical interpretation of all lyrics in the book (a project given approval by both the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[HarperCollins]]).

The album features cover art by [[Margrethe II of Denmark]].
