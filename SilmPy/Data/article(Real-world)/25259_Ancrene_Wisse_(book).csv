'''''Ancrene Wisse''''' is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s edition of the [[Ancrene Riwle]], a thirteenth century manuscript known as MS. CCCC 402 or MS. Corpus Christi College Cambridge 402 - A Rule for Nunnes or Recluses - Ancrene Wisse. The book also includes a Prefatory Note by J.R.R. Tolkien and an Introduction by N.R. Ker.

Tolkien was formally engaged by the Early English Text Society in 1935 to edit the manuscript for publication, but owing to endless delays, it was not published until 1962. The bulk of the book consists of a line-by-line transcription of the text, along with extensive footnotes.

3,000 copies were printed.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=51500|articlename=Ancrene Wisse. 1962|dated=|website=TB|accessed=22 September 2013}}</ref>
