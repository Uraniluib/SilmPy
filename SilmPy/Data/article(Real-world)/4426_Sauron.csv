<center>{{Quote|Sauron [...] was only less evil than his [[Morgoth|master]] in that for long he served another and not himself.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="SVala"/>}}</center> 

'''Sauron''' ([[Quenya]], pronounced {{IPA|[ˈsaʊron]}}) was the greatest and most trusted servant of [[Morgoth]] before and during the [[First Age]]. Originally a [[Maiar|Maia]] of [[Aulë]] named "Mairon", he was ensnared by Melkor and as "Gorthaur" he became Morgoth's lieutenant in his [[Wars of Beleriand]]. From his base of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], Sauron was directly responsible for the death of [[Barahir]] and later the [[Noldor]]in king [[Finrod]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]]. He demonstrated the ability to take the form of a wolf, a serpent, and a vampire.

After the downfall of his master, he continually strove to conquer [[Middle-earth]] throughout the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages. In the Second Age, under the guise of '''Annatar''', he deceived the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]], who under his guidance had created the [[Rings of Power]], whilst he secretly forged [[the One Ring]] in [[Mount Doom]]. Thus Sauron became "'''[[Lord of the Ring|The Lord of the Rings]]'''". His influence corrupted the [[Númenóreans]] - leading to the destruction of [[Númenor]] - which led to [[Elendil]] founding the Realms in Exile of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. Elves and the [[Dúnedain]], the descendants of the Númenóreans, formed the [[Last Alliance]] and, in {{SA|3441}}, Elendil and Elven [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]] died destroying Sauron's body. Following Sauron's defeat, Elendil's son [[Isildur]] took the One Ring.

In the Third Age, Sauron returned to Middle-earth and, as the '''Necromancer''', took the hill of [[Amon Lanc]] as his fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]; his chief servant, the [[Witch-king]], formed the realm of [[Angmar]] in the north of [[Eriador]]. Following an attack by the [[White Council]] in {{TA|2941}}, Sauron returned to his fortress of [[Barad-dûr]] in [[Mordor]]. By {{TA|3018}} [[Frodo Baggins]] was in possession of the Ring, and he was led by [[Gandalf]] as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in the [[Quest of the Ring]]. Whilst Sauron waged the [[War of the Ring]] against the [[Free peoples]] of Middle-earth, Frodo Baggins, [[Samwise Gamgee]] and now [[Gollum]] (who had lost the Ring to Frodo's  cousin [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]) reached Mount Doom. On [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}, they reached Mount Doom and the Ring was destroyed. The breaking of the Ring caused Sauron's ultimate fall and resulted in the start of the [[Fourth Age]] and the [[Dominion of Men]].

==History==
===Origin===
As one of the [[Maiar]], Sauron was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name="Ainu">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of Time, he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name="SVala">{{S|Vala}}</ref> Here he became one of the Maiar of [[Aulë]],<ref name="SVala"/> and was known as '''''Mairon'''''.<ref name="PE17.1">{{PE|17}}, p. 183</ref> 

Mairon's virtue was his love for order, planning and coordination, disliking confusion and chaos. But his obsession to order gradually overshadowed his love for the other intelligent beings of Arda, who would benefit from his planning; it became the sole object of his will, the end in itself. He started admiring [[Melkor]]'s power to realize his designs quickly and masterfully.<ref name=myths/> 

Early on (perhaps from the [[First War]]) he was ensnared by Melkor, becoming his greatest and most trusted servant.<ref name="SRings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Unlike his master, he didn't object to the existence of the World, as long as he could do what he wanted with it.<ref name=myths>{{MR|Myths}}</ref> Thus he came to be known as '''''Gorthaur''''' by the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] and '''''Sauron''''' by others.<ref name="SIndex">{{S|Index}}</ref>

===Years of the Trees===
After [[Morgoth|Melkor]] made his great fortress of [[Angband]] in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]], he appointed Sauron to be its commander.<ref name="SCaptivity">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> When the [[Valar]] captured Melkor at the [[Siege of Utumno]], they stormed and searched Utumno and Angband; they, however, failed to find Sauron.<ref name="SCaptivity"/>

===First Age===
[[File:Maureval - Mairon.jpg|thumb|right|Maureval - ''Mairon'']]
{{Blockquote|Sauron was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion was torment.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="SFingolfin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>}}
With the unchaining of Morgoth and his subsequent destruction of the [[Two Trees|Two Trees of Valinor]], the [[Sun]] first rose and ushered in the awakening of [[Men]]. Leaving Sauron in command of the war, Morgoth left Angband in secret to find the second-born kindred of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and to corrupt them to his will.<ref name="SWest">{{S|West}}</ref>

After the fall of [[Fingolfin]], Sauron launched an attack on [[Tol Sirion]]. Utter fear descended upon [[Orodreth]] and those who defended the isle. Sauron assailed [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] and turned it into a watch tower for Morgoth. Therein Sauron sat and Tol Sirion the fair became [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the Isle of Werewolves.<ref name="SFingolfin"/>

Upon hearing of the deeds of [[Barahir]] and his companions, Morgoth ordered Sauron to find and kill them. [[Gorlim]], one of Barahir's companions, was captured and brought before Sauron. There Sauron promised that he would free Gorlim and his wife [[Eilinel]] in return for information. Under the terror of Sauron's eyes, Gorlim revealed everything he knew and thus the hiding place of Barahir was betrayed to the enemy. Subsequently, Sauron revealed Eilinel was dead and had Gorlim put to death.<ref name="Beren">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

[[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]], promised to avenge his father's death. He wandered [[Dorthonion]] as an outlaw and achieved great deeds that were heard far and wide. Thus Morgoth set a high price on his head and Sauron, commanding a great army of [[werewolves]] and [[fell beasts]], sought for Beren.<ref name="Beren"/>

Later, [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], Beren, and their ten companions left [[Nargothrond]] in search of the [[Silmarils]]. Despite their being disguised as Orcs, Sauron espied them as they entered into the vale between [[Ered Wethrin]] and [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] and was suspicious as Orcs passing were supposed to report to him. He had them captured and they were brought to him. There Finrod and Sauron fought in songs of power; the strength of both was great, but Sauron was more powerful. He then stripped them of their Orc disguise but failed to discern who they were. He had them thrown into a dark pit where one by one they were devoured by a werewolf. Withstanding this horror, they refused to betray one another.<ref name="Beren"/>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Huan Subdues Sauron.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Huan Subdues Sauron'']]
When all of their companions were dead, Finrod and Beren were the last who remained alive in Sauron's pit. When a werewolf went to attack Beren, Finrod Felegund used all his power to defeat it. In this he was successful. However, he was critically wounded and soon passed away. In that dark moment, [[Lúthien]] came to the bridge of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] and sang. From his tower of Minas Tirith, Sauron saw Lúthien and knew that it was the famous daughter of [[Melian]] and [[Thingol]]. He desired to capture her and hand her over to Morgoth. Therefore he sent a wolf to the bridge, but it was quickly and silently slain by [[Huan]]. He sent many more and each one Huan killed. Finally, he sent [[Draugluin]], sire of the werewolves of Angband. The fight between Huan and Draugluin was fierce. Eventually Draugluin fled and, before dying, he told his master that Huan was there. Therefore Sauron took the form of a werewolf, the greatest the world had ever seen, and went towards the bridge. So great was the terror of his approach that even Huan momentarily recoiled. Sauron leaped to attack Lúthien, but she drew her magic veil over his eyes afflicting him with fatigue and blindness, then Huan sprang upon Sauron and there they fought. The force of Sauron's malice alone left Lúthien weak and nearly unconscious, and the fighting was brutal and prolonged; however, he could not subdue the hound of [[Valinor]]. He was trapped within Huan's jaws and could not break free, even when he took the form of a serpent and finally his own shape. Rather than leave his physical form, he yielded to Lúthien, giving her control of the isle in return for his release. He then took the form of a vampire and fled to [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], filling the forest with horror.<ref name="Beren"/>

After the [[War of Wrath]], with the downfall of [[Morgoth]] and the destruction of [[Thangorodrim]], Sauron adopted a fair form and repented his evil deeds in fear of the wrath of the Valar. [[Eönwë]] then ordered Sauron to return to [[Valinor]] in order to receive the judgement of Manwë. Sauron was not willing to suffer such humiliation and so he fled and hid himself in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="SRings"/>

===Second Age===
[[File:Angel Falto - Annatar.jpg|thumb|right|Angel Falto - ''Annatar'']]

Although Sauron long knew that [[Men]] were easier to sway, he sought to bring the [[Elves]] into his service, as they were far more powerful. So, about a thousand years after the [[War of Wrath]], Sauron decided that the [[Valar]] had forgotten about [[Middle-earth]] and he once again turned to evil.<ref name="silm-rop">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

After lying hidden and increasing his power in secret, Sauron put on a fair visage, calling himself '''Annatar''', the Lord of Gifts, and in {{SA|1200}} he befriended the [[Elvish]] smiths of Eregion, counselling them in arts and magic.<ref name="lotr-toy">{{App|B}}</ref> He was never welcome in [[Lindon]] as [[Elrond]] and [[Gil-galad]] did not trust him and refused to treat with him (which included [[Galadriel]] too), although they never realised who he truly was. Elsewhere he was gladly received, especially in [[Eregion]] where the [[Elvish]] smiths learned much from him as their thirst for knowledge was great.<ref name="lotr-coe">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Under Sauron's tutelage the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], under the leadership of Celebrimbor, grandson of [[Fëanor]], became more skilled than anyone else, save for Fëanor himself. In the year {{SA|1500}}, when they reached the very height of their power, the Elves began the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], but Sauron knew all their secrets and in {{SA|1600}} - ten years after the completion of the Rings of Power - Sauron created [[The One Ring]] to control the bearers of the other Rings.<ref name="lotr-toy" /> For this he invested most of his own power into the Ring as he forged it.

But the Elves were not so easily ensnared, and as soon as Sauron put on the One Ring they and Celebrimbor were aware of him, and realised they were betrayed.<ref name="lotr-coe" /> They hid their Rings from Sauron and did not use them. Sauron demanded that the other Rings be given to him, for they would not have been made without his knowledge. The Elves refused, and the War was inevitable.<ref name="silm-rop" />

In this time Sauron became known as the [[Dark Lord]] of [[Mordor]]. He raised [[Barad-dûr]], the Dark Tower, near Mount Doom; constructed the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor to prevent invasion; and raised massive armies of [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and Men, chiefly [[Easterlings]] and [[Southrons]]. Sauron's power reached its zenith 700 years after Mordor's creation, in the 17th century of the Second Age.

The [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] was a bloody conflict which destroyed Eregion and devastated much of Eriador. Celebrimbor was slain and his body impaled on a spike paraded at the head of Sauron's legions. The Elves were pushed back almost to the Blue Mountains, while their Dwarf allies (who had also rejected Sauron) retreated behind the walls of [[Moria]] where Sauron could not assail them. Sauron was master of almost all of Middle-earth beyond the coasts, but the [[Númenóreans]], the powerful Men descended from the line of Beren and Lúthien, who lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth and Valinor, responded to the Elves' call for aid and sent a relief force. The combined armies rallied and were able to defeat Sauron's armies in Eriador after heavy fighting, and the Dark Lord fled back to Mordor with little more than his own bodyguard and a handful of orcs.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Forging of the One.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Forging of the One'']]
As the Elves had failed him, he had decided to distribute the Rings of Power to Men and Dwarves. The Dwarves also failed him, as they proved too hardy and resistant to their corruptive power; however the nine Men were corrupted and eventually faded, being turned into the [[Nazgûl]] (Ringwraiths), his chief servants.

Nonetheless, while Sauron's subsequent power never quite matched the height it had during the War with the elves, many of his most powerful enemies' homelands had been devastated. ''Relative'' to his enemies, Sauron was actually in a stronger position than previously. His empire continued to expand to dominate barbarian Men to the far south and east. Throughout this, Sauron remained faithful in his old allegiance, building temples to the worship of Morgoth, where human sacrifice was practised. Because of this, towards the end of the Second Age, Sauron assumed the titles of '''Lord of the Earth''' and '''King of Men'''.

This offended the arrogant [[Númenóreans]] who had already started to fall under the [[Shadow]]. The proud Númenóreans came to Middle-earth with great force of arms, and Sauron's forces fled. Realising he could not defeat the Numenoreans with military strength, Sauron allowed himself to be taken as a hostage to Númenor by King [[Ar-Pharazôn]]. There, he quickly grew from captive to adviser and was known as '''Tar-Mairon'''; he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, becoming High Priest of the [[Cult of Melkor]]. He had the [[White Tree]] cut down and in its place raised a great temple in which he performed human sacrifices, persecuting those who were still [[Faithful]]. Finally, he convinced the king to rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself, claiming they would gain immortality. [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], the supreme god, then directly intervened: Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of Númenor was destroyed. 

Sauron was on Númenor in the Temple of Melkor and was caught in the ensuing [[Drowning of Númenor|flood]]. However his spirit survived, although severely weakened by the destruction, and (presumably carrying the One Ring) fled back to Middle-earth.

Sauron's spirit returned to Mordor, where he slowly rebuilt his strength during the time known as the [[Dark Years]], and he was unable to assume a fair shape. From this point on he started to rule through terror and force, largely filling the fearsome role left vacant by his former master.

Meanwhile, a few faithful Númenóreans, led by [[Elendil]], were saved from the flood, and they founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in Middle-earth. Sauron still considered them his hated enemies and he launched a pre-emptive attack on Gondor in {{SA|3429}}. These Men, led by Elendil and his sons, formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with the Elves of [[Lindon]] under the Elven-king [[Gil-galad]], and together they fought Sauron in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. The Alliance advanced against Mordor and defeated Sauron's forces in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and finally laid siege before [[Barad-dûr]]. 

The siege lasted for seven years until {{SA|3441}}, when Sauron left his fortress engaging in direct combat. Elendil and Gil-galad fought Sauron and vanquished him, but both were killed. [[Isildur]], son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claimed it. Later, the Ring betrayed him and was lost for more than two thousand years. After his defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, Sauron had lost his ability to form a physical body for a great while.

===Third Age===
Sauron's defeat released his subjects, like the [[Easterlings]], from his tyranny, but they fell into chaos. Their tribes and kingdoms battled against each other and some withdrew to the hated west.<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref> Weakened by his defeat and the loss of the One Ring, it is thought that he fled to the far east to regain his power and strength before returning. 

It was not until c. {{TA|1000}} that Sauron could again begin to take shape. Worried by this prospect, the [[Valar]] sent five [[Maiar]] from the West to assist the peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>
====Sauron's Return====
In {{TA|1050|n}} his power was enough that he began again to throw a shadow across portions of [[Middle-earth]]. Around this time he first began to inhabit southern [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]], choosing the hill of [[Amon Lanc]] as a place to build the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. At first, [[the Wise]] thought that it was one of the [[Nazgûl]] who had returned and taken up residence in southern Greenwood.

In the following centuries, his subjects in [[Angmar]], the [[East]] and the South once more concentrated against the Realms of his ancient enemies. Kings [[Araphant]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] realised that a single force was co-ordinating the attacks on both of their kingdoms and that they should work together to combat this evil. However Angmar was successful in destroying Arnor; When Angmar was also destroyed, by [[Gondor]] and the Elves, the Nazgûl gathered back in Mordor and subsequently captured [[Minas Ithil]], now renamed [[Minas Morgul]]; Sauron's final success was ending the [[Kings of Gondor|royal line]] of Gondor.
====The Watchful Peace====
The Wise feared that their enemy is active in Dol Guldur, and when [[Gandalf]] entered the fortress in {{TA|2063|n}} the power in Dol Guldur fled before him thus beginning the [[Watchful Peace]].<ref name=TA/> Leaving [[Khamûl]] in his place, Sauron fled once more to the East, corrupting the Easterlings and forging a strong alliance between their tribes, so that when he returned he was more powerful and had many Men in his service.

The Shadow on Mirkwood had lessened, but the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return and the [[Uruk-hai]], a new race of Orcs was bred in Minas Morgul.

Sauron returned from the east in {{TA|2460|n}} and again took up residence in [[Dol Guldur]] as the Necromancer. His return coincided with the One Ring revealing itself and [[Sméagol]] claimed it three years later. Feeling the danger, the Wise formed the [[White Council]].<ref name=TA/>

Sauron had captured the Dwarf King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and taken [[Ring of Thrór|one]] of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Dwarf rings]] from him. After centuries of pressing the [[White Council]] to take action against the Necromancer, [[Gandalf]] entered Dol Guldur in secret in {{TA|2850|n}} and learned that the Necromancer was Sauron. In {{TA|2851|n}}, the White Council were informed of this, and Gandalf urged an immediate attack upon the fortress, but [[Saruman|Saruman the White]] had learned of the presence of the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] near the [[Gladden Fields]]; he thought best to allow Sauron to build up his strength in order to reveal its location so that Saruman could seize it himself. Following his strategy, Saruman opposed Gandalf.<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref>

By 90 years later, Sauron had his minions look around [[Anduin]] for the One Ring and Saruman, always wanting it for himself, was worrying about it. In {{TA|2941|n}} Gandalf finally prevailed upon the [[White Council]] to attack Dol Guldur, and even Saruman agreed to [[Attack on Dol Guldur|drive Sauron out]]. By that time Gondor's forces around Mordor had weakened so much, and the [[Nazgûl]] had been preparing [[Barad-dûr]] for him, so it was easy for Sauron to flee and return to his ancient stronghold. The Dark Tower was reconstructed, and Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951}}. Following this, the White Council met for one last time to discuss the whereabouts of the Rings.<ref name=TA/>

From then on Sauron stayed in Barad-dûr from where he conducted his war on the [[Free peoples]]. Saruman, who was residing in [[Orthanc]], had secretly found and used the [[Orthanc-stone]]. Through the [[Ithil-stone]] away in Barad-dûr, Sauron linked with and subjugated his mind, and by {{TA|3000}} he had totally deceived and corrupted him.<ref name=TA/>

====The War of the Ring====
Sauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with or enslaved Men from the east and south. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and he was able at that time to send out his will over Middle-earth, so that the [[Eye of Sauron]] was a symbol of power and fear.

After torturing [[Gollum]], he learned that the One Ring had been found by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He sent his deadliest servants, the [[Nazgûl]], to [[the Shire]], only to find that both Bilbo and his nephew, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], had departed. Unbeknownst to Sauron, Frodo had, at the behest of Gandalf, joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] on a quest to destroy the Ring. He rallied his vast armies to conquer the resistance's strongholds, and sent the Ringwraiths to find and kill Frodo. At about this time, he also learned that [[Aragorn]], Isildur's heir, had also joined the Fellowship, and was rallying armies to defeat his.

When Saruman's army was defeated at [[Isengard]], Pippin looked into the Palantir of [[Orthanc]] and saw Sauron, who thought the Hobbit was a prisoner of Saruman. Later [[Aragorn]] used the Palantir to reveal himself to Sauron. Sauron made the premature conclusion that Aragorn had the Ring, and sent an army commanded by his strongest servant, the Witch-King of Angmar, to overthrow [[Minas Tirith]]. This battle would become known as the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

Although Sauron lost the Battle of Pelennor Fields, the free forces of the West were greatly weakened, and Sauron still had sufficient armies in reserve to ensure military victory. He was outwitted, however, by the strategy of Gandalf, who urged the captains of the [[Free peoples]] to march against Sauron, thus diverting the Dark Lord's eye from the real threat of Frodo, the Ring Bearer, who was nearing the end of his quest to destroy the One Ring. 

Frodo, however, failed at the last moment, unable to resist the power of the Ring at the place of its birth. Sauron saw Frodo as he put on the ring and, realising he had been tricked, sent the Nazgul to Mount Doom. But Gollum inadvertently saved Frodo by recovering the Ring in a desperate attempt to possess it, and then falling with it into the fire. Thus Sauron's power was unmade, and his corporeal power in Middle-earth came to an end. His spirit towered above Mordor like a black cloud, but was blown away by a [[Manwë|powerful wind]] from the [[Aman|West]]. Sauron was now permanently crippled, never to rise again, following his ancient lord Morgoth into the Void. <ref name="SVala"/> Saruman would suffer a similar fate.

==Appearance==
===Physical Form===
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] - ''Sauron'' (unfinished sketch apparently showing him just after the destruction of the Ring)]]
At first Sauron appeared as a royal and commanding figure in a strong body. He was also able to veil his power and change his shape. Later however he could take only a terrible form, of a stature slightly greater than a [[Men|Man]]'s,<ref>{{L|246}}</ref> "an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure."<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> [[Isildur]] recounted that at the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], Sauron's hand was black with a deadly burning touch.<ref name="lotr-coe"/>

===Eye of Sauron===
The '''Eye of Sauron''', called by various names, was the symbol of [[Sauron]] the Dark Lord following the loss of [[the One Ring]].  This symbol was adopted to show his unceasing vigilance and piercing perception, and was displayed on the weaponry of his servants, or at least the [[orcs]].

Sauron's Eye as Frodo sees it in the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] is the only feature of his later form described in detail. It is yellow and rimmed with fire, with a slit pupil, "a window into nothing."<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> The colour is compared to that of a cat's eye, but because of the references to Sauron's Lidless Eye, it may also resemble that of a snake, such as an adder. Readers differ as to whether Sauron's eyes were literally lidless and resembled what Frodo saw, or instead the Eye was only a symbol that Frodo saw in the Mirror in an elaborate form.

==Etymology==
{{Transcribed|Tengwar Sauron (Quenya mode).png|Sauron|Tengwar, Quenya mode}}
{{pronounce|Quenya - Sauron.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
{{Pronounce|Annatar.mp3|Ardamir}}
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Gorthaur.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
{{pronounce|Quenya - Mairon.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
'''''Sauron''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈsaʊron]}})<ref group=note>''Sauron'' is pronounced "sour-on" (''sour'' as in not sweet).</ref> is a [[Quenya]] name, said to mean "the Abhorred".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

Several accounts of the origin of the name ''Sauron'' were suggested in different linguistic manuscripts:
*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' ("foul, evil-smelling, putrid", from the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[THUS#Other versions|THUS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 393 (entry THUS-)</ref>
*deriving from Quenya ''[[saura]]'' ("foul, vile"; from root [[SAWA]]). The manuscript continues saying that ''Sauron'' "could be a genuine [[Sindarin]] formation from ''[[saur]]''; but is probably from Quenya". However, this origin appears to have been rejected, as it is followed by the comment "No. [[THAW|THAW-]], cruel. ''[[Saura]]'', cruel" in the manuscript.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 183-4</ref>
*deriving from the [[Primitive Quendian]] form ''Øaurond-'' (formed from the adjective ''Øaurā'' "detestable", from root [[THAW]]).<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 380</ref>
*deriving from '''''Thauron''''', which includes the [[Sindarin]] element ''[[thaur]]'' ("abominable, abhorrent"; also found in [[Sauron#Other names and titles|''Gor'''thaur''''']]).<ref>{{S|Appendix}} (entry for ''thaur'')</ref>

==Other names and titles==
'''''Gorthaur''''' ([[Sindarin]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈɡorθaʊr]}}) was a name used of Sauron by the [[Sindar]] during the [[First Age]],<ref>{{S|18}}</ref><ref>{{WJ|15}}, p. 240</ref> meaning "Terrible Dread".

In some of Tolkien's notes from the 1950s, it is said that Sauron's original name was '''''Mairon''''', "the admirable" ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈmaɪron]}}), "but this was altered after he was suborned by Melkor. But he continued to call himself Mairon the Admirable, or Tar-mairon 'King Excellent', until after Númenor's downfall."<ref name="PE17.1"/>

Among his many titles were the '''[[Necromancer]]''', '''the Abhorred Dread''', the '''Nameless Enemy''', the '''Cruel''',<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref> the '''Dark Lord of Mordor''' and the '''Lord of the Rings'''. The Dúnedain called him '''Sauron the Deceiver''' due to his role in the downfall of Númenor and the Forging of the Rings of Power.

In the earlier Legendarium, Thû was a name for Sauron used by Tolkien in some of earlier periods, particularly the Lay of Leithian<ref>{{LB|3|C7}}</ref>, where Thû replaced Tevildo the Cat<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>.

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
Prior to the publication of ''The Silmarillion'' Sauron's origins and true identity were unclear to those without full access to Tolkien's notes. In early editions of the ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth|Guide to Middle Earth]]'', Sauron is described as "probably of the Eldar elves."

Since the earliest versions of the ''Silmarillion'' legendarium as detailed in [[the History of Middle-earth]] series, Sauron has undergone many changes. The prototype of this character was '''[[Tevildo]]''', lord of the cats, who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', '''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'''.  Tevildo later (but still in the ''Book of Lost Tales'' period) was transformed into '''[[Thû]]''', the Necromancer. The name was then changed to '''Gorthû''', '''Sûr''', and finally to Sauron. ''Gorthû'', in the form ''Gorthaur'' remained in ''The Silmarillion''.

===The Necromancer===
In ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Necromancer is an obscure villainous entity mentioned fleetingly by [[Gandalf]] as one of the dangers of the wider world. He is peripheral to the plot of the book: explaining why the company takes the dangerous road though Mirkwood rather than going around, and providing a reason for Gandalf's absence for that section of the journey. Thematically the Necromancer, a truly 'terrible' force beyond the power of the main protagonists, gives the world of ''The Hobbit'' a greater level of reality which Tolkien felt was necessary for a 'fairy-tale' to ring true.<ref name="Letter17">{{L|17}}</ref>

Despite the alias it would appear that the Necromancer was always intended to stand for [[Sauron]], a figure from the very earliest phases of his [[Legendarium]] (as [[Tevildo]] in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]''). Shortly after the publication of ''The Hobbit'' Tolkien wrote:
{{blockquote|Mr Baggins began as a comic tale among conventional and inconsistent Grimm's fairy-tale dwarves, and got drawn into the edge of it &ndash; so that even Sauron the terrible peeped over the edge.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="Letter19">{{L|19}}</ref>}}

However, as ''The Hobbit'' was not originally intended to be integrated with Tolkien's wider mythology the Necromancer did not necessarily need to be consistent with his [[First Age]] counterpart Sauron, rather the two were loosely linked to add an 'impression of depth' to the narrative of ''The Hobbit''. With Tolkien's decision to merge the two 'worlds' and make Sauron the central antagonist ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' came the need to reconcile the two figures and account for his whereabouts in the millennia between the end of the First Age and his dwelling in Bilbo's Mirkwood. This was largely achieved in the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'', with Sauron becoming a much greater figure after the fall of his master, one who arguably drove the history of the entire Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth.

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
: Sauron is briefly shown in the prologue sequence as a shadowy figure in a horned helmet.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Sauron is played by [[Sala Baker]] and voiced by the late [[Alan Howard]]. In these films, he is depicted as a tall armored warlord wielding a huge mace (similar to how his master [[Morgoth]] is described in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''). In the first film, he is depicted killing [[Gil-galad]] (offscreen) and then [[Elendil]] before being defeated by [[Isildur]] using his father's [[Narsil|broken sword]] to cut off the finger wearing [[the One Ring]], as well as three others on the same hand. This strangely causes his body to explode, producing a shockwave that knocks everyone on the battlefield off their feet.

:Later on, [[Saruman]] implies to [[Gandalf]] that Sauron was unable to retain his physical form and that the Eye was his astral form, a detail which is never brought up in the novel. It is unknown if Saruman was truthful with this statement, or if he was either misinformed or lying (since he was already plotting to ally with Sauron at that point).

: Sauron is played and voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], under his assumed identity as the Necromancer. In these films, it is stated that the White Council does not discover he is Sauron until much later, during the events of these films, previously believing him to be a human with skills in magic. In these films, Sauron initially appears as a shadowy figure before assuming his armoured form from the previous films and projects the Eye of Sauron around his body.
