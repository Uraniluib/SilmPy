'''The Treason of Isengard''' is the fourth track of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' by [[Howard Shore]].  It starts out with a soft chorus with strings in the background, in [[the One Ring]] theme.  It quickly rises all of a sudden with strings in the foreground and brass in the back.  It has a walking or traveling theme, played by strings, oboes, and trumpets in the foreground and low brass in the back.  The "Merry Meetings" theme is then played on the trumpet with strings in the background, soft and gentle, launching right into the Fellowship theme in the same manner.  However, it soon grows deep and loud, with the Minas Tirith/White Rider theme played on brass and drums.  It runs itself out and slows down, followed by dark, long, notes on the brass that gradually crescendo into a new theme of loud chorus with drums, not unlike the Black Rider theme - designed for the duel of [[Gandalf]] and [[Saruman]].  The track ends on this note.
