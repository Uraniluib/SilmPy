==From the Publisher==

{{blockquote|The second of a two-book set that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien’s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.This second part of The Book of Lost Tales includes the tale of Beren and Lúthien, Túrin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin, itself the finest and most exciting depiction of a battle that Tolkien ever wrote. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay, together with texts of associated poems, and contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages.This series of fascinating books has now been repackaged to complement the distinctive and classic style of the ‘black cover’ A-format paperbacks of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.}}

== Contents ==
# "[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]" – the first version of the tale of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]
# "[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]" – the first version of the [[Túrin]] saga
# "[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)]]" – the only full narrative of the Fall of [[Gondolin]]
# "[[The Nauglafring]]" – a story which was "lost", in that it never was rewritten in full, and was mostly left out of the later ''Silmarillion''.
# "[[The Tale of Eärendel]]" – the only full narrative of [[Eärendil]]'s travels
# "[[The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales]]" – an essay about the changes in the framework, and the "unwritten" tales.
