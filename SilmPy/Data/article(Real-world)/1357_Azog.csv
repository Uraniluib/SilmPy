'''Azog''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain of [[Moria]], who started the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] when he slew [[Thrór]]. He was himself slain by [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], and was succeeded by his son [[Bolg]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref><ref>{{H|17}}</ref><ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>{{Pronounce|Azog.mp3|Ardamir}}

==History==
[[File:Pascal Yung - Azog.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Pascal Yung - ''Azog'']]
Of Azog's origins we know little; he was the chief of the [[Orcs]] of [[Moria]], and apparently the most important [[Orcs|Orc]] of the northern lands. The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to [[Moria]] by [[Sauron]] in about {{TA|2480}}. He had one son that we know of, [[Bolg]], who succeeded him after his death.

Azog entered history in the year {{TA|2790}} due to King [[Thrór]]'s desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt. Azog captured and slew [[Thrór]], and branded his hewn head with his own name, "AZOG".  He flung the head at Nár, then a money purse containing "few coins of little worth", warning that he would tolerate no future Dwarf beggars entering his domain at Moria.
  
When news of this reached [[Thrór]]'s heir [[Thráin]], he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of [[Dwarves]] to seek revenge on Azog. So began the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]: the [[Dwarves]] hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of war, the climactic [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] was fought before the gates of [[Moria]] itself.

King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and his son [[Thorin|Thorin]] were in that battle (it was here that Thorin gained the surname ''[[Oakenshield]]''). Near the end of the battle, Azog himself emerged and fought with Thráin's cousin [[Náin son of Grór|Náin]] and, after breaking Náin's neck, his young son [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]]. Though only 32 years old, Dáin swept the head from Azog's shoulders, and helped to win the day.  Azog's head was impaled on a spike, with the same coin-filled purse stuffed in his mouth that he had flung at Nár after he killed Thrór nine years before.

The [[Dwarves]] made no attempt to press their advantage, though, because [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]] had glimpsed [[Durin's Bane]] during his battle, and warned the [[Dwarves]] not to attempt to enter [[Moria]]. Azog's underground dominions in the north, though greatly reduced in the War, fell to his son [[Bolg]], who held them for more than 150 years until he too met his end at the [[Battle of Five Armies]].

==Etymology==
The meaning and origin of the name ''Azog'' is unknown. It is most likely a name in the [[Black Speech]] (e.g., the similarity between ''azog'' and ''[[nazg]]''), though [[Mágol]] may also be a possibility.<ref>{{HM|RB}}, p. 787, note 38</ref>

[[Andreas Moehn]] has noted an apparent but tentative link with [[Mannish]], in the [[Adunaic]] word ''[[zagar]]'' meaning "sword", in which case ''Azog'' might refer to "warrior" or anything similar.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Atani.html#Etym|articlename=Etymologies of the Atani languages|dated=18 July 2002|website=[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/M-earth.html Middle-earth Science Pages]|accessed=}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
: Azog is played by [[Manu Bennett]] via motion-capture and CG (though he was originally intended to be played by [[Conan Stevens]] in a practical costume and makeup<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150257180211558|articlename=Casting News for The Hobbit|dated=19-May-2011|website=FB|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}).</ref>). He is a white-skinned Orc, known as the Pale Orc or Azog the Defiler. According to [[Balin]], he is from [[Gundabad]]. In the movie, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] appears in a flashback. [[Thrór]] is still alive at this time and is beheaded by Azog during the battle. [[Thorin]] fights with Azog and cuts off his left forearm, and the Pale Orc is dragged off by a few fellow [[Orcs]]. Thorin believes Azog to have died from his wounds, but, unlike in the book, he actually survived the battle and serves as Thorin's nemesis.

: In the films, Azog speaks exclusively in [[Orkish]], whereas his literary counterpart was also known for using the [[Common Speech]]. He rides a gigantic [[Warg Matriarch|white warg]]. He also lacks the iron-clad head he featured in the books.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
: Azog leads a pack of Orcs on Wargs in hunting down [[Thorin and Company]] to wipe out the [[House of Durin|Line of Durin]] and to take his revenge on Thorin for his wound - even putting out a bounty on Thorin's head. In the film, it is his pack (not the Orcs of [[Goblin-town]]) that catch up to the Company on the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]; after a brief fight with Thorin, he loses them when they are rescued by the [[Eagles]].

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
: While still in pursuit of Thorin and Company as they come down from the [[Carrock]] and make their way to [[Beorn]]'s house, he is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] himself to lead his armies to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. He later leads an unsuccessful attack on [[Gandalf]] when the [[Wizards|Wizard]] enters the fortress prior to the armies' departures.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Azog.jpg|thumb|250px|Azog wearing armor in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'']]
: In this movie, Azog's appearance is changed, as he now wears plate armor, and he replaced his claw arm with one that looks similar to a sword. Azog is first seen marching on Erebor. When [[Bolg]] tells him of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elven]] Army, he orders him to Gundabad for more troops. From [[Ravenhill]], Azog commands the Orcs in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]] go to kill Azog, in order to leave the Orcs leaderless. But Azog captures Fíli and kills him in front of Thorin. Azog finally battles Thorin on a frozen lake and is knocked underwater. However, he breaks through the ice and stabs Thorin, mortally wounding him. Despite this, the Dwarf leader manages to stab Azog through the chest with [[Orcrist]] - finally killing the Pale Orc - shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.
