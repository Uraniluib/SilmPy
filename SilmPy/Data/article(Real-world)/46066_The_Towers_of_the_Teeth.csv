<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Win the battle, lose the war,
Choice of evils lie before for your feet
Retreat! retreat! reteat!

If you win, then you will lose,
Choice of evil's yours to choose, retreat!
Retreat! retreat! retreat!

You are standing in the eye of the storm.
Move an inch, and you'll be dead!
You are standing underneath the towers of the teeth,
And the eye blazes red!

Win the battle, lose the war,
Choice of evils lie before your feet.
Retreat! retreat! retreat!

You are standing in the eye of the storm.
Move an inch, and you'll be dead!
You are standing underneath the towers of the teeth,
And the eye blazes red!
