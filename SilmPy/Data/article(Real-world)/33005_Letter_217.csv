==Summary==
Tolkien told his publishers that it was quite impossible for him to write a lot of notes for Mrs. Skibniewska's use for translating ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  His preference was for as little translation of any names as possible.  She perceived, said Tolkien, that this was an English book and its Englishry should not be eradicated.  That [[Hobbits]] spoke their own ancient language was a pseudo-historical assertion and that inventing names for everything appearing in English was pointless.  Tolkien said all names of people and places should be left as they were.  Names that had a meaning in English could be listed at the end with explanations in Polish.
