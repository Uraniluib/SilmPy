==Summary==
===Introduction: West Gondor===
The player is summoned to speak with [[Éowyn]] at [[Dunharrow]]. 

===Chapter 1: The Must of the Rohirrim===
Éowyn tells of [[Aragorn]]'s decission to leave the [[Rohirrim]] and take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Several men noted the depart of Aragorn and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] and have started to despair. Éowyn asks the player to speak with three men of Rohan - Darláf, Bosa and Sidrac - and settle the unrest. Whilst comforting them, they speak about the Paths of the Dead.

The player returns to Éowyn, who tells the player that Two boys - Elfdag, grandson of [[Elfhelm]], and Radwine - watched the depart of [[Aragorn]] and his company. Elfdag challenged Radwine to follow them. Radwine returned to the camp after reaching the [[Dark Door]] but Elfdag went missing. Radwine begs the player to bring back Elfdag.

===Chapter 2: The Ruthless Dead===
Radwine escorts the player to the Black Door, where he enters the Paths of the Dead. In one of the tunnels the player meets Waldere, the only surviver of a party in search of Elfdag. He advises the player to look in the south-western tunnels. The player passes the corpses of Waldere's companions and eventually reaches the city of [[Oathbreakers|the Dead]], where he finds Elfdag. The player and Elfdag are attacked by several Oathbreakers, but they retreat after a fight with the player. The player and Elfdag then return to [[Dunharrow]].

===Chapter 3: The Whisper of Death===
Éowyn and the player learn from Elfdag that Aragorn summoned the Dead and claimed that he would lift their curse. Many followed him, but others - the Ruthless Dead - did not believe him and cast their lot in with [[Sauron]]. Éowyn is afraid that the Ruthless Dead will terrorize the people of West Gondor and aks the player to warn and protect the people of the [[Gondor]].

The player travels through the Paths of the Dead and arrives in the [[Blackroot Vale]]. In Morlad, a hilltop settlement in the Blackroot Vale, the player is welcomed by Celegdal. Celegdal and the player speak about the appaerence of the Dead and other strange omens in the Blackroot Vale and the indifference of [[Denethor II]] for the Blackroot Vale. The appearance of the Dead has led animals to go in a frenzy. Celegdal asks the player to kill ten frenzied animals before they are driven in the heart of the city.

===Chapter 4: Atop Erech===
After the return of the player, Celegdal tells of his feeling that a great evil came from the Misty Mountains and travelled through the vale. It has been rumoured that the Dead dance on the [[Hill of Erech]]. Celegdil asks the player to investigate the hill. The player finds tracks in the dirt and booted footprints on the hill that suggests that living persons had gathered on the hilltop. The player is interrupted by a stranger, Rovalong, who witnessed the gathering of a [[Rangers of the North|company of grim men]] and a host of the Dead. [[Aragorn|The leader]] commanded the host to follow him through [[Tarlang's Neck]]. Rovalong fears that a great evil has come to [[Gondor]].

====Interlude: Those Who Are Dead====
''In this quest the player controls the character Lûtkal, an Oathbreaker.''

The Grey Company travels through the Paths of the Dead and Aragorn summons the Dead to [[Erech]]. Lûtkal discusses the arrival of [[Isildur's Heir]] with Tenval, Drugât and Dûgden. The Dead are split on wether to answer Aragorn's summon or to throw their lot in with Sauron. Tenval desires redemption and argues that only Isildur's heir can lift the curse, Drugât and Dûgden on the other hand believe that only Sauron can save them. Lûtkal (the player) is uncertain.

If the player chooses to follow Tenval, Lûtkal answers Aragorn's summon and gathers with  other Oathbreakers at Erech. Aragorn commands them to follow him to [[Pelargir]] and free the land from the servants of Sauron. If the player chooses to follow Drugât and Dûgden, Lûtkal will be curses forever and becomes a member of the Ruthless Dead.

===Chapter 5: A Difficult Road===
Rovalong now introduces himself as a knight of [[Dol Amroth]] and tells the player that Prince [[Imrahil]] has marched to [[Minas Tirith]] with a company of [[Swan-knights]] and several hundred men-of-arms. [[Lothíriel]], Imrahil's daughter, rules Dol Amroth in his absence and sent a detachment of knights, including Rovalong, to protect the people in [[Lamedon]] and the vales of the Misty Mountains. Rovalong asks the player to follow the Dead through Tarlang's Neck and aid the people of Gondor, whilst he remeinas in the Morthond Vale.

On his way through Tarlang's Neck, the player meets Bandron, a merchant whose wagon broke down. Bandron sent his son, Nethadan, to the nearest town, Dínadab, for suplies but he has not yet returned. Bandron is affraid that Nethadan run into problems or a tavern. The player finds Nethadan, who was attacked by raiders, on the road and helps him to bring back supplies to his father. The merchant then asks the player to speak with his employer, Galengam, if he visits [[Calembel]].

===Chapter 6: The Merchant===
In Calembel, the player reports the accident to Galengam, who mentions that farmers in his employ have been attacked by raiders. At Galengam's request, the player then defends the farmers in his employ against [[Corsairs of Umbar|raiders]].     The player brings several weapons of the raiders to Galengam. After a critical look, Galengam recognises the weapons as weapons from the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. 

===Chapter 7: Abandoned Refuge===
Galengam suspects that the Corsair raiders have landed in [[Belfalas]] and have established a foothold in the [[Elves|Elven]] ruins of [[Edhellond]]. The player travels west to Edhellond. Near Edhelion, the player meet Lathlorn, who asks the player to explore Edhellond, kill a number of Corsairs and retrieve six Elven relics.

===Chapter 8: Dorthaneth===
After returning, Lathlorn tells the player that he is a member of the Avorrim, a group of [[Elves of Lindon|Elves of the Grey Havens]], sent by [[Círdan]] to maintain a watch on Edhellond. Since the last ships left Edhellond, the Avarrim have ensured that the docks remain free of debris and the paths clear. If [[Mithlond]] became untenable, Edhellond would be the only place from where Elves could leave for [[Valinor]]. The Avorrim were with too few to prevent the Corsairs from occupying Edhellond.

Lathlorn asks the player to inform Dorthaneth, the leader of the Avorrim, who resides in a cave near Edhellond. Dorthaneth welcomes the player and introduces him to a familiar face, [[Galdor]], who is currently a guest of the Avorrim. Galdor is worried of the fierce loyalty of the Corsairs for the "heirs of [[Castamir]]" and a person known as "the Scourge" and warns the player to not underestimate them. Dorthaneth notes that the Corsairs have not shown such loyalty for a long time but doubts that the aforementioned heirs trully descend from Castamir.

===Chapter 9: A Message for Lothíriel===
Dorthaneth tells the player that she has grown fond of Lothíriel, who often left the walls of Dol Amroth to visit her. Dorthaneth counseled her concerning [[War of the Ring|the war]]. Dorthaneth asks the player to travel to Dol Amroth and warn Lothíriel to not underestimate the "heirs of Castamir" and "the Scourge".

===Chapter 10: Keepers of the History===
After arriving at Dol Amroth, the player brings Dorthaneth's warning to Lothíriel. Lothíriel tells the player that she does not know much of the history of [[Umbar]], although she knows the story of Castamir and believes that his line has ended. Lothíriel echoes an advice of her father, that is "the finest way to combat a new foe is to learn as much of his history and temper as you can, before facing him on the battlefield." Lothíriel, therefore, sends the player to the library to acquire as much information about Umbar and the Corsairs as possible. During the research, the player learns from the scholar Nosseth that Lothíriel was betrothed to [[Boromir]]. After learning this, the player tells Lothíriel of the death of her betrothed.

===Chapter 11: The Swan-knights===
Lothíriel regrets that she sent many of the Swan-knights to Lamedon and the vales of the White Mountains, given the unexpected severity of the Corsair threat. She sends the player to recall Nedhros, in Belfalas, Heledir, in Lamedon, and Rovalang, in the Blackroot Vale. Rovalang tells the player that a [[Nazgûl]] recently flew above the Blackroot Vale. The player decides to defeat the Nazgûl, to prevent the enemy from learning of Aragorn's passage and the summoning of the army of the Dead.

===Chapter 12: The Shadow in Morthond===
Rovalang and the player climb the slopes of the hill of Erech. A saddled Fell Beast is on the top of the hill, but [[Nazgûl|its rider]] is not present. Rovalang and the player find and confront the Nazgûl, the Bane of Rhûn, before the entrance of the Paths of the Dead, waiting for Drugât's arrival. The Nazgûl recognises the player. Rovalang and the player are able to drive the Nazgûl away. They return to Dol Amroth and inform Lothíriel about the Nazgûl.
