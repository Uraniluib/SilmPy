==Summary==
Tolkien told [[Michael Tolkien (b. 1920)|Michael]] of his [[Mabel Suffield|mother]]'s family, who were from Worcestershire. Mabel - to whom Michael owed much - was beautiful and full of wit, but died too soon for her age (38 years old), due to disease and religious persecution.
==Notes==
Mabel Suffield and her sister were more or less erased from Suffield family history for converting to Catholicism. Tolkien considered this a grave misdeed against his mother. He would write of it again in letters [[Letter 142|142]], [[letter 250|250]] and [[letter 267|267]].
