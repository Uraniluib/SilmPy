'''Of Thingol and Melian''' is the fourth chapter of the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] section within [[The Silmarillion]].

==Synopsis==
The chapter is the shortest of all. It describes first the nature and habits of [[Melian]], a [[Maia]] of [[Irmo]]. 

We are told that during the [[Great Journey]] the [[Teleri]] lingered in [[East Beleriand]] while the [[Noldor]] were [[Neldoreth|further to the west]]. [[Elwë]], the leader of the Teleri while visiting his friend [[Finwë]] of the Noldor, was lost in the forest of [[Nan Elmoth]] and saw Melian dancing.

He remained immobile for the following ages. His followers could not find him so his leadership was taken by [[Olwë]].

The chapter concludes with brief references of the future of Elu and Melian, [[Doriath]] and [[Lúthien]] which will be expanded later in the following chapters...
