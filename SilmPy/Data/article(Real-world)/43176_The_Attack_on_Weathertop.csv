"'''The Attack on Weathertop'''" is the title of the tenth chapter of ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'', the sixth book of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series by [[Christopher Tolkien]].
 
Odo and Frodo<ref group="note">Odo and Frodo would later become [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]].</ref> find a dell in the northwest corner of [[Weathertop]].  In it they discover a store of firewood and (unlike the published text) a wooden case filled with [[cram]], bacon, dried fruit, and tobacco.  The narrative explains that [[Bilbo Baggins]] brought the recipe back with him from his travels and that [[Gandalf]] had taken to using it on his perpetual journeys.
 
Down from the summit come [[Trotter]], Bingo,<ref group="note">Trotter (a hobbit) and Bingo would later become [[Aragorn]] and [[Frodo Baggins]].</ref> and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] with the news that [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] have been spotted.  The five hobbits debate whether to stay or go, finally deciding to stay because of the firewood.  Merry asks if the Riders can see; Trotter does not know but points out that their horses can see.
 
The hobbits eat and take turns standing guard at the edge of the dell.  Trotter tells the others tales to keep them from becoming fearful.  When asked for the story of [[Gil-galad]] Trotter explains a little but declines to tell the full story.  Instead he tells them the tale of [[Tinúviel]], "the fairest [tale] that has come out of the oldest days".
 
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] at this point inserted a note to include either his poem ''Light on Linden Tree'' or some alliterative lines.  He wrote a prose summary of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] but then went back and inserted a new version of ''[[Light as Leaf on Lindentree]]''.  The poem is printed but would undergo many later emendations before final publication.  Trotter goes on to explain the story of Beren and Lúthien in a little more detail than in the published story, but without connecting them to [[Elrond]], [[Eärendil]], or the [[King of Númenor|Kings of Númenor]].
 
The moon rises and a dark shape is seen on the hill-top. Odo hurries to the fire, reporting two or three shapes moving towards them.  The hobbits arm themselves with sticks from the fire.  Three or four tall black figures advance upon them.  Bingo feels compelled to put on [[the One Ring]] and does so.  Immediately the three (not yet five) tall figures are fully revealed to Bingo. They rush forward and the tallest, wearing a crown, stabs Bingo, who feels a dart of poisoned ice.  As he swoons he glimpses Trotter leaping with a flaming brand; with a last effort Bingo removes the Ring and grasps it in his hand.<ref>{{RS|Attack}}</ref>
 
Christopher commented that in a sketch for this chapter the attack in the dell was envisioned before the idea of Trotter's song and story for the other hobbits (originally he was just to tell them about animals in the wild).  However, Christopher stated that here the full significance of the Ring had been attained.  This chapter was largely kept as is for the final published story, although the full scope of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was still absent and that the Ring might hold the fate of all [[Middle-earth]] was not present.  None of the great lands and histories east or south of the [[Misty Mountains]] had been conceived.  Christopher said that in October [[1938]] his father could still tell [[Stanley Unwin]] that he had hopes of submitting the story early in the following year.<ref>{{RS|1XU}}</ref>
