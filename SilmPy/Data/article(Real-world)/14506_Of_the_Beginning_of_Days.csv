'''Of the Beginning of Days''' is the first chapter of the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] section within [[The Silmarillion]].

==Synopsis==
Following the entrance of the [[Ainur]] as the [[Valar]], Arda was still lifeless and had no distinct geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by two lamps: [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]]; one in the continent's north, and one in the south. However the lamps were destroyed by the vicious [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. The [[Spring of Arda]] ended and the world was again darkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the perfect symmetry of Arda's surface. Two main continents were created that are of concern to the story: [[Aman]] on the far West, and [[Middle-earth]] to the East, over the Great Ocean.

Following this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in an enormous fortress, [[Utumno]]. He also surrounded himself with horrible beasts, many of them [[Maiar]] in the form of fell animals, known as [[Balrogs]]. Balrogs were to remain his most faithful servants and soldiers ever after.

The Valar then made for themselves a home at the utmost West, upon [[Aman]]. The chapter concludes with the description of [[Valinor]], the [[Two Trees]] and the roles of the Valar, more or less like ''[[Valaquenta]]''.
