'''Radhruin''' (died {{FA|460}}) was a member of [[Barahir's Outlaw Band]].
__NOTOC__
== History ==
Radhruin fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] under the command [[Barahir]]. He was part of a small group of men loyal to their lord that survived.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> The survivors formed a small band and lived as [[Barahir's Outlaw Band|outlaws]] in [[Dorthonion]], near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. 

They lived in hiding for some time, until [[Morgoth]]'s agents captured [[Gorlim]] and coerced him into giving the location of their hideaway. [[Orcs]] were sent to raid it, and succeeded. Radhruin and the other outlaws were killed. Only [[Beren]] survived, as he had been away on an errand.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>
==Etymology==
It's possible that the last part of the name is [[Sindarin]] for "flame".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 325, entry "Radhruin"</ref>
