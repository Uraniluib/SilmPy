'''Khîm''' was the son of [[Mîm]] and brother of [[Ibun]], who were the last of the [[Petty-dwarves]] to survive in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="Mim">{{CH|7}}, p. 131</ref>

==History==
One day, when out travelling with his father and brother, the three were set upon by [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]'s [[Gaurwaith|outlaw band]]. With Ibun, Khîm fled into the mist, but a stray arrow fired by one of the outlaws struck him as he fled. Though he escaped back to Mîm's halls beneath [[Amon Rûdh]]—no doubt with his brother's help—his wound was mortal, and he died before his father returned.<ref name="Mim"/>

Túrin and his companions came to dwell in Mîm's house, which became known as the [[House of Ransom]], in part because of Khîm's premature death. The archer who shot him, an outlaw named [[Andróg]], was cursed by Mîm, and forced to break his bow.<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 132</ref>
