{{quote|Too bright were the eyes of Arien for even the [[Eldar]] to look on, and leaving [[Valinor]] she forsook the form and raiment which like the [[Valar]] she had worn there, and she was as a naked flame, terrible in the fullness of her splendor.|"[[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]"}}

'''Arien''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈari.en]}}, stem ''Ariend-'') was the [[Maiar|Maia]] who guided the [[Sun]].

==History==
Arien was originally a spirit of fire whom [[Morgoth|Melkor]] failed to corrupt.<ref name="S11"/> In the days of the [[Two Trees]], Arien was a [[Maia]] maiden where she tended to the golden flowers in the gardens of [[Vána]]. She would water the flowers of Vána with dew gathered from the golden tree [[Laurelin]].<ref name="LR">{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 264-5</ref>

After the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], [[Laurelin]] managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. [[Aulë]] crafted a vessel to hold the golden fruit. Arien was chosen by the [[Valar]] to guide the vessel of the [[Sun]] above the airs of [[Arda]] to give light to the World; [[Tilion]], another Maia and one of Oromë's hunters, was chosen to steer the [[Moon]]. The Moon had already traversed the sky seven times before the Sun was finally ready. The first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the [[Pelóri Mountains]] of [[Aman]]. [[Morgoth]] was dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost pit of [[Angband]] and his servants withdrew. He sent up dark clouds of smoke to conceal his land from the light of the Sun.<ref name="S11">{{S|11}}</ref>{{rp|110-1}}

[[Tilion]] loved Arien and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat.<ref name="S11"/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In other writings, Arien's name was Urwen or Urwendi, which translated in "Maiden of the Sunship". She was one of Vána's maidens who took care of the tree Laurelin; her task was to water it. When the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees of Valinor]] were destroyed, she offered to steer the Ship of the Sun.<ref>{{LT1 | III}}, p. 73</ref><ref name="LT1Sun">{{LT1 | VIII}}</ref>{{rp|118}}

In [[Myths Transformed]], which changed the timing of the Sun to have been primordial to Arda's inception, [[Melkor]] wanted to claim Arien as a wife,<ref name=Myths>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>{{rp|380-1}} but when she refused him, he attempted to ravish her.<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|405}} However, she released her spirit and burned Melkor leaving him ashen and grey. The Sun was then left without a guide and caused uneven seasons and periods of excessive heat or cold in [[Arda]].<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|381}} In other abandoned writings, she was a Maia of [[Varda]]. 

It was told that Arien (Urwendi) and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into 'Fôs Almir', a bath of flame that would make one pure.<ref name="LT1Sun"/>

==Etymology==
Arien means "Maiden of Sunlight" in [[Quenya]]. It is derived from the root ''as-'', seen also in ''[[Áre|árë]]'' "sunlight"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''arien''</ref> and ''-[[ien]]'' feminine suffix.
