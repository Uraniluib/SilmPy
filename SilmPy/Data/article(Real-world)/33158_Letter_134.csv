==Summary==
Tolkien was anxious to publish ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as soon as possible as he thought it a great but not flawless work.  He only had one copy that he dared not post and planned to devote some days for final corrections.  He would retire from the noise and stench of Holywell to his son's cottage<ref group="note">The cottage belonged to [[Michael Tolkien (b. 1920)|Michael Tolkien]].</ref> on Chilterntop to do the work.  After returning on 10 September, Tolkien offered to call upon Rayner with his burden or, as Rayner had kindly suggested, Rayner could visit him.

Recently Tolkien had made some tape-recordings of parts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  He had been much surprised at their effectiveness as recitations and his ability as a narrator, claiming he did a pretty [[Gollum]] and [[Treebeard]].  Could the BBC be interested?

Tolkien wished to come to London but was pressed for time.  He was cutting the seventh International Congress of Linguists because of overdue professional work at [[Cambridge]], the W.P. Ker lecture at Glasgow, ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|Sir Gawain]]'', and new lectures.  Rayner's continued interest cheered him.  Tolkien mentioned constant "fan-mail" which asked for more, often more about the [[Necromancer]], which his new work certainly fulfilled.
