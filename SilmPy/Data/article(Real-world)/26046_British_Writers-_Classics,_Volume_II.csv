The Scribner Writers Series has set the standard for literary reference for more than 25 years. In addition to addressing the lives and careers of important writers, the articles discuss the themes and a styles of major works and place them in pertinent historical, social and political concerns for today's readers. Novelists, playwrights, essayists, poets, short story writers, and more recently, genre writers in science fiction and mystery, are all expertly discussed in the more than 17 sets comprising this series. 

Volume 2 includes coverage of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway," J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" and Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot."
