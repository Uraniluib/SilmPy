'''Goldberry''', the "River-daughter", was the wife of [[Tom Bombadil]].

==History==
Although her origins are uncertain, it has been speculated that she is a [[Spirits (creatures)|river-spirit]] of the river [[Withywindle]]. Otherwise, she and Bombadil are enigmas.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/Bombadil4Spirits.html|articlename=What is Tom Bombadil? Viable Theories: A Nature Spirit?|author=Steuard Jensen|website=[[Tolkien FAQ]]}}</ref>

According to the [[Buckland]]ish poem ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', Goldberry was in the [[Withywindle]] when she pulled Tom by his beard under the [[water-lilies]] out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. The next day he came to the [[River-woman]] and asked Goldberry to be his wife, and the creatures of the [[Old Forest]] (the [[badger-folk]] and other animals) attended their wedding.<ref>{{AB|1}}</ref>

In {{TA|3018}} Tom Bombadil travelled to the lower reaches of the Withywindle to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions, and rescued them from [[Old Man Willow]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref> Goldberry seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the [[Hobbits]] back to his house, they found a seated Goldberry surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref>

Goldberry welcomed and tended the [[travellers]] to their home. The [[hobbits]] thought of her as a beautiful and calm being, with a beauty resembling an [[Elf]] but less exotic to their hearts. Her voice was described as "the song of a glad water ... coming down like silver". The hobbits would listen to her sing in a voice like rain, and they would imagine rivers and pools.

==Inspiration==
[[Tolkien]] wrote about Goldberry that she "represents the actual seasonal changes in [river-lands]."<ref>{{L|210}}</ref>
