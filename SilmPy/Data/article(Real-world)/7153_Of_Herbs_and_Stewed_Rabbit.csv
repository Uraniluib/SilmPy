'''Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit''' is the fourth chapter of the second book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Gollum]] proceeded through the desolate landscape of [[Mordor]]. Gradually, they noticed that the land was becoming greener, more fragrant, and less barren, and they welcomed the change. As always, they travelled by night and rested by day. They did not travel on the open road, but near it. They worried about their dwindling food supply. After several days, they arrived in a [[Ithilien|country]] full of woods and streams. Gollum coughed and sputtered in the verdant setting, but the [[Hobbits]] rejoiced in the reappearance of greenery and water. They stopped at a stream to drink and bathe. Again, they were troubled by hunger. Sam sent Gollum off to hunt some food for them all, reminding him that Hobbit food was different from the food the creature was accustomed to eating. Sam watched the sleeping Frodo, observing the fine lines visible on Frodo’s face. Sam acknowledged that he felt deep love for Frodo.

Gollum returned with rabbits, which he did not want to cook, preferring to devour them raw. Sam proceeded to make a nice dinner for himself and Frodo, calling upon Gollum again to gather wild herbs for his rabbit stew. Frodo awoke and saw the cooking fire burning. Sam informed Frodo of the nice dinner being prepared, but Frodo warned Sam about the dangers of fire in the open field.

Suddenly Frodo and Sam heard voices nearby, and they saw four tall [[Men]] wielding spears. The warriors wondered whether the Hobbits were [[Elves]] or perhaps [[Orcs]]. One of the Men identified himself as [[Faramir]], Captain of [[Gondor]]. The Hobbits identified themselves as [[Halflings]]. Faramir said that the hobbits could not be travellers, as uninvited travellers were not allowed in his land. Frodo explained the Hobbits’ separation from [[Aragorn]] and [[Boromir]]. At the mention of the name of Boromir, Faramir was startled and became stern.

Two men named [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]] and [[Damrod]] guarded Frodo and Sam, telling the Hobbits of their enemies, the [[Haradrim|Southrons]], who threatened to attack. Sam wondered where Gollum was. Suddenly, they heard noises of battle and the name of Gondor called out. Damrod announced that the Southrons were attacking and that Faramir’s men were setting out to meet them. The Hobbits climbed into a position where they could see what was going on, and they witnessed their first battle among Men.

Suddenly, Damrod called out for help from a large elephant-like creature called the [[Mûmak]], which arrived from the forest and crushed the enemy. Sam was pleased that he had seen his first [[Oliphaunt]], as the creature was called. Damrod told the Hobbits to sleep, as the Gondor captain would soon return and they would have to flee the enemy. Sam replied that the troops of Gondor would not disturb him when they left. Damrod answered that it was not likely that the captain would allow Sam to stay, but would instead force him to travel with the troops.
