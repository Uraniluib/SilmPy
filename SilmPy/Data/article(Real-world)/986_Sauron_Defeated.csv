'''''Sauron Defeated''''' is the ninth volume of the ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. The first section of the book, "The End of the Third Age" (also [[The End of the Third Age|published separately]]), comprises Part IV of ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|In the first section of ''Sauron Defeated'' [[Christopher Tolkien]] completes his fascinating study of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Beginning with [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam's]] rescue of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], and giving a very different account of the [[Scouring of the Shire]], this section ends with versions of the hitherto unpublished ''Epilogue'', in which, years after the departure of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and Frodo from the [[Grey Havens]], Sam attempts to answer his children's questions. The second section is an edition of ''The Notion Club Papers'', now published for the first time. These mysterious papers discovered in the early years of the twenty-first century, report the discussions of an Oxford club in the years 1986-7, in which, after a number of topics, the centre of interest turns to the legends of Atlantis, the strange communications received by other members of the club from the past, and the violent irruption of the legend into the North-west of Europe. Closely associated with the Papers is a new version of the ''Drowning of Anadûnë'', which constitutes the third part of the book. At this time the language of the Men of the West, ''Adûnaic'', was first devised, and the book concludes with an account of its structure provided by Arundel Lowdham, a member of the Notion Club, who learned it in his dreams.}}

==Title page==

The title page contains an inscription in Tengwar:

''In this book is traced first the story of the destruction of the One Ring and the Downfall of Sauron at the End of the Third Age. Then follows an account of the intrusion of the Cataclysm of the West into the deliberations of certain scholars of Oxford and the Fall of Sauron named Zigûr in the Drowning of Anadûne''.
