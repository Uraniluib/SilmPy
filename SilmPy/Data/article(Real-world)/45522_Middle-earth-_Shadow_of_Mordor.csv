'''''Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor''''' is an open world action-adventure video game developed by [[Monolith Productions]]. Released in 2014, the story takes place between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', acting as a bridge between the two eras. The protagonist's name is Talion, a [[Gondorian]] [[Ranger]] stationed at the [[Black Gate]]. Talion's family is slain the night the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] and his [[Uruk-Hai]] forces return to reclaim [[Mordor]], setting the Ranger on a quest for revenge after he is possessed and sustained from death by a mysterious [[Wraith]].

==Plot synopsis==
The family of Talion, a ranger who guards the black gates into Mordor, is brutally killed by the Black Hand of Sauron. Talion is also killed but is brought back to life merged with a wraith that gives him inhuman powers. He ventures into Mordor to exact revenge and to help the wraith find his past identity and what brings the two together.

== Gameplay ==
''Shadow of Mordor'' is an open-world action/adventure game that is set entirely within Mordor. The overworld is mainly populated by [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]], as well as never-before-seen creatures, such as the cat-like Caragors and troll-like Graugs.

One defining feature of the game is the Nemesis System, which allows the game to remember Uruks of a certain notability and track their progress as they rise from lowly soldiers to high-ranking captains and even war-chiefs. Most of these Uruks are randomly-generated and can vary in appearance, name, personality, and strengths/weaknesses. the Captains can randomly be found among the anonymous masses, though the war-chiefs can only be encountered by completing certain objectives to draw them out of hiding.

There are a number of tactics and strategies that can be exploited to kill Uruks: In addition to killing them in normal combat, one can also poison a nearby barrel of grog and let Uruk-hai drink from it, grapple them and throw them over the edge of a cliff or platform, set Caragors loose on them by breaking open their cages, launch sneak attacks from above or behind, or "brand" Uruks with the Wraith's powers to brainwash them and pit them against other Orcs.

== Differences between versions ==
The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are severely lacking in comparison to their counterparts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One: The PS3/360 versions features a simplified Nemesis system, poor framerate, longer loading times, and Graugs are very rarely encountered outside of missions. As such, the hunting challenges involving the Graugs and their variants are omitted from these versions of the game.
