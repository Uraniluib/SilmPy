'''''Tolkien in the New Century: Essays in Honor of Tom Shippey''''' is a [[Wikipedia:Festschrift|Festschrift]] for [[Tom Shippey]], published in [[2014]] on the occasion of his retirement from the Walter J. Ong, S.J., Endowed Chair in Humanities at St. Louis University in Missouri.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Widely considered one of the leading experts on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, Thomas Alan Shippey has informed and enlightened a generation of Tolkien scholars and fans. In this collection, friends and colleagues honor Shippey with 15 essays that reflect their mentor's research interests, methods of literary criticism and attention to Tolkien's shorter works. In a wide-ranging consideration of Tolkien's oeuvre, the contributors explore the influence of 19th and 20th century book illustrations on Tolkien's work; utopia and fantasy in Tolkien's Middle-earth; the Silmarils, the Arkenstone, and the One Ring as thematic vehicles; the pattern of decline in Middle-earth as reflected in the diminishing power of language; Tolkien's interest in medieval genres; the heroism of secondary characters; and numerous other topics. Also included are brief memoirs by Shippey's colleagues and friends in academia and fandom and a bibliography of Shippey's work.}}
