'''''Winter's Tales for Children 1''''', illustrated by Hugh Marshall, is a children's book which includes the poems ''[[The Dragon's Visit]]'' (pp. 84-87) and ''[[Once upon a Time]]'' (pp. 44-45) by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

A similar edition was published in the United States by St. Martin's Press.

Tolkien also submitted a third piece (a [[poem for Rosalind Ramage]]) for inclusion in the anthology, which eventually was omitted due to lack of space.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Douglas A.
