==Summary==
Tolkien said that his aunt's suggestion of a small book featuring [[Tom Bombadil]] was a good idea although he felt disinclined to write any more about him.  He thought the original poem, if illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], would make a pretty booklet.  If his aunt did not have the original poem he would try to have a copy made for her.
