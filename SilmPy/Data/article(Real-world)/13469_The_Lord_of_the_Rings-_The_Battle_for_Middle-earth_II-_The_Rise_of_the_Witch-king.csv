|}}'''The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II - The Rise of the Witch-king''' is a real-time strategy computer game published by Electronic Arts. It is the expansion pack to [[EA's The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]], from the same company. It was announced during The San Diego Comic-Con of 2006.

==Campaign==
The Campaign is set in [[Angmar]], where the Witch-King must unite the [[Black Númenóreans]] and the [[Trolls]] in order to create a massive army to fight against [[Arnor]]. After the fortress of [[Carn Dum]] is constructed, the Witch-King  conquers [[Rhudaur]] and [[Cardolan]]. Meanwhile, [[Glorfindel]] attacks [[Carn Dum]], and the forces of Angmar are weakened. After several years, the force of [[Angmar]] prepares for a last attack: the siege of [[Fornost]]. However, Prince [[Eärnur]] of Gondor, [[Glorfindel]] and [[Elrond]] make a final attack in [[Angmar]], slaying all the Witch King's servants. While semi accurate or even impeccably accurate the publishers did take some liberties especially in the names of characters that do not exist or that were never given a name.<ref> {{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsI8Nc9kEAA|articlename=The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king - Epilogue|dated=20 September 2009|website=YT|accessed=4 March 2012}}</ref>

==Differences from The Battle for Middle-earth II==
There are several improvements. The main improvement is the new faction, [[Angmar]]. Other improvements to the game include the new [[Trolls|Olog-Hai]] class of custom hero, improvements to the existing factions, and new hero units. The three sub-classes of Olog-Hai are the Great Troll, the Troll in the previous game, the Snow Troll, and the Hill Troll. The Good and Evil campaigns have been replaced with the single Angmar campaign. There have also been numerous improvements to the War of the Ring and Skirmish battles.
The hero units belong to all of the previous factions only. The hero units are listed as such: Zealots ([[Dwarves]]), Knights of Dol Amroth ([[Men]]), Noldor Warriors ([[Elves]]), Black Orcs ([[Mordor]]), [[Uruk-hai|Uruk Death Bringers]] ([[Isengard]]), and Fire Drake Broods ([[Orcs|Goblins]]). The hero units have a limit of only one to three allowed, depending on which type. Like the heroes, the hero units learn skills at certain levels, although not as many. They can heal like heroes, but if a single member dies, it will not respawn unless you either produce a new one or use the Heal power.
