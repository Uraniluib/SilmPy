'''The Hobbit-forming World of J.R.R. Tolkien''' refers to the title of an article which includes extracts from an interview with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The interview was conducted by Henry Resnik over the telephone, for the magazine the ''Saturday Evening Post'' (published in [[Saturday Evening Post (2 July 1966)|the issue of 2 July 1966]]).
