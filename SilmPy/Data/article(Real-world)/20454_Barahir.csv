'''Barahir''' ({{FA|400}} – {{FA|460|n}}) was a [[Men|Man]] of [[Middle-earth]], heir to the [[House of Bëor]] in the [[First Age]] and most famous as the father of [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], also known as ''Beren the One-handed''.

==History==
Barahir, was the fifth and youngest child and son of [[Bregor]] and he had three elder sisters: [[Bregil]], [[Hirwen]], and [[Gilwen]], and an elder brother [[Bregolas]]. Barahir married [[Emeldir|Emeldir ''the Man-Hearted'']] who was also of the [[House of Bëor]] through the line of [[Belen]] (youngest son of [[Bëor]]), and they had only one child and son, the renowned [[Beren]] the ''One-handed''.<ref name="WJwest">{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref>

In {{FA|455}}, Barahir fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] at the [[Pass of Sirion]]. Near the [[Fen of Serech]], he hastened to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]'s rescue with a small retinue of his bravest men. They formed a wall of spears around the Elven King, and cut their way out of the battle at great loss. Finrod was safe, and in gratitude, swore an oath, promising help to Barahir and his kin should they need it. To reinforce this oath, he gave Barahir his [[Ring of Barahir|ring]], which would become an heirloom in his house.<ref name="Ruin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> 

After [[Morgoth]] conquered the lands, Barahir contested his dominion. Gradually all of the people of that region fled until Barahir had but twelve companions left: Beren, [[Baragund]] and [[Belegund]] (his nephews), and nine close and loyal kinsmen, [[Radhruin]], [[Dairuin]], [[Dagnir]], [[Ragnor]], [[Gildor (outlaw)|Gildor]], [[Gorlim]], [[Arthad]], [[Urthel]], and [[Hathaldir]].  As Dorthonion fell under dark enchantment and was called [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] the desperate band retreated to the rocky moors above the forest.<ref name="Ruin"/>

In {{FA|460}} they were betrayed to [[Sauron]] by [[Gorlim]], tricked by [[Sauron]] into giving up the location.  Barahir and the others were [[Massacre of Tarn Aeluin|slaughtered]] near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. Barahir's son Beren alone escaped, since he was away on an errand when the outlaws' hideout was discovered. Returning to the camp Beren buried his father and pursued the Orcs who slew him. The captain of the Orcs had Barahir's hand with the [[Ring of Barahir|ring of Felagund]] on it when Beren found them; Beren killed the captain and retrieved the hand.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Barahir'' is a [[Sindarin]] word and consists of ''[[bara]]'' ("fiery; eager") + ''[[hîr]]'' ("master, lord").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 351, 364</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In such early manuscripts as ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' and ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the father of Beren was a [[Gnomes|Gnome]] named '''[[Egnor (disambiguation)|Egnor]]''', and was called [[Rog the Fleet]] by the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth|Melko]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 241-1</ref><ref>{{LT2|I}}, ''passim'' (cf. Index)</ref><ref>{{HM|LB}}, ''passim'' (cf. Index)</ref>

In the ''Grey Annals'' (written in the 1930s<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p, 3</ref>) Barahir was born in {{FA|402}}, two years after his brother Bregolas, and they were both the sons of Bëor the Old.<ref>{{GA|125}}</ref>  After ''The Lord of the Rings'' was written J.R.R. Tolkien overhauled the genealogy of the House of Bëor.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''The new genealogies of the Edain'', p. 229</ref>  Four generations were inserted after Bëor with Bregor made the father of Bregolas and Barahir (whose birth was now set in {{FA|400}}).<ref name="WJwest"/>
