"'''The Name 'Nodens''''" is the title of an essay by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], first published in July [[1932]] as Appendix I to ''[[Report on the Excavation of the Prehistoric, Roman, and Post-Roman Site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire]]''.<ref name=TB>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13560|articlename=Report on the Excavation in Lydney Park. 1932|dated=|website=TB|accessed=9 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 164</ref>

In his essay, Tolkien discusses the word ''[[Wikipedia:Nodens|Nodens]]'', which appears in three inscriptions found at the excavations in [[Wikipedia:Lydney Park|Lydney Park]]. ''Nodens'' appears to be the name of an otherwise unrecorded god. Tolkien links the name to the Old Irish ''[[Wikipedia:Nuada Airgetlám|Núadu]]'' and Welsh ''[[Wikipedia:Gwyn ap Nudd|Nudd]]''. Núadu was the King of the [[Wikipedia:Tuatha Dé Danann|Túatha dé Danann]], the one time rulers of Ireland. Tolkien goes on to trace the name in other ancient languages and finally comes to the conclusion that the name means either "the catcher", "the snarer", or "the hunter".<ref name=TB/>

In [[2007]], the essay was reprinted in [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 4|''Tolkien Studies'', volume 4]].
