INTRODUCTION

Havens of Gondor focuses on the great fief called Dor-en-Ernil, the "Land of the Prince." Comprising all the lands between the rivers Gilrain and Ringlo/Morthond and including the whole of the hilly peninsula called Belfalas, it is a strategic province blessed with fine ports and fair weather. It lies in the heart of southern Gondor and, aside from Lamedon, it is the westernmost of the Stone-land's wellsettled regions.

Gondor's two most famous havens, the princely city of Dol Amroth and nearby Elven port of Edhellond, are both in Dor-en-Ernil. Undoubtedly the most dramatic harbors in the South Kingdom, their history embodies the grander tale of the Gondorian seafarers and their Elven friends, and it mirrors the struggles of the region's oft-times warring peoples.

Of course, Dor-en-Ernil is home to many lesser havens, including the fine harborage at Linhir. Together these towns house many of Gondor's seamen, and virtually all the ships which do not weigh anchor in the three maritime towns along the Anduin River: the great port-city of Pelargir, Harlond by Minas Tirith, and Osgiliath. Dor-en-Ernil's ports also provide a major portion of the warcraft engaged in the struggle against the Corsairs of Umbar and Harad.
