'''William Huggins''', also known as '''Bill''', was with [[Tom]] and [[Bert]], one of the three trolls encountered by [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Dwarves]] on their eastward journey to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. 
==History==
Bill seems to have been the leader of the troll-band — at least, it was he who led them to the woodlands of [[Trollshaws]], according to his companions. It was [[Talking purse|William's purse]] that [[Bilbo Baggins]] tried to pickpocket as his first act of "burglary", an attempt that brought the entire expedition close to disaster. Luckily, [[Gandalf]] was able to trick William and his two companions into arguing together until sunrise, whereupon they all turned to stone.<ref>{{H|2}}</ref>
