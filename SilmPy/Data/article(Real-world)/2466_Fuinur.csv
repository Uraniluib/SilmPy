'''Fuinur''' was a [[Númenórean]] who had been turned towards darkness after [[Sauron]] had been brought to [[Númenor]] ({{SA|3262}}).  He then journeyed to [[Middle-earth]] and rose to power among the [[Haradrim]].  When Sauron returned to [[Middle-earth]] and assailed the realm of [[Gondor]] ({{SA|3429}}), Fuinur and a fellow [[Black Númenórean]] named [[Herumor]] apparently joined Sauron's forces.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>
