==Summary==
Tolkien and his wife had been amused by [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s account of the Wings Ceremony.  He wonder how his son had seen and remembered a quotation from the Exeter Book Gnomics.  Seeing Anglo-Saxon that Christopher had written had cheered him.

An evening [[Inklings]] event had taken place.  He had reached the Mitre at 8, joined [[Charles Williams|C.W.]] and the [[Robert Havard|Red Admiral]], drank a bit, then joined [[C.S. Lewis|C.S.L]] and [[Owen Barfield]].  C.S.L. was highly flown, all were in good fettle, and O.B. was the only one who could tackle C.S.L.  A most contentious evening that an outsider might have thought a meeting of fell enemies hurling deadly insults before drawing guns.  The audience had refused to hear C.S.L. discourse and define "Chance".  He had said, "If you die tonight youâ€™ll be cut off knowing less about Chance than you might have."  [[Warren Lewis|Warnie]] rejoined, "Every cloud has its silver lining."  Barfield did a short play on Jason and Medea, two excellent sonnets were read, "ghosts" were discussed, and the special nature of Hymns had been talked out.  Tolkien had stayed until 12:30.
