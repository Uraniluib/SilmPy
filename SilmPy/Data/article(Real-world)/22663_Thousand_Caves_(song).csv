<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Elven underworld 
Colours of the stars 
Their dens seal the love 
That lies above 
Elven underworld 
So far from the stars 
Their dens seal the love 
For the night and the skies 

Woods and wild 
Air and light 
Bones of the earth 
Crafted by the Dwarves 
Legacy of Naugrim 

Caves of Menegroth 
Dwarven illusions 
All the cold and grey 
Covered with green 
Caves of Menegroth 
Dwarven illusions 
Walls of golden fey 
Cover their realm 

For once their eyes can see 
The same harmony 
For once not to care the race 
Beards or ears, the brothers face 

Hammers of Khaz√¢d 
Shaped the moutainside 
Blasted like a lightning 
The skill, the neat, the pride 
Legacy of Naugrim 

Elven underworld 
Colours of the stars 
Their dens seal the love 
That lies above 
Thousand caves it's stalk 
Cursed by Sindar 
All the beauty's gone 
Under the waves
