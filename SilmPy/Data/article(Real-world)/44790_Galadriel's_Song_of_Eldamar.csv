'''Galadriel's Song of Eldamar''' refers to a song about [[Eldamar]], sung by [[Galadriel]] in her [[Swan-ships|Swan-ship]] in [[Lothlórien]] for the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>  
It runs thus:

<poem>''I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:''
''Of wind I sang, a wind there came, and in the branches blew.''
''Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,''
''And by the strand of [[Ilmarin]] there grew a golden Tree.''
''Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,''
''In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven [[Tirion]].''
''There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,''
''And here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.''
''O Lórien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;''
''The leaves are falling in the stream, the river flows away.''
''O Lórien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore''
''And in a fading crown have twined the golden [[elanor]].''
''But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,''
''What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?''</poem>
