{{lolcantos}}This [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Canto]] of the [[Lay of Leithian]] tells of how [[Barahir]] and his band lived as outlaws.  It tells of the snaring of [[Gorlim]] the Unhappy by a phantom of his lost wife fashioned by [[Thû]], and how under torture he revealed the secret lair of Barahir before being slain, and how Gorlim's ghost appeared to [[Beren]], Barahir's son, away on reconnaissance, and told him of his treachery.  Beren upon returning found his father and all his outlaw companions dead.  He marked the grave of his father with a cairn of stones, swore an oath to avenge his death, and then, following the slayers, recaptured the [[Ring of Barahir]] from an orc-captain who boasted of killing Barahir and lying to Sauron in order to keep the ring for its gold.  The Canto ends with [[Beren]] leaving [[Dorthonion]] in an attempt to reach the Elven Lands of [[Beleriand]].  This Canto includes one of the most praised paragraphs of the Lay, describing [[Morgoth]], recounted below.

==Concerning the Canto==

This canto may be considered one of the darkest and most morbid cantos, with first a vivid description of the horrors of Morgoth, one of the most famous paragraphs in the Lay.

:''There sat a king: no [[Elves|Elfin]] race''
:''nor mortal blood, nor kindly grace''

Then comes the hope of Barahir, and the stumbling of Gorlim the Unhappy.

:''But still there lived in hiding cold''
:''undaunted, [[Barahir]] the bold''
:''of land bereaved, of lordship shorn''
:''who once a prince of [[Men]] was born''

The carrion-crows add to the effect of horror, and the sense of panic and hatred is full.  Then comes the curse and despair of Beren, and when in the last he leaves the grave of his father, and heads south.  Finally, the famous lines:

:''[[Beleriand]], Beleriand''
:''the borders of the faëry land''

end the Canto and leave its tragic spell hanging.
