'''Denethor II''' ([[Third Age]] 2930<ref name="Elendil"/> – 3019,<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 89 years) was the twenty-sixth and penultimate [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]]. He succeeded his father [[Ecthelion II]] at his death in {{TA|2984}}.  Denethor was described as appearing noble and powerful, even to rival the lordliness of Gandalf.  He was proud, tall, wise, far-sighted, and valiant; "more kingly" than any of his predecessors for a long time.  He proved a masterful lord and a great ruler, seeing to all things large and small under his command.<ref name="A">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

==History==
===Pre-Stewardship===
Denethor was born the third child and first son of Ecthelion II, [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]], in {{TA|2930}}.<ref name="Elendil"/>

Denethor was a masterful man, but also a proud one.  When a northerner named [[Thorongil]], a year younger, came to Gondor and won Ecthelion's trust and affections, Denethor grew jealous.  Thorongil, a war genius and one who looked enough like Ecthelion to be his close kin, won the love of the people, so that Denethor's envy grew.  It is possible that he figured out that Thorongil was really [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], and with [[Gandalf|Mithrandir]] wished to supplant him.  He was not sorry when Thorongil vanished to the east.<ref name="A"/>

[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Denethor and Finduilas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Catherine Chmiel]] - ''Denethor and Finduilas'']]In {{TA|2976|n}} he married [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas of Dol Amroth]], whom he loved deeply, daughter of [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Prince]] [[Adrahil II]] of [[Dol Amroth]].  She gave birth to two sons: [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]].  He doted upon his eldest son, Boromir, while Faramir, his second son, with his actions and friendship with Mithrandir, often displeased his father.<ref name="A"/>  In the mean time, he studied the lore of Gondor, including the archives that only he and his father could access.  Part of his studies were devoted to the lore of the ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name="pal">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>

===Early Stewardship===
Eight years after his marriage, Ecthelion died and Denethor became Ruling Steward.  Denethor was not viewed very highly in the eyes of his people in comparison to [[Thorongil]], and moreover there were already dark rumours of power rising in the east.  For these reasons, Denethor looked into the long-forbidden [[Anor-stone]], seeking to surpass Thorongil and Gandalf in wisdom, and to keep an eye on them.<ref name="pal"/>  Because of the manner of his viewing,<ref name="pal"/> he was greatly strained and aged prematurely.<ref name="A"/>

Only four years after the death of Ecthelion, Finduilas died as well.  Denethor was grief-stricken, and became more grim and silent.<ref name="A"/>

The ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' showed him much of what he wanted to see, and his knowledge grew exceedingly, so that he was wondered at by the people.  But eventually Sauron, looking into the captured [[Ithil-stone]], discovered that Denethor was using the ''palantír''.<ref name="pal"/>  Sauron attempted to wrench the Anor stone to his will, but failed due to Denethor's strength of will, his integrity, and his right to the use of the stone.<ref name="pal"/>  But this caused even greater stress upon the steward's already weakened body, coupled by the apparent invincibility of Sauron shown him by the stone.  Denethor, meanwhile, looked not only at Mordor, but also probably to [[Saruman]], and extracted information from the wizard to his benefit, which Sauron was helpless to prevent.<ref name="pal"/>

He became blind to all struggles save that of him and Sauron, his people and Sauron's [[Orcs]].  He mistrusted all others who resisted Sauron but were not under his own rule.<ref name="A"/>  He wore mail under his robes, to prevent himself from getting soft in his old age.<ref name="siege">{{RK|V4}}</ref>

===Stirring of Trouble===
Faramir, his youngest, began to have dreams, speaking of [[Rivendell|Imladris]] and [[Isildur's Bane]].  Boromir convinced his father to send him, instead of his brother and in the end Denethor gave in.  Boromir did not return from his quest; he was shot by [[Uruk-hai]] on [[Amon Hen]] and Faramir and Denethor both heard the horn of [[Gondor]], several days later his horn was found cloven in two, and was found by watchers below the [[Entwash]], and brought to Denethor.  Denethor, desperate for the death of his Heir, looked in the Palantir more often than he usual and so it grew his despair.<ref name="A"/>

Knowing of the coming stroke of [[Mordor]], Denethor called in the [[Captains of the Outlands]] to defend [[Minas Tirith]].  [[Nazgûl]] began to fly over the city, out of view but still casting shadows of fear.<ref name="MT">{{RK|V1}}</ref>

Thirteen days after Boromir's death, Mithrandir arrived with the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]].  Denethor openly vented his rage at first, but at the same time was curiously attracted to the hobbit, a witness of his son's death, questioning him closely and suspiciously.  When Peregrin offered his service in return for Boromir's sacrifice, Denethor was pleased and amused.  After examining Pippin's [[Daggers of Westernesse|barrow-blade]], he accepted the hobbit's service courteously.  He then confronted Gandalf.  While they supped, Gandalf told of the fall of Isengard.  Denethor hinted at his own abilities to see what happened in the world.  He racked the hobbit with questions for an hour, and then gave his guests lodging.<ref name="MT"/>

===Siege of Gondor===
{{quote|Better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to my pyre. No tomb for Denethor and Faramir! No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like [[Pre-Númenóreans|heathen]] kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the [[Númenor|West]] The West has failed. Go back and burn! |Denethor II}}
Soon after the [[Rammas Echor|Rammas]] was surrounded and Gondor placed under siege.  Faramir returned from errands in [[Ithilien]], and told the story of his encounter with [[Frodo Baggins]], two days before, and of his journey to Cirith Ungol. At the name of this place, Gandalf himself seems to be extremely uneasy.
A discussion on the matter followed between Denethor, Gandalf, and Faramir, in which Denethor revealed he had guessed more than was said by his son. He noticed that Faramir had looked at Mithrandir to understand if he was saying too much.
Denethor knew about the Ring and he was aware of Frodo's mission. He accused Faramir of condemning his people to certain death and he told Gandalf that on this matter he would have decided to hide the Ring. Not to use it or to destroy it, but to hide it.

Noticing his son's weariness, Denethor allowed Faramir to rest for the night.

Denethor never said explicitly that he would have liked for Boromir to live and Faramir to die: when asked by Faramir, he said that he would have liked for their places to be exchanged, as if Boromir was in Ithilien he would have brought him a mighty gift (the Ring).<ref name="siege"/>

In a council held the next day, Faramir was sent to strengthen the garrison of [[Osgiliath]]. The decision was not taken by Denethor himself, but by the Council, lead by Denethor but to which Faramir took part, agreeing in the end with his father's will.

Faramir recovered the lost ground all the way back to the [[Anduin]], but soon faced fresh troops from [[Minas Morgul]] and [[Harad]], led by the [[Witch-king]], a master strategist and one of terrible presence.  Faramir was driven back to the [[Causeway Forts]], but these fell, and Faramir was forced to retreat, having lost a third of his men.  The retreat was dogged by the [[Nazgûl]], and Faramir was wounded almost to the death by a southern arrow thought to be a poisoned dart.<ref name="siege"/>

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Pyre of Denethor.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Anke Eißmann]] - ''The Pyre of Denethor'']] After [[Imrahil]] had brought him the body of Faramir, nearly dead, Denethor gave in to despair and seemed not to be interested into anything but his son's life. While the outer defences of the [[Pelennor Fields]] collapsed at many points, he looked into the ''palantír''; he found the Enemy stronger than ever on all fronts and feared that the Ring was in his hands. The sky is black and Frodo has been captured in Mordor.
Denethor suddenly seemed years older, and his will snapped.  He abandoned leadership of the city to Gandalf and [[Imrahil]], staying by his son's side in the [[Tower of Ecthelion|White Tower]], thinking that everything was lost for his family, his city, his people. [[Rohan]] had been cut off and could not come to their aid; the first circle was also in flames: this last piece of information was the final trigger for Denethor's suicide.<ref name="siege"/>

He prepared a pyre for him and Faramir in [[Rath Dínen]].  He was hampered in his aim by [[Beregond]], one of his own [[Guards of the Citadel]], and Gandalf, who removed Faramir from the pyre. When Faramir called his name, Denethor seemed willing to abandon his suicidal designs, but suddenly he raised up the ''palantír'' and prophesied the doom of Gondor, acknowledging that a new enemy was about to arrive: the pirates from Umbar.  In a final speech to Gandalf, he said that he would have liked for things to be as they had always been in his life: to be a ruling Steward of a free city, ruling in peace and with his sons masters of their own will. But if he had to see his city in the hand of an illegitimate King, and his son turned into the pupil of a wizard, than he preferred to have nothing and to decide how to end his own life.
He took the white rod of his office and broke it on his knee, casting it into the flames, symbolising the end of his stewardship and the end of the rule of the Stewards.  He then laid himself down on the table with the ''palantír'' on his breast and so perished.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

===Afterwards===
Faramir did survive, and the city did not fall due to the timely appearance of the [[Rohirrim]] and the [[Dúnedain]] with [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>  Faramir kept the title of Steward, but not of Ruling Steward, for he recognised [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] right to take the throne.
Saving Faramir, Eowyn and Merry's life using Athelas, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] was first acknowledge as the "King" by the people of Minas Tirith, before he could actually claim the title.
Faramir's reaction to his father's death is not recorded, but it is said that the news of his death wasn't given to him, during the first days of his recovery, in order not to grieve him.

==Etymology==
''Denethor'' was named after the [[Denethor (Nando)|Nandorin chieftain]] of the [[First Age]]. The name is [[Nandorin]] fit into the [[Sindarin]] sound range, and is said to mean "Lithe and lank".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 17</ref>

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Denethor, played by [[John Noble]], appears in a flashback in the film's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]]. He appears at [[Osgiliath]] shortly after [[Boromir]] completes his successful [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|defence]] of the city against [[Sauron]]'s forces and tells Boromir of [[the One Ring]] being found, urging his son to go attend the [[Council of Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]] and try to persuade them to bring it back to [[Gondor]] so as to use it in defence of their homeland against Sauron. Denethor also makes known his preference of Boromir over [[Faramir]], which would further play out in the next film.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Denethor appears almost entirely devoid of hope and highly irrational after learning of Boromir's death. He demands his remaining son go on essentially a suicide mission to reclaim enemy-captured Osgiliath and stubbornly refuses to light the [[warning beacons of Gondor]] to call for the aid of [[Rohan]] (Pippin lights it instead at Gandalf's behest). Denethor then claims [[Théoden]] betrayed him when Sauron's armies begin attacking [[Minas Tirith]]). In the book, the danger of his madness is that it seems to follow a certain logic; Sauron ''does'' have vastly superior forces, all of which he has surely shown to the Steward in the ''palantír''. His actions, however, do not immediately proclaim his insanity; the Osgiliath mission is less obviously suicidal, as the city has not yet been overrun, and the warning beacons have indeed been lit, although Denethor expects little help.

:When Faramir is brought back from Osgiliath on his horse into the throne room, seemingly dead, Pippin attempts to stop Denethor from cremating his son (and himself with him), who he is sure is still alive. After Denethor knocks Pippin away, he falls onto the fire, and, in flames, runs out of the throne room and off the highest ledge of Minas Tirith, killing himself.
