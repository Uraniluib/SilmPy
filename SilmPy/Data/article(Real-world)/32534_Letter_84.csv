==Summary==
Tolkien began writing ''The Lord of the Rings'' again but hit an error in synchronizing the movements of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and the others.  It took a day or two to figure out the problem and he anticipated tiresome small changes in many chapters to fix it.  At least, he said, he had actually begun Book Five, the last with about ten chapters.<ref group="note">Eventually there would be six "books".</ref>

The editor of the Dublin Review asked for some verse or narrative so Tolkien had sent him ''Leaf by Niggle''.
