'''Uppsala Tolkiensällskap''' is a Swedish Tolkien Society. Based in [[wikipedia:Uppsala|Uppsala]], Sweden. It was founded in [[1973]] and is (as of December 2012) the largest Tolkien Society in Sweden, having about 200 active members. The association is also known as Midgårds Fylking (roughly, "The Phalanx of Middle-earth"; "Fylking" also having the connotation of "Fylke", [[Åke Ohlmarks]]'s Swedish translation in ''[[Härskarringen]]'' of [[the Shire]]). Uppsala Tolkiensällskap publishes ''[[Månrunan]]'' ("The Moon rune"), which is not available to non-members.

Uppsala Tolkiensällskap is not a literary association; it rather focuses on social gatherings and events. Unlike many other Tolkien Societies, Uppsala Tolkiensällskap is a secret and private society. Entering the association is only possible upon recommendation by a member.
