'''Lotho Sackville-Baggins''' ({{TA|2964}} - {{TA|3019|n}}, died aged 55) was the only child of [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]] and [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>  For a short time at the end of the [[Third Age]] he assumed illegal control of [[the Shire]].

==History==
After Lotho's father, Otho, died in {{TA|3012}}, Lotho inherited his [[pipe-weed]] plantations in the [[Southfarthing]], ensuring his status as a wealthy Hobbit.<ref name=Scouring>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

On [[23 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> Lotho and Lobelia arrived at [[Bag End]] after lunch to take stock of the property and to obtain the keys.<ref name=Three/>  Soon thereafter they moved into the residence and Lotho began a programme of buying an excessive amount of property and goods.  The goods were carted away to the south by [[Men]] ("[[ruffians]]") from [[Isengard]].  When people began to complain about shortages the ruffians proceeded to assert Lotho's power over the Shire.  When [[Will Whitfoot]], the rightful [[Mayor of the Shire]], set out to protest against Lotho's activities the ruffians captured him and incarcerated him in the "[[Lockholes]]". With Whitfoot out of the way, Lotho began calling himself Chief [[Shirriffs|Shirriff]], or simply '''[[Chief]]'''.  Among the Hobbits Lotho was known as ''Pimple''.<ref name=Scouring/>

Lotho's "reign" over the Shire ended in [[September]] {{TA|3019|n}} when [[Saruman]] (called "[[Sharkey]]") arrived in the Shire<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> and took over Bag End.  Soon Lotho's mother, Lobelia, was taken to the Lockholes and Lotho was no longer seen in public.  When Saruman was ousted by Frodo and his companions, he revealed that [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had stabbed Lotho in his sleep.<ref name=Scouring/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Lotho'' represents an original [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]] name ''Lotha'' which was meaningless in contemporary speech.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
