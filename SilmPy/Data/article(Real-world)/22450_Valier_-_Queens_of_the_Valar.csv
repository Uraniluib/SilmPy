<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
One with the light of the stars 
Woke Firstborns of Ilúvatar 
One with the trees and the green 
Planted all the first seeds 
Hope for the others grief 
She will come in misery 
Ever-Young cares the blooms 
Her sister caused the sun and the moon 

Valier, Queens of the [[Valar]] 
Sisters and wives of divine 
Maid singers of the world 
Composers, creators 

One with the laugh and the dance 
Spirit maiden in the woodlands 
And one with the gift to heal 
Gardens of Lórien her realm 
Weaver from [[Timeless Halls]] 
Cast the fate of the other dawn 
All the stories within time 
In her clouds weaved with pride 

Highest of [[Ainur]] in [[Ea]]
First from [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]'s hands 
Masters of Menel 
Almighty of [[Arda]] 
[[Valier]], Queens of the [[Valar]] 

Seven mothers of the earth 
Concerned with life, tears and time 
Pure beings of great beauty 
Loving hearts, joy and majesty 

[[Varda]], [[Yavanna]], [[Nienna]] 
[[Vána]], Nesse, [[Este]], [[Vaire]]
