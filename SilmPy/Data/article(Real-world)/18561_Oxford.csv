'''Oxford''' is the city in which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spent a great deal of his life living in. Both ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were written in North Oxford.
==In the legendarium==
Oxford ([[Old English]]: ''Oxena Ford'') is referenced in the earliest form of the [[legendarium]], the ''[[Book of Lost Tales]]''. It was associated with [[wikipedia:Hengist and Horsa|Horsa]], son of [[Eriol]] and [[Cwén]]. The name Oxford is translated as [[Qenya]] ''Taruktarna'' and in [[Gnomish]] *''[[Taruithorn]]''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>

Much later, Tolkien signed as ''[[Arcastar]] Mondósaresse'' "Tolkien in Oxford" in a 1968 letter to the producer of the BBC documentary ''[[Tolkien in Oxford]]''.<ref>Christie's, ''Valuable Printed Books and Manuscripts'', Sale 7275, lot 152.

According to a map of [[Middle-earth]] annotated by Tolkien, [[Hobbiton]] was at approximately the same latitude as Oxford.<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=3 April 2016}}</ref>
