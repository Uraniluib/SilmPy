{{disambig-more|Andúril|[[Andúril (disambiguation)]]}}
'''''Andúril''''', edited by John Martin, began as the second official bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]]. It became an independent fanzine after issue 2 (although issue 3 was distributed to Tolkien Society members). It then became increasingly less Tolkienian in scope. ''[[Amon Hen]]'' (the first issue titled ''Henneth Annûn'') replaced it as the Society's official bulletin.<ref>[[Charles E. Noad]], "The Tolkien Society — the early days", [[Mallorn 50|''Mallorn'' 50]], pp. 15-24</ref>

Issue page size changes from issue to issue (irregular). First three issues have subtitle: ''The bulletin of the Tolkien Society'', while later issues have subtitle: ''Magazine of fantasy''.
