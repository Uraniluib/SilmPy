"'''Over the land there lies a long shadow'''" is a prophecy spoken by [[Malbeth|Malbeth the Seer]] in the days of [[Arvedui]], the last [[Kings of Arnor|King of Arnor]]. It is recounted by [[Aragorn]] in the [[Paths of the Dead]] in the chapter "[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]".

==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Over the land there lies a long shadow,
westward reaching wings of darkness.
The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings
doom approaches. The Dead awaken;
for the hour is come for the oathbreakers:
at the [[Stone of Erech]] they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.
Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them
from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:
he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.
</poem>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Who shall call them from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:
he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.
