'''''Athelas''''' was the Danish-language journal of Danmarks Tolkienforening (later called [[Imladris, Danmarks Tolkienforening|Imladris]]). It was published between [[1993]] and [[1998]]. From the start and until [[1997]], its editor was [[Lars-Terje Lysemose]]. After Lysemose left, the last issues of the journal turned into a newsletter, which only survived about a year.

The journal was published four times a year (ca. 50 pages per issue). The journal can now be found at the Municipal Library of [[wikipedia:Aarhus|Aarhus]] and at the [[wikipedia:Royal Danish Library| Royal Danish Library]] (ISSN 0908-259X).

''Athelas'' was also annually published in English (ISSN 0909-1627).
