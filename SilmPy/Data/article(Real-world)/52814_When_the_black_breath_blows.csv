"'''When the black breath blows'''" is a poem of herblore spoken by the herb-master of the [[Houses of Healing]] in the chapter "[[The Houses of Healing]]". It is an old rhyme telling of the healing properties of [[athelas]], though it is considered by some to be little more than an old wives' tale despite the truth of its words.

==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
When the [[Black Breath|black breath]] blows
and death's shadow grows
and all lights pass,
come athelas! come athelas!
Life to the dying
In the king's hand lying!
</poem>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'' '''

The poem is recounted by one of the healers at [[Halbarad]]'s encampment at [[Sarn Ford]], though "athelas" is here mispronounced as "ah-THAY-lus" rather than "ATH-e-lass" as the poem would suggest.
