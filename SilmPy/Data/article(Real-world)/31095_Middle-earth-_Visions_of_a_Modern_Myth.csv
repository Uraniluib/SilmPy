==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|From the brush of Donato Giancola, one of the world's most recognized and awarded fantasy artists, comes a book filled with new illustrations that blend his legendary Renaissance craftsmanship with the visions outlined in J.R.R. Tolkein's [''sic!''] Middle-Earth [''sic!'']. Dramatic lighting and deft draftsmanship seemingly culled from the tableaux of great Old Master painters like Caravaggio, Rembrandt and Vermeer explain Donato's popularity with millions of fans and his numerous Hugo and Chesley Awards for his oil paintings. This long-awaited moving and beautiful voyage through Middle-Earth from a modern master of the arts will be a must-have for eager genre readers everywhere.}}
