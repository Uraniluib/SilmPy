<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Moves of the deep 
Senses of the beast 
Ancient people among the trees 
Soil of their land 
The way of the wind 
Throne and the walls for the Woses 

Be gone [[Orcs|Orc]]-folk 
Ruin Gorgûn 
Be gone Troll-folk 
Ruin Gorgûn 

Gold from the sun 
The wealth of the clan 
Riches for soul of everyone 
Rivers and lakes 
The silvering moon 
Kingdom of pearls their woods 

Drain the hope from the souls 
Of Orcish hordes when they are dead 
Drain the life from their own earth 
From the stars, from every birth 

[[Drúedain|Drúadan]] chieftain 
[[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] 
Wise from his mind 
Pure from his heart 
Druadan chieftain 
Ghân of the woods 
Fighting the wolves 
Fighting the Gorgûn 

Mother earth 
Caring for her child 
Forest folk 
Her untamed kind
