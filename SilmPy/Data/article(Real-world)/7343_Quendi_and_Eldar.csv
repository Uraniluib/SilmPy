'''Quendi and Eldar''' is a collection of short essays by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] dating from c. [[1959]]-[[1960|60]], which were published in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]''. ''Quendi and Eldar'' provides the etymological development of certain words the [[Elves]] used to name themselves and other peoples, or to refer to individuals in some way.

A large section of "Appendix D. <nowiki>*</nowiki>''Kwen'', ''Quenya'', and the Elvish (especially Ñoldorin) words for 'Language'" was omitted from ''The War of the Jewels'' by [[Christopher Tolkien]], but was released years later in [[Vinyar Tengwar 39|''Vinyar Tengwar'', Issue 39]] together with a shorter text entitled "''Appendix'': Noldorin words for Language".<ref>{{VT|39a}}</ref>
