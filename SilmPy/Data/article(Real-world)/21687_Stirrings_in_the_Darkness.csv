==Summary==
===Foreword: An Unwanted Guest===
The player finds [[Barliman Butterbur]] at [[The Prancing Pony]]. He informs that the person the player is looking for is staying at the inn. Butterbur is nervous about him staying at his inn, but he can't turn down good money. He whispers that the man goes by the name [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] and that he is a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. He gives the player directions to his room.

===Chapter 1: Unravelling the Thread===
[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] tells the player that they need to unravel the threads of the plans of the [[Witch-king|Captain of the Nine]]. There is a [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] camp just east of [[Bree]] where he believes that [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]], a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] whose alligance changed to Angmar, and [[Skorgrím]], leader of the [[Dourhands]], went. He wishes for the player to help him and his company end Amdir's life at night fall.   

At the camp Strider and the Ranger Lenglinn circle around the camp while the player and the Ranger Torthann attack the camp from the front. After defeating the brigands Torthann and the player encounters Skorgrím. After driving the dwarf out of the camp the party is reunited with Strider and Lenglinn. Togther they make their way deeper into the camp where they witness the [[Nazgûl]] changing Amdir into a wraith. The party manages to scare the Nazgûl away and then slay Amdir before the transformation could be completed.

===Chapter 2: To a Constable's Aid===
[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] is curious of the nature of [[Skorgrím]]. He mentions that dwarves are by nature honourable and cannot be dominated by the will of any. Strider requests the player to go speak to Constable Underhill in [[Combe]], report what has happened and investigate the Blackwolds old hideout.

===Chapter 3: Blackwolds Broken===
Constable Underhill informs you that the leader of the Blackwolds was William Skunkwood, but he has died. He agrees to investigate the old hideout and make certain that the brigands are not regathering their strength. The old hideout was a cave near Staddle Falls not far from [[Staddle]].

Constable Underhill discovers that [[Skorgrím]] and some Dourhand Dwarves are attempting to persuade the new Blackwold leader to join the forces of Angmar. He refuses to do so and Skorgrím orders the Dwarves to kill them. Underhill rushes to his aid. He manages to slay the Dwarves, but Skorgrím escapes. The Blackwold confesses that Éogan, their leader that took over after Skunkwold, wanted to join Angmar for riches. After Éogan's death, the rest of the Blackwolds agreed to have no part with Angmar and ally themselves with men from the South. The Dourhand Dwarves were not pleased and slayed the rest of his men. After finishing his tale, the last leader of the Blackwolds dies from his wounds.

===Chapter 4: Dark Designs===
Constable Underhill tells you to report what you heard and saw to [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] back at [[The Prancing Pony]]. He is thankful for the news, but his attention is turned towards the [[Nazgûl]]. They attempted to attack four Hobbits from [[the Shire]]. 

===Chapter 5: The Other Riders===
[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] says that there were only five [[Nazgûl]] that attempted to change Amdir and attacked the four Hobbits under his protection. The Nazgûl number nine which means there are still four hiding somewhere. He asks the player to speak to the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] [[Lenglinn]]. Strider sent him to watch over [[Mr. Underhill]] in [[Buckland]]. Yet, that Hobbit is now in his care. Strider gives the player directions to Lenglinn's camp.

The player learns that the remaining four Nazgûl did ride into Buckland on black horses. The Ranger attempted to block their way but was gravely wounded.

===Chapter 6: In the Black Riders' Wake===
Lenglinn points out that ''[[crebain]]'' started to show up in the Black Riders' wake. He informs the player that they are the eye of the Enemy and are watching over both [[Buckland]] and [[the Shire]]. He requests the player to dispatch of them so that they cannot report back to their master.

===Chapter 7: Horn-call of Buckland===
With the ''[[crebain]]'' problem solved, Lenglinn and the player are able to speak. He states he doesn't know [[Mr. Underhill]] but was told by [[Aragorn]] to watch over a Mr. Baggins. He is relieved to hear that he is now safe with Aragorn. He asks the player to go to [[Crickhollow]] and discover if the [[Nazgûl]] learned of anything.

At Crickhollow, the player finds a Hobbit named [[Fredegar Bolger]]. Fredegar says that Black Riders did come into Baggins' home while he was inside, but he managed to slip out back. He continues that he reported to the [[Shirriffs]] that Frodo left for the [[Old Forest]] before they showed up. He also states that he made no mention of the Enemy's Ring. Just when he noticed his mistake telling the player about the Ring some ''crebain'' fly out and attack the Hobbit. The player is able to defend him, but two manage to escape and head off to the Old Forest.

The player returns to Lenglinn to report that Frodo was not captured. The player also asks about a Ring that belongs to the Enemy. Leglinn does not answer, but is greatly concerned to hear that two ''crebain'' managed to hear about the Ring and escape. He asks you to report what happened to Aragorn in [[Bree]] at the [[Prancing Pony]].

Aragorn is distressed to hear the news and elects to head out of Bree with the four Hobbits with haste.

===Chapter 8: Master of the Wood===
[[Aragorn]] tells the player to search for [[Tom Bombadil]] in the [[Old Forest]] near [[Withywindle]]. Aragorn hopes that he will help you search for the ''[[crebain]]'' that overheard the Hobbit's words if you mention that he sent the player.

===Chapter 9: Lilies for the River-daughter===
[[Tom Bombadil]] agreed that he would help find the missing ''[[crebain]]''. Yet, only after the player helped him with the important task of picking water lilies for the [[River-daughter]]. He informed the player that there are some growing not far from [[Old Man Willow]].

===Chapter 10: Into the Barrow-downs===
Once the water lilies are collected [[Tom Bombadil]] informs you that the ''[[crebain]]'' are in the [[Barrow-downs]] with a lady named [[Andraste]]. He tells the player to follow the Old Barrows Road to reach them. 

The player defeats both the birds and their mistress Andraste. She reveals that the [[Witch-king|master of the Nine]] had gone off to [[Othrongroth]].

===Chapter 11: Othrongroth===
The player decides to spy on the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in [[Othrongroth]]. [[Tom Bombadil]] agrees to take you to the Great Barrow.

The player spies the Witch-king and [[Skorgrím]] as they enter into the barrow and the player enters inside without the aid of Tom. After fighting some [[Dourhands]] and [[Barrow-wights|wights]], the player listens in on the Witch-king talking to Skorgrím. The player learns that they came here to meet [[Ivar the Bloodhand|Ivar]] and then will travel to the north to meet up with [[Mordirith]]. The player learns no more as the Witch-king spots the player and summons more [[Barrow-wights|wights]] along with the Wight-lord [[Sambrog]] to deal with the player as they make haste to carry out their plans. 

The wight-lord informs the player that Skorgrím will go to the north to gather up a great army while the Witch-king will go to [[Agamaur]] to awaken a great power that lies in the waters. Before Sambrog can slay the player, Tom Bombadil suddenly appears and vanquishes the wight-lord. Tom skips out of Orthongroth as the player follows him.

===Chapter 12: The Black Rider's Designs===
The player returns to the [[Prancing Pony]] to inform [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] of all you have learned, but you find the room in was staying in locked. Speaking with [[Barliman Butterbur]] you learn that Strider left some time ago with [[Mr. Underhill]] and three other [[Hobbits]]. He also tells you that [[Gandalf]] is now staying at the inn and that Gandalf instructed him to have anyone looking for Strider to speak to him.
