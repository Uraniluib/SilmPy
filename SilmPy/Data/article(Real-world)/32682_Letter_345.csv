==Summary==
As a personal opinion Tolkien objected to giving animals strictly human and noble names.  [[Elrond]] and [[Glorfindel]] seemed unsuitable.  He had played with the word for “bull” that he had previously given her<ref group="note">See [[Letter 342]]</ref> in the form ''[[mundo|–mund]]'' and had come up with several names for bulls: [[Aramund]] ("Kingly bull"), Tarmund ("Noble bull"), Rasmund ("Horned bull"), and Turcomund ("Chief of bulls").

[[Arwen]] was not an elf but a half-elven who abandoned her elvish rights.  [[Galadriel]] is the chief elvish woman mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; her daughter was [[Celebrían]].  Another elven lady was [[Nimrodel]] but Tolkien did not want these names given to heifers or cows.  He suggested the name of [[Farmer Giles of Ham|Farmer Giles’]] favourite cow – Galathea.
