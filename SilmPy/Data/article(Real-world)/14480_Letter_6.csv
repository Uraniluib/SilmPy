==Summary==
[[Elizabeth Mary Wright|Mrs. Wright]] was the wife of [[Joseph Wright]], Tolkien's former philology Professor. Mrs Wright had sent Tolkien an offprint of an article by her husband about ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. Tolkien acknowledged its arrival with gratitude, and asked about her husband. He then told of his home situation: [[John Tolkien|John]] and [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] first and then his wife and nursemaid had been ill with measles for most of January. 

In a postscript he informed her that philology was making progress at the [[University of Leeds]].
