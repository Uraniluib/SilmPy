'''Meneldil''' ({{SA|3318}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|158}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> aged 281 years), the son of [[Anárion]] and grandson of [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] [[Elendil]], was the third [[King of Gondor]] and the first to rule in his own name. He reigned 156 years, from {{TA| 2}} until his death.  

==History==
===Early Life===
Meneldil was the last man born in [[Númenor]]<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> and was about one year old at the time of the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]].  He would have been carried to [[Middle-earth]] in his father’s ship where [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] established a new realm, [[Gondor]], under their joint leadership.

Meneldil was 111 years old when in {{SA|3429}} [[Sauron]] sent his army to attack and capture [[Minas Ithil]].  It is not known what role Meneldil may have played while his father defended [[Osgiliath]] and held the hosts of [[Mordor]] at bay.  With the arrival of Elendil and [[Gil-galad]]’s forces the fortunes of the [[War of the Last Alliance]] turned, but in the hard fighting Anárion died (in {{SA|3440}}), as did Elendil (in {{SA|3441}}).<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

===Succession to Kingship===
With the deaths of Elendil and Anárion, [[Arnor]] had no leader and the joint rule in [[Gondor]] was finished.  [[Isildur]] returned to Gondor, assumed the [[Elendilmir]] as Arnor’s king and proclaimed his [[High King of the Dúnedain|lordship]] over all the [[Dúnedain]], [[Dúnedain of the North|North]] and [[Dúnedain of the South|South]].  While most of Arnor’s forces returned to [[Eriador]] the new King remained in the South to restore order and define Gondor’s boundaries. With Meneldil and a company of trusted friends, Isildur rode about the boundaries of Gondor and in Anórien created the [[Tomb of Elendil]] upon the hill of [[Eilenaer]], thereafter called [[Amon Anwar]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

When he was ready he committed the rule of Gondor to Meneldil and departed for [[Rivendell|Imladris]] with his three oldest sons to consult with [[Elrond]].<ref name="Gladden"/> It is said that Meneldil was quite pleased to see his uncle and his sons leave for the North, hoping that they would remain there long.<ref>{{UT| Gladden}}, Note 10</ref>  Then, a month after their departure, Isildur and his three sons were slain in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].<ref name="Gladden"/>  Arnor would eventually (in {{TA|10}}<ref name="TA"/>) be ruled by Isildur’s fourth son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], but in the South Meneldil assumed full kingship, which was inherited by his descendants.  Gondor would not be ruled by an heir of Isildur until the ascension of [[Aragorn]].

Not much is known about his reign other than a Gondorian scholar wrote the ''[[Ondonóre Nómesseron Minaþurie]]''.<ref>{{VT|42}}, "[[The Rivers and Beacon-Hills of Gondor]]"</ref>

He was succeeded by his son [[Cemendur (King of Gondor)|Cemendur]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', in Section VII "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]", [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained that there were three manuscripts in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the information about the Southern Line of Gondor, and from its condition it appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Meneldil's date of birth was {{SA|3299}} instead of {{SA|3318}}. It was Isildur's son Kiryandil who was born in 3318 and thus was the last man born in Númenor.<ref name="Elendil"/>
