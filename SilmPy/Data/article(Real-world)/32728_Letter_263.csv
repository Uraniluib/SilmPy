}}{{letter|263}}
==Summary==
Tolkien criticized the block on page iii of ''Tree and Leaf'' as very distasteful and asked that it be reconsidered or omitted.  The lettering was ill-executed; and the fat, pollarded, unrooted, feeble-branched tree was nothing that Niggle could possibly have drawn.  If Tolkien's views and sentiments in the story were respected then he wished a more sympathetic design could be produced.
