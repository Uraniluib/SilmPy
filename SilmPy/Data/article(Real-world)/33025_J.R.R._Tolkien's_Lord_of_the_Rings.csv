'''''J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings''''' is a children's board game based on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It was designed by [[Reiner Knizia]], and the art work was made by Ingrid and Dieter Schubert.<ref>[http://www.sophisticated-games.com/sophisticated_web/lotrcomplete.html The Lord of the Rings] at [http://www.sophisticated-games.com/index.html Sophisticated Games] (accessed 30 April 2011)</ref>
==From the publisher==
Never before has an adaptation been made of Tolkien's great novel to make it appealing to younger children (6+). Reiner Knizia has succeeded completely in his masterful game for the whole family. There is a simple and a more advanced version of the game in the box, both playable on the same board and using most of the same pieces.

The art work by children's book illustrators Dieter and Ingrid Schubert is absolutely charming and just right for the age group.
