'''''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography''''' is a book by [[Humphrey Carpenter]]. Originally published in [[1977]], it is the official, authorized biography of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].
===From the Publisher===
The authorized biography of the creator of [[Middle-earth]]. In the decades since his death in September [[1973]], millions have read [[The Hobbit|THE HOBBIT]], [[The Lord of the Rings|THE LORD OF THE RINGS]], and [[The Silmarillion|THE SILMARILLION]] and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books.

Born in [[South Africa]] in January [[1892]], John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood and brought up in near-poverty. He served in the [[World War I|first World War]], surviving the [[Battle of the Somme]], where he lost many of the closest friends he'd ever had. After the war he returned to the academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] where he was a close friend of [[C.S. Lewis]] and the other writers known as [[Inklings|The Inklings]].

Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while grading essay papers he found himself writing 'In a hole in the ground there lived a [[Hobbits|hobbit]]' -- and worldwide renown awaited him.

[[Humphrey Carpenter]] was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien's papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE SILMARILLION and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century's most cherished author.

==Rejection of the first draft==

In a BBC interview with Martin Wainwright in 2003, Carpenter confirmed that Christopher Tolkien rejected the first draft of the biography believing it to be a very boring to read. Carpenter assumed that this was due to the number of letters quoted.<ref>{{webcite|author=|website=BBC|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0076g3d BBC Radio 4, Custodians of the World|accessed=13 September 2014}}</ref>
