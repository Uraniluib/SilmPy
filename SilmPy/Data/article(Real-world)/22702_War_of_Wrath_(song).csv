<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
"The field is lost 
Everything is lost 
The black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lie 
The enemy is within, everywhere 
And with him the light, soon they will be here 
Go now, my lord, while there is time 
There are places below" 

"And you know them too 
I release thee, go 
My servant you'll be for all time" 

"As you command, my king." 

"I had a part in everything 
Twice I destroyed the light and twice I failed 
I left ruin behind me when I returned 
But I also carried ruin with me 
She, the mistress of her own lust"
