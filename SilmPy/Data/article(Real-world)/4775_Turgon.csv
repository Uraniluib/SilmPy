}}'''Turgon''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtʊrɡɔn]}}) was an [[Elves|Elven]] king of the [[Noldor]], second son of [[Fingolfin]], brother to [[Fingon]], [[Aredhel]] and [[Argon]]. He was lord of the [[Gondolindrim|Elves of Nevrast]], and later of the hidden city of [[Gondolin]].

He is described as tall, wearing white with a gold belt and a crown of garnets, holding the [[Staff of Doom]] in his hand.  He was often called "''the Wise''".

==History==
[[File:Marya Filatova - Turukano and Elenwe.jpg|left|thumb|Marya Filatova - ''Turukáno and Elenwe'']]
Although Turgon was originally against the departure of the Ñoldor from [[Aman]], he eventually did set out on the journey. After [[Fëanor]] and his sons departed using the only ships, he took his people across the dangerous [[Helcaraxë]] with his father Fingolfin. He lost his wife [[Elenwë]] in the crossing and settled at [[Vinyamar]] in [[Nevrast]].

When he journeyed with his cousin [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] along [[Sirion]], [[Ulmo]] sent both of them a dream to look for a hidden place where they could be safe from the power of [[Morgoth]]. Then in the following year Ulmo appeared directly to Turgon and guided him to the vale of [[Tumladen]] in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Initially, Turgon left Tumladen and returned to Vinyamar, keeping his discovery a secret for many years. After the [[Dagor Aglareb]], Turgon began once again to feel the restlessness set in his heart by Ulmo, and his thought turned to Tumladen. He secretly moved many of the most skilled Ñoldor to the valley, and had them build [[Gondolin]]. When it was completed, he abandoned Vinyamar with his people and led them to Tumladen in secret, hidden by the power of Ulmo. Before leaving, however, and following Ulmo's prophecy, he left in Vinyamar a sword, mail and helm for one who would come in the hour of direst need of the Noldor and deliver hope. <ref>{{S|15}}</ref>

In Gondolin, Turgon ruled with the [[Staff of Doom]] in his right hand, and a coronet of garnets upon his head. At his side was [[Glamdring]]<ref>It was said in [[the Hobbit]] that it once belonged to the [[King of Gondolin]]</ref>.

Turgon and his people remained isolated in Gondolin for many years with his daughter [[Idril]], who married [[Tuor]] after the [[Men|man]] found the secret way and discovered the city.

Turgon reemerged with his host during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], and although the battle was still lost, his intervention prevented the rout from completely destroying the armies of the Ñoldor and their allies. He was killed at [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin's fall]], when his tower fell down over his head.
