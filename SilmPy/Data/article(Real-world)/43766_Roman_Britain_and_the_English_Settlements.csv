'''''Roman Britain and the English Settlements''''' is a book by R.G. Collingwood and J.N.L. Myres. In his Preface (dated [[14 January]] [[1936]]), Collingwood thanks his "colleague Professor  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]" for having helped him "untiringly with problems of [[Celtic]] philology" (p. vii). Tolkien is again explicitly mentioned in a footnote:<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]], [[Wayne G.

{{Blockquote|Let us look at the evidence. Sulis,<sup>1</sup> the goddess of the hot springs at Bath, came into her own at a very early date; her temple, with its classical architecture and very unclassical sculpture, was probably built in the Flavian period. But less than thirty miles away across the Severn, Nodens, the hunter-god of the Forest of Dean, who survived in later mythology as Nuada of the Silver Hand, king of the Tuatha dé Danann, and later still as King Lear, ''[…]''<br><sup>1</sup>. She is traditionally called Sul; but Professor Tolkien points out to me that the Celtic nominative can only be Sulis, and our authority for believing that even the Romans made a nominative Sul on the analogy of their own word ''sol'' — perhaps meaning the same — is not good. The Celtic ''sulis'' may mean ‘the eye’, and this again may mean the sun.|Chapter XVI, "Religion", p. 264}}
