'''''The Lord of the Rings''''' is a movie series consisting of three films. ''''' The Fellowship of  the Ring''''' , ''''' The Two Towers''''', and  '''''The Return of the King'''''. they are three live-action films which were directed by [[Peter Jackson]] and based upon the books by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Principal photography for all three films took place in [[New Zealand]] over a continuous eighteen-month period &mdash; the first time that three films had ever been shot together in this way, although some ''pairs'' of films had. There were several later "pick-up" shoots over the following months and years as the films were edited, special effects were added and the script was honed and revised. 

*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released in December 2001, and won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation of 2001.
*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' was released in December 2002.
*''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' was released in December 2003, and won all eleven of the Academy Awards for which it was nominated, including the award for Best Picture.
