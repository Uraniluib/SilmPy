}}This product was published with a different cover in 1984, and was later revised and combined with ''[[Southern Mirkwood|Southern Mirkwood]]'' (1983) and released as ''[[Mirkwood: The Wilds of Rhovanion]]'' (1988).

For use with this supplement, [[Mithril Miniatures]] released two sets of metal miniatures (M83 - M92 ''Mirkwood I'' and M103 - M112 ''Mirkwood II'').

== Cover/Jacket Text == 

This package details all of the Northern Wilderland.

''Northern MIRKWOOD'' contains: 

*6 major layouts 
*A 16" x 20" full-color double-sided detachable mapsheet, side #1 of which depicts settings from THE HOBBIT, side #2 maps out LAKE TOWN, DALE, and a Wood-elf village

Journey if you dare through the shadowy depths of Mirkwood, encounter Great Eagles, Giant Spiders, Bears, Wolves, and the Dragons of the Withered Heath. 
 
Follow the Old Forest Road through the heart of Mirkwood - take the path of Orome and the Elves of the First Age - and you'll find yourself in deep, dark woods once full of game and fish and berries. How strangely quiet the woods are now, how dreary and threatening since the Shadow of Mordor cast its pall across the land six hundred years ago. Only the Giant Spiders of the forest seem content as they lie in their shadowy lairs, alert for the slightest stir in their sticky, steely webs...
