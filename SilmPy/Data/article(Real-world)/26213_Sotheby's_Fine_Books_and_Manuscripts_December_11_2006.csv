'''''Sotheby's Fine Books and Manuscripts December 11 2006''''' is an auction catalogue from [[Sotheby's]] (New York), which includes a photograph and transcribed excerpts from a letter from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to [[Naomi Mitchison]] (see [[letter 122]]). The letter is erroneously said in the catalogue to have been written on 12 december 1949 (correct date is 18 December 1949).<ref>Cf. ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' and ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Chronology''. That the catalogue is in error was confirmed by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] in a private email to [[USER:Morgan]] on 1 May 2010.</ref>
