The '''1952 tape recording''' refers to a private [[Index:Audio recordings of J.R.R. Tolkien|audio recording]] by [[George Sayer]] of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in late August [[1952]].

Tolkien was visiting his friends (George Sayer and his wife) when the recording of Tolkien singing and reading excerpts from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the then unpublished manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was performed.<ref name=WH>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]]|articleurl=http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/tolkien-and-the-tape-recorder/|articlename=Tolkien and the Tape Recorder|dated=31 December 2013|website=[http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/ Too Many Books and Never Enough (weblog)]|accessed=8 January 2017}}</ref>

When issuing selections from the recording in 1975, [[Wikipedia:Caedmon Audio|Caedmon]] included the statement: "''Also included is a never-published poem, 'The Mirror of Galadriel,' originally intended for inclusion in the trilogy, yet edited out''". This note was a mistake, but has been reprinted on subsequent releases from Caedmon.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTolkienSociety.EducationalCharity/permalink/10154695982936068/|articlename=Tolkien Society Facebook group post|dated=|website=TS|accessed=8 January 2017}}</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Douglas A. Anderson]] have given the following account regarding the mistaken note:

{{blockquote|Sleeve notes by Ward Botsford and George Sayer. Botsford incorrectly identifies side B, band 16 as an unpublished poem for LR, book 2, ch.7... in fact the verse ([[Gandalf's Song of Lórien|In Dwimordene, in Lorien...]]) was published in LR, bk.3, ch.6|<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] (with the assistance of [[Douglas A. Anderson]]), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', p. 384</ref>}}

According to [[George Sayer]], selections which were not issued include Tolkien reading the Lord's Prayer in [[Gothic]] (and perhaps also in English): he had never seen a tape recorded before "''and said whimsically that he ought to cast out any devil that might be in it by recording a prayer, the Lord’s Prayer in Gothic''". Caedmon also cut out "''conversation which occurred in between his readings from his works''". It is unknown if the original tapes are still extant.<ref name=WH/>
