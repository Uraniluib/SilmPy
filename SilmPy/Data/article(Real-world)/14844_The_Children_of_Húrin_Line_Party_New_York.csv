==EVENT CANCELLED==
Unfortunately due to personal scheduling issues, work related, and other related organizing logistical issues we will not be on hand and able to hold the line party as planned. As it stands only one of us (either Anthony or Jessica) will possibly be able to attend the bookselling, and that is just to grab a few copies and run. We apologize to everyone who has signed up and supported our event, we will be holding a dinner and mythopoeic discussion group at Frodo's Restaurant soon, stay tuned for those details.
