==Summary==
Prefaced with "''Fæder his þriddan suna''<ref group="note">Anglo-Saxon, "[The] father [to] his third son."</ref> (1)", Tolkien felt it had been a long time (actually 8 days) since he had written.  Tolkien and his wife did not know when Christopher had left or to where.<ref group="note">He had gone to South Africa for pilot training.</ref>

Tolkien related local news, of which the most personally memorable was a stay in an air raid warden room.  Tolkien's companion was Cecil Roth<ref group="note">The reader in Jewish studies at Oxford.</ref> whom he found full of charm and gentleness.  Roth had woken up Tolkien at 10 to 7:00 so that he could go to Communion, which felt like a fleeting glimpse of an unfallen world.  Tolkien had considered not going but one sombre glance by this gentle Jew at his rosary settled the matter.  He had been colloguing with brothers [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams|C. Williams]].  Tolkien mentioned that the ''fouls''<ref group="note">The Tolkiens were keeping hens and this was a pun on "fowls".</ref> refused to lay but he still had to clean their den.

Referring to the number one at the beginning of his letter, Tolkien explained that he would now number each letter and each page so that Christopher would know if anything went awry.
