He wrote numerous books and articles in English and Icelandic on literature and religious history. Sisam began lecturing on Old and Middle English while still a student at Oxford. Tolkien, considered himself fortunate to have attended Sisam's lectures and later contributed a glossary to the work for which Sisam was best known, Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose. Sisam was assistant Secretary and Secretary to the Delegates of Oxford University Press. One page. Signed by Tolkien in black ink. Two punched filing holes.
