'''The Diaries of J.R.R. Tolkien''' refers to the [[:Category:Unpublished material|unpublished]] diaries of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The manuscripts are part of the Tolkien Papers at the [[Bodleian Library]], a collection which is only open to researchers working under the auspices of the [[Tolkien Estate]].<ref name=Interview>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/Wayne_Hammond_Christina_Scull_Interview.php Interview with Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull], at [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com Tolkienlibrary.com], as of 20 September 2010</ref>

[[Humphrey Carpenter]] was given access to the writings and quoted several passages in his work ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', noting that Tolkien used the diaries "''chiefly as a record of sorrow and distress, and when ... his gloom dissipated he ceased to keep up the diary entries''".<ref name=Biography>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''</ref> Permission to research the diaries was also granted to [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] for their preparation of ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'' (a work which also includes several quotes from the diaries).<ref name=Interview/>

*'''[[1926]]:''' [Carpenter notes that Tolkien wrote "''his diary from 1926 to 1933''" in the alphabet 'Quenyatic'/'Feanorian']<ref name=Biography/>

*'''1926:''' [As part of a summary of events of 1925, Tolkien writes:] "''The Tale of '[[Roverandom]]', written to amuse [[John Tolkien|John]] (and myself as it grew) got done''."<ref>{{HM|R}}, "Introduction", p. x</ref>

*'''?1920s-1930s:''' [On [[C.S. Lewis]]]: "''Friendship with Lewis compensates for much, and besides giving constant pleasure and comfort has done me much good from the contact with a man at once honest, brave, intellectual - a scholar, a poet, and a philosopher - and a lover, at least after a long pilgrimage, of Our Lord.''"<ref name=Biography/>

*'''?1930s:''' [On [[Christopher Tolkien]]:] "''a nervy, irritable, cross-grained, self-tormenting, cheeky person. Yet there is something intensely lovable about him, to me at any rate, from the very similarity between us''"<ref name=Biography/>

*'''[[1933]]:''' [On the occasion of driving his family to visit relatives in Birmingham:] "''I pass over the pangs to me of passing through Hall Green - become a huge tram-ridden meaningless suburb, where I actually lost my way - and eventually down what is left of beloved lanes of childhood, and past the very gate of our cottage, now in the midst of a sea of new red-brick. The old mill still stands, and Mrs Hunt's still sticks out into the road as it turns uphill; but the crossing beyond the now fenced-in pool, where the bluebell lane ran down into the mill lane, is now a dangerous crossing alive with motors and red lights. The White Ogre's house (which the children were excited to see) is become a petrol station, and most of Short Avenue and the elms between it and the crossing have gone. How I envy those whose precious early scenery has not been exposed to such violent and peculiarly hideous change.''"<ref name=Biography/>

*'''August [[1955]]''': [Notes on his visit to Italy with [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]]:] : "''Venice seemed incredibly, elvishly lovely''"<ref name=Biography/>; "''contrary to legend and my belief, Italians ... dislike exaggeration, superlatives, and adjectives of excessive praise. But they seem to answer to colour and poetic expression, if justified.''"<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', p. 469</ref>

*'''Late [[1963]] or early [[1964]]:''' [Carpenter notes that soon after [[C.S. Lewis]]'s death, Tolkien "''began to keep a diary, which was something he had not done for many years. In part it was an excuse for using another alphabet that he had invented; he called it his '[[New English Alphabet]]'.'']: "''Life is grey and grim. I can get nothing done, between stateness and boredom (confined to quarters), and anxiety and distraction. What am I going to do? Be sucked down into residence in a hotel or old-people's home or club, without books or contacts or talk with men? God help me!''"<ref name=Biography/>

*'''[[1968]]-[[1971]]:''' [Carpenter notes that Tolkien kept a diary "''for a brief time during [the] Bournemouth years''".]<ref name=Biography/>
