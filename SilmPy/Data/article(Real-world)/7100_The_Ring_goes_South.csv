'''The Ring goes South''' is the third chapter of the second book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
After the council meeting, the [[Hobbits]] held a meeting of their own. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were offended that [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] had been chosen to accompany [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and not them. [[Gandalf]] told them that scouts had been sent out to gather information about the Black Riders and that Frodo could not leave unless they come back with news. [[Gandalf]] told Frodo that he might accompany him, but for now Frodo had to remain at [[Rivendell]] and help [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] with a book of records he was completing.

The Hobbits remained at Rivendell for two months, by which time the scouts began to return. No news was to be had of the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], from any direction, except a few lost horses and torn cloaks. It was decided that Frodo must leave at once, accompanied by Sam and Gandalf. [[Elrond]] also decided that they should increase their numbers to nine, in order to match the Black Riders. [[Legolas]] would represent the [[Elves]]; [[Gimli]], son of [[Glóin]], would represent [[Dwarves]] and [[Aragorn]] ([[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]) would represent [[Men]]. Since Aragorn's path to [[Minas Tirith]] would lead with them, [[Boromir]] would also go along. Reluctantly, Pippin and Merry were allowed to go.

Aragorn's broken sword was re-forged and named [[Andúril]], the Flame of the West. Bilbo gave Frodo a small knife, named [[Sting]], and a shirt of ''mithril'' armour to be worn under his clothes. Each traveller brought their personal weapon and Sam took the pony [[Bill the Pony|Bill]]. They set out with the understanding that, except for Frodo, each was free to leave the party whenever he chose.

They reached the ruins in [[Eregion|Hollin]] and the first stage of their journey was complete. Strider felt like they were being observed by someone and noticed black ''crebain'' out of [[Dunland]] and [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] flying low over the land. The group decided to leave, and at one point even saw a dark shadow pass over the land.

Later, the Company reached [[Caradhras]], one of the three Mountains of [[Moria]]. They attempted to reach the [[Redhorn Gate]] and thus descend the mountain near [[Mirrormere]]. The snow was very deep at the Pass, however, and soon their escape was barred by a large drift. [[Aragorn]] and [[Boromir]] forced a path through it and carried the Hobbits back to safety while the rest walked or rode Bill the pony through their path.
