'''The Lord of the Rings Fan Club''' was an official club of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]. [[Decipher]] ran the club which consisted of 6 magazine issues a year for 3 years, forums, and a store. Unfortunately Decipher had neglected their Lord of the Rings fans as the films drew to a close, they stopped production of the magazines, let their domain expire so an adult company could pick it up, and have neglected their store and forums as well. Luckily the community has stood strong and started new sites.
