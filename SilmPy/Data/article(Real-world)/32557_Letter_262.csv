==Summary==
Pantheon Books asked Tolkien to write a preface for a new edition of [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''.  Tolkien replied that he would like to do as they asked, stating that while not as warm an admirer of MacDonald as [[C.S. Lewis]] was, he did think well of this story and had mentioned it in ''[[On Fairy-stories]]''.  Tolkien was not confident of producing something worthy of the honorarium offered, not being attracted to anything allegorical, mystical or moral.  He said he would do his best if there was time, and thanked them for their consideration.<ref group="note">Tolkien never wrote the preface for ''The Golden Key'', but he did make a start and in that start began composing ''Smith of Wootton Major''.</ref>
