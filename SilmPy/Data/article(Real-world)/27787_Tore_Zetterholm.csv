'''Tore Zetterholm''' ([[4 October|October 4]], [[1915]] - [[9 November|November 9]], [[2001]]) was a Swedish writer (author of 28 novels), literature historian, journalist, and translator.<ref>[http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tore_Zetterholm Tore Zetterholm, Swedish Wikipedia] (accessed 17 July 17 2010)</ref>

In [[1947]], Zetterholm published his translation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (the first translation of any of Tolkien's works to any language), calling it ''[[Hompen]]''.<ref name=Bere/>

Perhaps by a strange chance, Zetterholm was one of the recipients of the prestigious annual prize of literature given by ''[[wikipedia:Svenska Dagbladet|Svenska Dagbladet]]'' in 1950, when [[Britt G. Hallqvist]], a later translator of ''The Hobbit'', received the children's literature prize in the same year by the same newspaper.<ref name=Bere>[[Anders Stenström]], "[http://tolkiensarda.se/new/nummer/magsidor/art26_1.php Tolkien i svensk översättning: Från ''Hompen'' till ''Ringarnas herre'']" [English title: "Tolkien in Swedish translation: From ''Hompen'' to ''Ringarnas herre''"] (accessed 17 July 2010)</ref>
