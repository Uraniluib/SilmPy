==Tolkien and ''Beowulf''==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was a prominent ''Beowulf'' scholar; his ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' was a turning point in the modern study of the poem, moving the focus from its historical to its literary significance.<ref>Heaney, Seamus (2000). ''Beowulf'', "Introduction". New York: W.W. Norton. pp. ix&ndash;xxx.</ref> Tolkien also left two substantial unpublished manuscripts concerning ''Beowulf''. The first, a more substantial version of the previously mentioned critical essay, was edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]] and published as ''[[Beowulf and the Critics]]''.<ref>Michael D.C. Drout, [http://acunix.wheatonma.edu/mdrout/BandC/BandC.html Beowulf and the Critics].</ref> The second is a partial poetic and full prose translation of the epic, including commentary.<ref>[http://www.beowulftranslations.net/tolk.shtml Beowulf: Translations by J. R. R. Tolkien]. Updated 2003-01-05. Retrieved 2010-08-14.</ref> The latter was a minor media sensation on its 'discovery' in 2003 and was also to be prepared for publication by Drout, but as of 2010 this was not forthcoming.<ref>Michael D.C. Drout,  [http://wormtalk.blogspot.com/2007/10/beowulf-basics-ive-been-fielding-lot-of.html Wormtalk and Slugspeak: Beowulf Basics]. Updated 2007-10-10. Retrieved 2010-08-13.</ref> 

On 22 May 2014, HarperCollins published 
[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]], taken from the unpublished manuscript kept at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]].<ref>[[Rhona Beare]], "A Mythology for England", in ''[[The Silmarillion: Thirty Years On]]'' (ed. Allan Turner)</ref>

An excerpt from ''Beowulf'', rendered by Tolkien in [[Valmaric script]], was published with commentary in [[Parma Eldalamberon 14|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 14]].<ref>{{PE|14}}, pp. 90, 120, 122</ref> A similar excerpt from ''Beowulf'', rendered by Tolkien in his [[Qenya Alphabet]], was published with commentary in [[Parma Eldalamberon 20|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 20]].<ref>{{PE|20}}, pp. 67, 70</ref>

==Influence on the legendarium==

Tolkien looked highly upon ''Beowulf'', and it both indirectly and directly influenced his own [[Legendarium|imaginative work]]. The episode in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' where Bilbo steals a cup from [[Smaug]]'s horde, for example, is a conscious homage to a similar theft in ''Beowulf''.<ref>{{L|25}}.</ref>
