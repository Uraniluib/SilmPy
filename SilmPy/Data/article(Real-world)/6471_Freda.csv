'''Freda''' is a character invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. She and her older brother [[Éothain (film character)|Éothain]] were sent by their mother [[Morwen (film character)|Morwen]] to alert [[Théoden|King Théoden]] that the [[Dunlendings|Wild Men]] were pillaging through [[Rohan]]. Éothain and Freda were kept safe at [[Edoras]] until Théoden led his people to [[Helm's Deep]], where they were reunited with their mother.
