'''Lieutenant Geoffrey Bache Smith''' ([[18 October|October 18]]th, [[1894]] - [[3 December|December 3]]rd, [[1916]]) was a friend of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Tolkien and Smith attended [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] together. Smith would also become one of the core members of the [[T.C.B.S.]], but not until after [[Vincent Trought]]'s death. He was at that time already enrolled at Corpus Christi College, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], close to Tolkien's Exeter College. The two became close friends there, because most other Edwardians went to Cambridge.

Smith joined the 19th Service Battalion of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Fusiliers Lancashire Fusilliers], the "3rd Salford Pals", and participated in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He was hit by shrapnel on [[29 November|November 29]], 1916, and died four days later.

In [[1918]], a collection of poetry by Smith, titled ''[[A Spring Harvest]]'', was published. Tolkien wrote the preface.

==Quote==

“My chief consolation is that if I am scuppered tonight there will still be left a member [of our School group] to voice what I dreamed and what we all agreed upon. For the death of one of its members cannot, I am determined, dissolve [the group]. Death can make us loathsome and helpless as individuals, but it cannot put an end to the immortal four! May God bless you my dear John Ronald and may you say things I have tried to say long after I am not there to say them if such be my lot".{{fact}}
