The Prophecy I

Yénillor morne
tulinte i quettar
Tercáno Nuruva.

Hlasta! Quetis
Ilfirimain

'Out of the Black Years
come the words
[the] Herald of Death.

Listen! It speaks
to those who were not born to die...'

---

The Prophecy II

Hlasta!
Quetis Ilfirimain:

Corma turien te
Corma tuvien
Corma tultien te
Huinesse nutien.

Tercáno Nuruva.
Tuvien Corma tultien te
Huinesse nutien
Corma turien te Corma.

'Listen!

It speaks to those who were not born to die:

[One] Ring to rule them [all]
[One] Ring to find [them]
[One] Ring to bring them [all]
[And] in the Darkness bind it

[The] Herald of Death
to find [One] Ring, to bring them [all]
[And] in the Darkness bind it

[One] Ring to rule them [all], [One] Ring'
