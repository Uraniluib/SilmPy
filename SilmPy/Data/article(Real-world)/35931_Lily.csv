{{disambig-more|Lily|[[Lily (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Lily''' was one of the children who attended the [[Feast of Good Children]] when [[Smith Smithson]] ate the [[Fay-star]] that had been put in the [[Great Cake]].  Long after he had retired, the [[Master Cook]] at that occasion, [[Nokes]], was trying to figure out who had swallowed the Fay-star and he remembered Lily, the Draper's daughter.  Nokes claimed that Lily had swallowed pins as a baby and came to no harm.  [[Alf]], who had been Nokes' apprentice at the time, said that Lily had only eaten the paste and the sugar, and gave the inside of her slice of the Cake to another boy.<ref>[[J.R.R.
