'''''Requiem for a Tower''''' is the name for the up-beat song present in a trailer for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. It is often associated with [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson's]] [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], but the track was neither composed for the films nor featured in them. It was the main theme for the [[2000]] film ''[[Wikipedia:Requiem for a Dream|Requiem for a Dream]]''. The piece of music is called ''[[Wikipedia:Lux Aeterna (Requiem for a Dream)|Lux Aeterna]]'' and was composed by [[Wikipedia:Clint Mansell|Clint Mansell]].

For the trailer the song was re-orchestrated by ''[[The Ant Farm]]'' with three composers (Simone Benyacar, Dan Nielsen and Veigar Mairgersson), forty musicians and twenty choral voices.

A variation of the song would later be used in ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'', accompanying a fight sequence.
