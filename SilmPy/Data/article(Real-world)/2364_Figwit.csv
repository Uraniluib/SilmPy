'''Figwit''' (also known as '''Aegnor''' and '''Elf Escort''') is the fan-derived name for an [[Elves|Elf]] extra in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film version of ''The Lord of the Rings'']]. He soared into a popularity far exceeding his place in the movies when he was perceived as an extremely beautiful character by female fans - and some slash writers. He is played by [[Bret McKenzie]], who also portrayed [[Lindir]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.

==Role==
Figwit is seen in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|the first movie]] during the Council of Elrond. He sits next to [[Aragorn]] until they all stand up to argue. After Frodo shouts "I will take it!" and everyone turns and looks at him, Figwit is standing on the far right. He is standing in the background for only a fraction of a second; a main part of the joke is that the actor is just a minor extra.  

Figwit returns in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|the third movie]] in the scene where [[Arwen]] is leaving for the [[Grey Havens]] and has the vision about her future son [[Eldarion]]. Figwit is the one that tells her to get back with the others. His exact words: "Lady Arwen, we cannot delay!" and then "My lady!".

==Fandom==
Figwit's rise to fame began shortly after the first movie, and some fans believe he was given dialog in the third movie because [[Peter Jackson]] was aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of the ''Return of the King'']]: "the decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them."

===Figwit's "brother"===
Figwit has a lesser known "brother", played by extra Blair Morton. "Meorof", ''Mystery Elf On (the) Right Of Figwit'', appears, well, to Figwit's right in the Council of Elrond[http://www.theargonath.cc/characters/meorof/meorof.html].

==Alternate names==
The name '''Figwit''' is a humorous acronym by fans, and stands for "[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] is great - who is THAT?!?". 

However the name has also appeared in official material of the movie franchise: once on an autograph card, and once on a card for [[Arwen]]; both these cards are by [[Topps]]. 

In the credits of ''The Return of the King'', he is called '''Elf Escort''', and his [[Decipher Card]] gives the name '''[[Aegnor]]''', a name derived from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. 

In fanfiction, Figwit is sometimes called '''Melpomaen''', a shoddy translation of the elements "fig" (''melpo'' in [[Qenya]]) and "wit" (''maen'' in [[Noldorin]])<ref>[http://www.figwitlives.net/faq.htm# FigwitLives' FAQ]</ref>.

Bret McKenzie's character in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' is '''[[Lindir]]''', who shares similarities with Figwit. Both are dark-haired Elves of [[Rivendell]] and courtiers of [[Elrond]]. It is unclear if the two characters are intended to be the same, which would establish a "canon" name for Figwit.

==Other media==
In 2004 a 50 minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon, [http://www.enzedff.co.nz/filmsynopsis.asp?FilmID=1802&Archive=0&RegionID=1&EventID=8 "Frodo is great... Who is that?!!"], was made by three [[Wellington]] filmmakers Stan Alley, Nick Booth and Hannah Clarke - all of whom worked on ''Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings''. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to Edinburgh where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and "elvish good looks" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as [[Peter Jackson]], [[Barry Osbourne]], [[Mark Ordesky]], [[Ian McKellen]] and other cast members.
