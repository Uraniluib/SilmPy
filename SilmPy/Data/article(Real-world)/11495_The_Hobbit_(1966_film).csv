'''''The Hobbit''''', presented as '''''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit''''', was the first film adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', created by [[Gene Deitch]] in 1966. The film was produced by [[William Snyder]] and took less than a month to create. The film was approximately 12 minutes long and was only created so Snyder could extend his license for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and sell it back to Tolkien and his publishers, which he did for $100,000.<ref name="Deitch"/>

== Plot ==
[[Smaug|Slag the Monster Lizard, Agent of Evil on Earth]] ransacked the city of Golden Bells, [[Dale]], taking all of their treasures for himself, including the precious [[Arkenstone]] of Old. Only General [[Thorin|Torin Oakenshield]], [[Mika Milovana|Princess Mika]] and a lone, unnamed watchman (who had been asleep when Slag attacked) survived. Desperate, they turned to the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] in his lonely tower. He pointed them to a prophecy of the Dragon's death in The Great Book, for which they needed a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]. The whole party went to the house of [[Bilbo Baggins]], who initially refused the task requested of him, but after some persuasion from Gandalf and the princess, joined the three on their quest.

Soon, they encountered two "[[Trolls|Groans]]", monstrous creatures that turned to trees when exposed to sunlight. Bilbo's companions were captured, but Bilbo tricked the two into a fight until the sun rose. They continued their journey, and General Oakenshield and the Princess started to appreciate their burglar. But suddenly, Bilbo disappeared. He had fallen though a crevasse in the mountain, and fell past the evil "[[Orcs|Grablins]]" into the lake where "[[Gollum|Goloom]]" dwelt. He found Goloom's [[The One Ring|magic ring]], and dashed away through the tunnels. He hid behind a rock, and allowed Goloom to overtake him so he could find his way out. 

After traveling through [[Mirkwood]] Forest, Bilbo came to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. He stole the Arkenstone, crafted a bow from mining tools, and shot the Arkenstone through Slag's heart. Slag was killed, and Dale restored. Bilbo returned to Hobbiton with Princess Mika as his wife.
