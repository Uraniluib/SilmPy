==From the producers==

Relive the epic struggle of good versus evil in Middle-earth with ''The Hobbit Card Game'', Martin Wallace's fast-paced, standalone, trick-taking card game for 2-5 players. Win hands and use the cards you've won to deal damage to opponents, or heal allies and help them with extra cards. Each character assigns cards differently, so use your skills wisely! Fight the forces of evil as Gandalf, Thorin, or Bilbo, or smash the hopes of the heroes as Smaug or Bolg, the goblin leader.<ref name=FF/>
