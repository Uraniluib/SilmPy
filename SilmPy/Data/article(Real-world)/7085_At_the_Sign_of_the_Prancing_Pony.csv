'''At the Sign of the Prancing Pony''' is the ninth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
[[Tom Bombadil]] escorted the [[Hobbits]] to the town of [[Bree]], the chief village of [[Bree-land]], a small inhabited region. Both Hobbits and "[[Men|big people]]" lived in Bree. They were the original descendants of the first men that ever wandered into the west of [[Middle-earth]]. In the wild lands beyond Bree, mysterious wanderers called [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] roamed the lands as far as the [[Misty Mountains|misty mountains]]. The Rangers had special powers.

When the Hobbits reached Bree they went to [[the Prancing Pony]], an inn recommended by Tom. The innkeeper was [[Barliman Butterbur]]. A ranger, a man named [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]], was also in the Prancing Pony. During the revelry in the Inn, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] accidentally put on the [[The One Ring|ring]] and his sudden invisibility shocked everyone around.

When he reappeared, he tried to explain away his sudden disappearance, but Strider approached him, saying that he needed to talk to Frodo. The innkeeper, told Frodo not to cause any more trouble; he also told Frodo that he would come up to his room because he had something of interest to say to him. Frodo suspected the innkeeper and Strider, as he had become increasingly paranoid of discovery.
