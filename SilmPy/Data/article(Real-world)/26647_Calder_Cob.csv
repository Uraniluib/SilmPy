'''Calder Cob''' is a character created specifically for [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]. 

Calder is a citizen of [[Archet]] and a traitor. He aligns himself with the [[Blackwolds]] and gives them information on their defenses. His plans are found out by [[Jon Brackenbrook]], but Jon is unable to convince [[Captain Brackenbrook|his father]], the Captain of Archet, because it was Calder who imprisoned [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Otto the Brigand|Otto]], the former leader of the brigands that attacked Archet. Dirk Mudbrick, with aid of the player, can finally convince Captain Brackenbrook that Calder is a traitor, but it is already too late.  <ref name="SOA">{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>
