== Cover/Jacket Text == 

This supplement draws adventurers into the mysterious Suza Sumar, a rainforest thriving in desert sands. The Honnin, a hidden people related to the Woses of the Ered Nimrais, dwell between the boles of the great trees, harvesting the forest's bounties and zealously guarding their secrecy. Despite their caution, the Dark Lord's schemes soon may boil out of the Forest of Tears to overrun all of Far Harad. 

Explore the sunspeckled twilight beneath the boughs of the Forest of Tears. Amidst the songs of brilliantly feathered birds, a small people struggles with its insane gods, fighting to keep the traditions of its age-old society intact. Obsessed with secrecy, the Honnin are troubled by a cannibalistic spirit who preys on its worshippers and a Tavari seduced by Sauron's promises of power. These dangers threaten visitors to the mysterious Forest of Tears. 

FOREST OF TEARS contains: 

*TWO FULL-COLOR MAPS: including a regional map and a map of the nearby city of Bozisha-Dar. 
*THREE EXCITING ADVENTURES: confront an order of the Honnin Monks intent on guarding the secrecy of "The Hidden Shrine"; avenge the death of a Haradan youth in "The Tower of Birds"; and combat a local goddess pledged to Sauron's service in "The City of Pred". 
*DETAILED LAYOUTS: of all adventure sites. 
*STATISTICS: for Honnin priests and monks, beasts of the Suza Sumar, and one of the powerful Tavari.
