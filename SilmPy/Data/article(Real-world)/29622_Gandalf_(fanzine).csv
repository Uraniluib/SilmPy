'''''Gandalf: Tidsskrift for fantasi''''' was a Norwegian fanzine (calling itself a "tidsskrift",  ("journal")), edited by Øyvind Myhre and published during the 1970s. Although the title was taken from [[Gandalf|a character]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the fanzine covered fantasy literature in general and also included short novels. A few issues had articles about, or relating to, Tolkien (see below).

The fanzine format was of stapled, type-printed A4 paper, and each issue of the magazine featured a hand-drawn illustration on the cover.
