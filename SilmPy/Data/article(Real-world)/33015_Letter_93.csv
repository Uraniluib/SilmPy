==Summary==
Tolkien was happy that [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] had enjoyed the next three chapters of the [[The Lord of the Rings|Ring]] and told him new consignments should reach him about 10 December and 14 January.  He said that [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] was the most closely drawn character, the successor to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and the genuine hobbit.  [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] was less interesting because he had to be highminded.  The book would probably end with Sam since Frodo would be too ennobled and rarefied by the Quest and would pass into the West with all the great figures.  Sam would settle down to [[The Shire|the Shire]].  [[Charles Williams|C. Williams]] said the great thing is the centre is not in strife and war and heroism but in freedom, peace, ordinary life and good liking.  Yet he agreed that these very things required the existence of a great world outside of the Shire.

Christopher had written ''Harebell'' and emended it to ''Hairbell''.  Tolkien had once looked up the names after arguing with a dogmatic scientist.  The ancient name was ''harebell'', and refers to the ''hyacinth'', not the ''campanula''.  ''Hairbell'' was a fictitious alteration made by meddlesome book-botanists, and Tolkien then proceeded to discuss the origin of ''foxglove''.  Why these flowers had animal-associated names was unknown.  Perhaps, mused Tolkien, they depended on lost beast-fables and he thought it would be interesting to make some fables to fit the names.

Tolkien asked if Christopher was still naming nameless flowers that he found.  Tolkien said his best inventions were ''[[Elanor (flower)|elanor]]'' and ''[[Niphredil|nifredil]]'', although he liked the Anglo-Saxon ''[[Simbelmynë|symbelmynë]]''.  He thought he would invent some more for Sam's garden in the end.
