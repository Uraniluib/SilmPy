==From the Publisher==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is one of the most beloved and enigmatic writers of the twentieth century, yet surprisingly little is known about the personal life of the author of [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]. After a traumatic childhood, Tolkien experienced the bloody trenches of [[World War I]], then lived most of his life as an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] scholar in a cloistered academic community. In this fascinating illustrated biography, author Daniel Grotta examines how much of Tolkien's personal experience fired his incredible imagination and led to the creation of Middle-earth and its inhabitants. This edition features full-color illustrations by [[the Brothers Hildebrandt]], whose conceptions of [[Middle-earth]] and its denizens have brought Tolkien's life's work to vivid life for legions of fans around the world.
