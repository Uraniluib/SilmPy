'''''Fifty New Poems for Children: An Anthology Selected from Books Recently Published by Basil Blackwell''''' is a book which includes [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s poem "[[Goblin Feet]]" (erroneously attributed to "J.R.R. [[Tolkein]]"), which had previously been published in ''[[Oxford Poetry|Oxford Poetry 1915]]''. It also contains the poem "Romance" by E. F. A. Geachh, which [[Douglas A. Anderson]] has suggested could have inspired "[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]" in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name="AH">{{HM|AH}}, p. 360</ref>
