== Summary ==
This letter was a reply to a letter from C. A. Furth of [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] informing Tolkien that "one of the outstanding firms of American publishers" had expressed an interest ''[[The Hobbit]]''. That firm suggested hiring "good American artists" to supply further colour illustrations, but Allen & Unwin would prefer they were done by Tolkien himself.

Tolkien asked the name of the American publishers and enquired about financial arrangements. Regarding the additional illustrations he agreed he ought to draw them, feeling professional pictures would look out of place next to his own "amateurish productions". However since it was the middle of term this will take some time, and he instructed Allen & Unwin to allow the American firm to produce their own illustrations rather than lose their interest through delay, with the proviso that it must be possible to "veto anything from or influenced by the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney studios]] (for all whose works I have a heartfelt loathing)".
