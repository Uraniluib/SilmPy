'''The Houses of Healing''' is the eighth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

==Summary==
Crying and in pain, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] accompanied the procession carrying [[Théoden]] and [[Éowyn]] into the [[Minas Tirith|city]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> As Merry ascended the city roads, he ran into [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], who was startled and glad, and noticed that Merry was stumbling badly. Merry's arm had gone completely numb after he stabbed the [[Nazgûl]]. Pippin escorted Merry to the [[Houses of Healing]].

After the battle, [[Aragorn]] furled his banner and ordered his men to prepare tents outside the city. He refused to claim his throne until the war with [[Mordor]] was decided, for good or ill. Aragorn planned to wait outside the gate until the [[Stewards of Gondor|Lord of Minas Tirith]] bade him to enter. Aragorn, learning of Denethor’s fate, assigned [[Imrahil]] to act as the interim leader of [[Gondor]]. Aragorn, [[Éomer]], and Imrahil secretly agreed, though, that [[Gandalf]] was their true leader for the remainder of the war against Mordor.

At Gandalf's request, Aragorn entered the city in the guise of a Ranger. The wounded, including Merry, [[Faramir]], and Éowyn, grew steadily sicker from the poison of the Enemy’s weapons. One of the city’s [[Ioreth|nurses]] recalled a legend of Gondor, which said, "The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known." Only Aragorn could save those wounded by the Enemy.

Aragorn crushed the leaves of an [[Athelas]] plant, a seemingly useless herb that grew in Gondor, and stirred them in a bowl of warm water. The sweet scent of the herb awoke Faramir from his fever. Faramir immediately affirmed Aragorn as his superior and king. Aragorn then tended to Éowyn and Merry, who both returned to consciousness when Aragorn touched and kissed them. All through the night, Aragorn healed the wounded of the city. Rumours flew throughout the city that the King of Gondor now walked again, bringing healing in his hands. As foretold at Aragorn's birth, the people called him [[Elfstone]],<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> or [[Aragorn|Elessar]], after the green gem that he wore around his neck, which [[Galadriel]] had given to him earlier.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>
