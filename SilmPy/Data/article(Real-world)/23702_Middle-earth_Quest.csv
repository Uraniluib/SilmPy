'''Middle-earth Quest''' (MEQ) was a series of solo adventure paperback books (similar to the ''[[Tolkien Quest]]'') based on the ''QuestGame'' System, published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]. According to [[Terry Kevin Amthor|Terry Amthor]], the books in the ''Middle-earth Quest'' series were scrutinized more closely than the supplements to ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]]'', involving [[Rayner Unwin]] and a "Tolkien scholar at Oxford"<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/terbob/terry/biblio.html ''Terry Kevin Amthor Bibliography''] (external link), as of May 9, 2010</ref>.
