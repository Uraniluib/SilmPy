==Summary==
Tolkien had received a royalty check sent by Furth on February 8th for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and he thanked him for it, calling it a tonic since he had the influenza.  Tolkien said that he would get his stuff (''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') typed and sent to him.  He planned to make a special effort to finish it before June 15th since Furth had said that they needed the new story no later than that time to publish it by Christmas.

Tolkien asked if the enlarged version of ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' had met with any sort of approval.  He asked if two more stories or any more stories of the [[Little Kingdom]] were desired, and mentioned some of the characters and a battle for a possible sequel to the story.
