American Academy Award-winning animator '''Gene Deitch''' (born [[1924]]) was the director and creator of the first animated film of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1966. The film was produced by [[Bill Snyder]] and was made in under a month. The running time for the film was a miniscule 12 minutes and was produced simply so Snyder could extend his license for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and sell it back to Tolkien and his publishers for $100,000.
