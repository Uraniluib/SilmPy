'''Farthingho''' was where at one time an outpost was maintained by the [[Little Kingdom]] of King [[Farmer Giles|Ã†gidius Draconarius]] against the [[Middle Kingdom]].  Actually there are only indications in the fragmentary legend of [[Georgius]] (the son of the king) and his page [[Suovetaurilius]] (also known as Suet) of this place.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Foreword</ref>
