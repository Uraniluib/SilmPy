'''Nell Smithson''' was the wife of [[Smith Smithson]], the title character of the story ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''.  She was one of the twenty-four children at the [[Feast of Good Children]] when young Smith was present and ate the [[Fay-star]].  Nell had been disappointed to find no lucky trinket in her slice of the [[Great Cake]] served at the Feast, but Smith gave her the silver coin he had found.

Nell became Smith's wife and together they had two children, [[Nan Smithson|Nan]] and [[Ned Smithson|Ned]].  She and the children knew about the star on Smith's forehead because they sometimes saw it shining upon his brow.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
