<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
To north, to north there lay the land of dread 
Dungorthin, where all ways were dead 
In hills, in hills of shadow bleak and cold 
Beyond was deadly nighshades hold 

To south, to south the wide earth unexplored 
To west, to west the ancient ocean roared 
To east, to east in peaks of blue were piled 
The mountains of the outer world 

Unsailed and shoreless, wide and wild 
To east in peaks of blue were piled 
In silence folded, mist enfurled 
The mountains of the outer world 

Beyond the tangled, woodland shade 
Thorn and thicket grove and glade 
Whose brooding boughs with magic hung 
Were ancient when the world was young
