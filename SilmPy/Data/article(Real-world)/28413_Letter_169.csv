==Summary==
[[Wikipedia:Hugh Brogan|Hugh Brogan]] discovered the word "Numinor" in [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[wikipedia:That Hideous Strength|That Hideous Strength]]'', and asked Tolkien about it. Tolkien answered that Lewis may have heard wrong, as the proper spelling was [[Númenor]] or [[Númenor|Númenóre]]. 

Brogan also asked about the shape of the world in the [[Third Age]]; Tolkien never really settled on the shape of his world, as it would affect his history telling.
