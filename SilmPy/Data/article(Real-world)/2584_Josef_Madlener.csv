'''Josef Madlener''' ([[16 April|April 16]], [[1881]]– [[27 December|December 27]], [[1967]]) was a German artist and poet.

==Biography==
Josef Madlener, born as a farmer's son in the Bavarian village Amending (today a district of [[wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memmingen|Memmingen]]), attended a School of Art and Applied arts. Later he studied at the [[wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Fine_Arts_Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Munich.

His pictures often show folksy or religious scenes. His style was impressionistic and in the same way symbolic, too. His works were published in several newspapers and magazines. He wrote some Christmas stories for children. Madlener's Christmas pictures were published in post card series, too.

Josef Madlener had one known daughter, named Julie Madlener ([[1910]]– [[1999]])<ref>[http://www.buchhandel.de/detailansicht.aspx?isbn=978-3-930323-69-2 	Biographical data in a brief description of ''Das goldene Buch''] (German)</ref>.

==Origin of Gandalf==
In [[1935]] the Bavarian fine art publisher F.A. Ackermann published a series of post cards under the title ''Sagen und Märchen'' (Legends and Fairy tales). The series contained six reproductions of folkloristic paintings: 
* ''Der Frühling Kommt'' (Spring is coming), 
* ''Die Bergfee'' (The Mountain-fairy), 
* ''[[wikipedia:Rübezahl|Rübezahl]]'', 
* ''Waldmärchen'' (Forest fairy tales), 
* ''[[wikipedia:Hubertus|Hubertushirsch]]'' (Saint Hubert's Hart)

and finally the reproduction of ''[[Der Berggeist]]'' (The Mountain-spirit), that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] likened to the character of [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|wizard]].

[[Humphrey Carpenter]] tells in his [[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography|Biography of the author]], that Tolkien kept this post card safe and later wrote 'Origin of Gandalf' on the card's envelope. 

Though Carpenter speculates, that Tolkien bought the post card already in his summer holidays [[1911]], when he was in Switzerland. This speculation is incorrect, because the post card version of ''Der Berggeist'' was published first in 1935. In an interview the daughter of the artist gives the painting's date of origin as the middle or end of the nineteen twenties.

The american magazine [[Mythlore]] published the article ''The Origin of Gandalf and Josef Madlener'' by [[Manfred Zimmermann]] in [[1983]].

The original painting came to America after World War II, where it was later rediscovered. In [[2005]] it was sold at Sotheby's for 84000 pounds.

Tolkien purchased at least one other Madlener postcard published by Ackermann's: [http://www.akpool.de/ansichtskarten/205063-kuenstler-ak-madlener-j-heilige-familie-esel-wald|"Heilige Familie"] (Holy Family), which he sent to [[Letter to Miss Kilbride|Katherine Kilbride on 24 December 1938]].
