At somepoint during the 1960s, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|two letters]] to [[Przemyslaw Mroczkowski]]'''.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?pos=7&intObjectID=5210972&sid= Christies.com], retrieved June 27, 2010. The lot description gives no details on the exact date of these letters. However, they are said to have been written later than [[Letter to Przemyslaw Mroczkowski (December 1959)]] and earlier than [[Letter to Mrs Mroczkowska (10 April 1969)]]. Likewise, we are neither told the number of these letters, but since the lot contains eight letters in total, we can conclude that two items remain.</ref>

*'''Publication:''' A description of the letters was included in ''[[Christie's Fine Printed Books and Manuscripts 1 June 2009]]''.
