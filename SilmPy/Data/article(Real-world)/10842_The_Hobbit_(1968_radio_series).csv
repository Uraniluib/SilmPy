{{cleanup}}{{disambig-more|The Hobbits|[[The Hobbit (disambiguation)]]}}
'''''The Hobbit''''' is a [[1968]] [[BBC|BBC Radio]] adaptation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Hobbit]].

The series was adapted by [[Michael Kilgariff]] and produced by [[John Powell]] in eight half-hour mono episodes for BBC Radio 4.

==Story==
The radio series follows the [[The Hobbit#synopsis|plot]] of the second edition very closely, except for the addition of The Tale Bearer, a narrator whose account of the story is often interrupted and embellished by the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] in the role of secondary narrator.

Bilbo, a stay-at-home [[Hobbits|hobbit]], is approached by the [[wizard]] [[Gandalf]] to undertake a dangerous adventure, and despite his initial reluctance he soon finds himself accompanying [[Thorin]] and his party of [[dwarves]] on a long and difficult quest to recover the dwarves' treasure from [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|dragon]], encountering [[trolls]], [[Orcs|goblins]], [[Gollum]] (acquiring a [[The One Ring|magic ring]] near Gollum's cave), [[wargs]], [[eagles]], giant [[spiders]], [[elves]] and [[men]] along the way. In the process Bilbo is transformed from a clumsy, timid and rather comic figure into a dignified and occasionally heroic everyman.

===Influences from ''The Lord of the Rings''===
Although the script is closely based on the original novel, Kilgariff incorporates a few names and phrases from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that did not originally appear in ''The Hobbit''.
*In an early scene at [[Bag End]], Gandalf originally tells Bilbo, "Great elephants, you're not at all yourself today". In the radio version this is changed to "Great [[oliphaunts]]", the form used in ''The Lord of the Rings''.
*After killing the Great Goblin, Gandalf makes a light by saying the spell ''Naur an edraith ammen''. 
*At the beginning of the [[Battle of Five Armies]] Gandalf says, "Upon victory depends not just the treasure, nor only our lives, but the whole future and well-being of [[Middle-earth]]". The name Middle-earth is not used at all in the original novel.
*During the battle the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] uses his name, Thranduil, as a battle-cry.
*In the same battle Thorin uses the dwarves' battle-cry, "[[Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!]]"

The music is composed  by [[David Cain]] and performed by David Munrow with The Early Music Consort.

==Production==
The show's production was complicated by the inclusion of multiple sound effects (often inserted live while recording the actors' performances), songs from the novel, and special sounds and electronic voice treatments created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. All of the trolls, elves, goblins, wargs and eagles have treated voices, as does Gandalf when imitating the trolls.

==Wiping and recovery==
The original master tapes for the series seem to have been wiped sometime during the 1970s. The reason is not clear, although it was rumoured to be due to a dispute with the Tolkien estate (if so, the subsequent recovery and commercial issue of the series proves that the dispute was resolved). 

The BBC eventually recovered the series from a domestic off-air FM recording, apparently comprising 90- and 60-minute compilations edited together from the original episodes. The sound quality of these recordings is clear and legible, though it is noticeably inferior to a studio-quality recording and exhibits prominent tape hiss.

For broadcast and home audio purposes the BBC re-edited these compilations back into half-hour episodes, adding a brief snatch of the theme tune at the beginning and end of each. The title ''The Hobbit'' is spoken only at the beginning of the first episode and there are no opening or closing credits. It is quite likely that the credits were never included in the episodes themselves, but would originally have been read by a continuity announcer at the end of each episode.

==Audio release and reference==
There have been several home audio releases of the series on cassette and CD. The [[1997]] CD release includes a bonus CD containing 9 minutes and 45 seconds of additional music in stereo, which evidently ''was'' taken from an unwiped master tape. The 1997 set also contains a "Personal Memoir" by series producer John Powell, from which some of the information in this article is derived.

On [[29 July|July 29]], [[2008]], an edition was published by BBC AudioBooks America; it includes interviews with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/835-Tolkien_Audio_Books_2008.php Tolkien Audiobooks 2008], [[Pieter Collier|TolkienLibrary.com]]</ref>
