==Summary==
In late March, Tolkien had attended a [["Hobbit Dinner" in Rotterdam|"Hobbit Dinner"]] organised by ''Voorhoeve en Dietrich'', a Rotterdam bookseller. Tolkien first recounts his arrival in Rotterdam, where he was met by C. Ouboter, the representative of ''Voorhoeve en Dietrich'', who waved a copy of ''The Lord of the Rings'' at the railway station. 

Ouboter was embarrassed about the menus that had been printed for the dinner: these included “maggot-soup”! It was, of course [[mushrooms|mushroom]] soup, named after [[Farmer Maggot]], not a soup of vermin. Tolkien met a representative of ''Het Spectrum'', the publisher of [[Max Schuchart]]’s Dutch translation, with whom he went to see Rotterdam, [[wikipedia:Rotterdam Blitz|ruined and half-rebuilt]]. Tolkien associated the Dutch people's love for Hobbits with this tragic event in Rotterdam: old, ancestral and natural buildings, [[The Scouring of the Shire|replaced by gigantic and largely dehumanised buildings]].

In the evening, he dined with 200 paying people. Both Tolkien and his Dutch friend professor Piet Harting were surprised about the attendance, and even more about the many that had been turned away. The dinner was long and abundant, and interwoven with speeches. He liked all but one of the speeches, by a psychologist. Tolkien himself also spoke, in a parody of [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo’s speech]]. 

The Rotterdam tobacco company Van Rossem had put up posters over-printed with [[pipe-weed]] names: ''Longbottom Leaf'', ''Old Toby'' and ''Southern Star''.  Later they sent Tolkien pipes and tobacco. Tolkien finished this fragment by thanking Rayner. [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] had paid for Tolkien’s journey. 

==Notes==
* ''Voorhoeve en Dietrich'' was a Rotterdam bookseller and printer, legendary in Rotterdam, but not existent anymore.
* The disagreeable speech was made, not by a psychologist, but by a graphologist.
