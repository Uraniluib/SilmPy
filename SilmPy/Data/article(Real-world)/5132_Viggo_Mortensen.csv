American actor '''Viggo Peter Mortensen, Jr.''' (born 1958) played [[Aragorn]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]. He was a last-minute replacement for [[Stuart Townsend]], as director [[Peter Jackson]] did not believe Townsend looked old enough to play the part convincingly. Mortensen was considering turning down the part, but his son, who loved the books, encouraged him to take the role. His son, Henry Mortenson, also appears as a child of Rohan in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]] and as a soldier extra in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]].

==Quotes==
{{quote|There were plenty of reasons not to go. I didn't feel I could do a good job and I didn't want to be away from my son for that length of time. But my son was familiar with the books, he talked about them with his school friends and he knew about the character of Aragorn. He said, 'Oh, that's pretty cool. You should try that.|Viggo Mortensen, Empire Magazine Australia}}
