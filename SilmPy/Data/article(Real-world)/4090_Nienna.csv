'''Nienna''' was a Queen of the [[Valar]], the sister of [[Mandos]] and [[Irmo]], acquainted with grief and sorrow but also pity and courage.

==Attributes==
The sister of the [[Fëanturi]], she is ranked as one of the eight [[Aratar]], the most powerful of the Valar. Her element is grief, ever mourning for the wounds of the world by evil. Those who listen to her learn wisdom and endurance in grief.<ref name=SIIb>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

Her [[Halls of Nienna|halls]] are in the distant west, close to the [[Halls of Mandos]], but on the western borders of the World and her windows look outward from the [[Walls of the World]]. She dwells alone and rarely travelled to the joyful city of [[Valmar]]; those in the [[Halls of Waiting]] who cried to her, and she went more often to the halls of her brother [[Mandos]] to comfort and counsel them.<ref name=SIIb/>

All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey hood.<ref name=S9>{{S|9}}: "cast back her grey hood"</ref>

==History==
Her part in the [[Music of the Ainur]] was one of deep sadness, and from this grief entered the world in its beginning.<ref name=SIIb/>

The [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Gandalf#Names|Olórin]], who was later to travel to [[Middle-earth]] as [[Gandalf]], learned much from her.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

Nienna played a part in the making of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]; she wept on the mound of [[Ezellohar]], watering it with her tears.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> After the destruction of the Trees by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], she once again wept on their wounded remains, cleansing the filth of [[Ungoliant]], and helping to bring forth the last fruit and flower that were to become the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]].<ref name=S9/>

The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he wrought in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his part.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Nienna'' is a [[Quenya]] name which contains the word ''nie'' "tear".<ref>{{LR|Etymolgoies}}, entry NEI</ref>
