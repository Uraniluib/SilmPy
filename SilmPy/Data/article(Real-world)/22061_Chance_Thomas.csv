==Quotes==
{{quote|I really began to understand just how much thought the old professor put into imagining how his world would resonate with music. This wasn’t a casual afterthought. He’d done some real thinking about music and sound in his world. I felt that if I was ever going to make any music that amounted to anything for this universe, I had better understand it from the ground up.|Chance Thomas, [http://www.vgmonline.net/chancethomasinterview/]}}
{{quote|I was given a mandate to create music that was true to the spirit and letter of Tolkien's writings. To do that with any sort of fidelity, I found myself returning to the books again and again.|Chance Thomas, [http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/23/chance-thomas-invades-middle-earth?page=2]}}
