'''Bri, Tolkienselskabet i København''' ("Bree, the Copenhagen Tolkien Society") is a Danish Tolkien Society. 

Bri was founded in [[1996]] as members of the [[Imladris, Danmarks Tolkienforening|Imladris]] and the now extinct [[Tolkiens Følge]] felt that Denmark lacked a society where members came together for various Tolkien-related activities such as banquets, discussions and guilds. 

==Guilds==

Bri has several guilds for its members:

The Arda Guild: For litterary discussions on Tolkien's work

The Archery Guild: For archers, mainly in order to beat the Swedish Tolkien Societies in an annual competition

Bri by Night: Very secret, so nothing can be revealed here.

The Gamers Guild: They play games. Any games.

The Drinking Guild: Visits beer festivals, wine testing, cider testing etc. (min. age limit of 18)

The Hobbit Guild: Meet at least quarterly and eat at least five courses. Hobbits only.

The Elder Races Food Guild: Everyone but the Hobbits meet and eat. Quality, not quantity.

The Craft Guild: Makes costumes, flags, banners, decorations etc.

The Town Guild: The board of Bri. 

==Publications==
Bri regularly publishes a magazine in Danish called ''[[http://www.bri.dk/Biblioteket/Pipeurten/Pipeurten.html Pipeurten]]'' ("Pipeweed").
