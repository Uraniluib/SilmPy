'''Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ([[1922]]-[[2015]])<ref>{{webcite|author=Anita Singh|articleurl=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11666316/christopher-lee-dies-live.html |articlename=Sir Christopher Lee dies at 93 - latest reaction and tributes|dated=11 June 2015|website=telegraph|accessed=14 February 2016}}</ref>was an English actor, who portrayed [[Saruman]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film trilogy]], and read the [[The Children of Húrin (audiobook)|''The Children of Húrin'' audiobook]].

==Life==
Lee had a long history with [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s fiction; he read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' after leaving the Royal Air Force in [[1945]], and since ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' came out, he read all Tolkien's books once a year. Lee also had the experience of actually meeting Tolkien in person (making him the only individual involved in the film trilogies to do so) while visiting [[The Eagle and Child]] during the 1950s:

{{Blockquote|We were sitting there talking and drinking beer, and someone said, "Oh, look who walked in." It was Professor Tolkien, and I nearly fell off my chair. I didn't even know he was alive. He was a benign looking man, smoking a pipe, walking in, an English countryman with earth under his feet. And he was a genius, a man of incredible intellectual knowledge. He knew somebody in our group. He (the man in the group) said "Oh Professor, Professor..." And he came over. And each one of us, well I knelt of course, each one of us said "how do you do?" And I just said "Ho.. How.. How..."|<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://christopherleeweb.com/forums/front-page-news/interview-christopher-lee-ian-mckellen-and-john-rhys-0|articlename=Interview with Christopher Lee, Ian Mckellen, and John Rhys|dated=|website=[http://christopherleeweb.com/ Christopherleeweb.com]|accessed=12 June 2013}}</ref>}}

Lee always envisioned himself as being [[Gandalf]], so when he read that [[Peter Jackson]] would be adapting his bedside book, he immediately called his agent. 

===Jackson===
Although he realized he was too old to play Gandalf, he read the part. He did not get it, but was called back as Saruman instead. He had never been in a movie with the actual Gandalf, [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], but the two quickly became friends, being the oldest actors on the set (though Lee was 17 years older). When McKellen was cast as Gandalf, Lee was 78 years old and McKellen was 61.

Lee shot most of his scenes in [[Wellington]], in the main studio, but also shot one scene in Wellington's national park. He visited [[New Zealand]] four times, the longest time being ten weeks. He later did some post-synching in London. 

While jet-lagged, Lee broke his hand smashing it against a wall. Several shots of him in the finished films show him carefully hiding this bandaged left hand.

===Other projects===
Known for his booming voice, Christopher Lee has sung operas, and performed with the [[Tolkien Ensemble]] on their CDs ''[[At Dawn in Rivendell]]'' and ''[[Leaving Rivendell]]''. He sang the role of [[Treebeard]], as well as reciting numerous other poems.

Lee has recounted his life and his connections with Tolkien's work in the foreword to [[Chris Smith]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare]]'', and in chapter 74, titled "Spellbinder", of his autobiography, ''Lord of Misrule''.

Lee agreed to reprise his role as Saruman for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]] on the condition that, due to his age, he did not have to fly out to New Zealand to be filmed.

==Quotations==
{{Blockquote|What Professor Tolkien achieved is unique in the literature of my lifetime. Indeed, in my opinion, he had reached the peak of literary invention of all time. Nothing like it has ever existed, and probably never will.|Christopher Lee, foreword to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare]]''}}
{{Blockquote|It's just going to be...I'm trying to think of the right word - without making it sound like the usual fashionable superlative. I think it will create film history. I think it's going to have the biggest impact, on screen, of anything of the last 40 or 50 years|Christopher Lee, SFX Magazine June #65}}
{{Blockquote|Saruman is number one. Saruman is, very definitely, the most brilliant, the most powerful, with the greatest intellect and the greatest knowledge. Gandalf...well he's number two. But Saruman's whole character becomes perverted and distorted and he lusts for power and gradually, as it very often does, the old famous quote 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely'.|Christopher Lee, Fox's [[Quest for the Ring]]}}
{{Blockquote|I did meet him [Tolkien], very briefly, in the Fifties. It was in a pub that he used to go to in Oxford, called the Eagle and Child. I was there having a beer and I was completely overcome when he walked in. I had already started reading the books and thought, "This man has created a unique form of literature - one of the great works of all time." While I was filming The Lord of the Rings, I thought about what he would have thought all the time, and hope he would have approved. I'm still an enormous fan - I read The Lord of the Rings every year.|[http://web.archive.org/web/20100925072809/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/christopher-lee-you-ask-the-questions-735506.html ''The Independent'', 11 February 2009]}}
