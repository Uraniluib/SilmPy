At an unknown date, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to [[Christopher Tolkien]]'''. An interview with Christopher includes the following passage:

''"I was a fighter pilot. When I landed, I would read a chapter,"'' [Christopher Tolkien] ''says, amused, showing a letter in which his father asks his advice on the formation of a proper noun."''<ref>{{webcite|author=Raphaëlle Rérolle|articleurl=http://sedulia.blogs.com/sedulias_translations/2012/07/was-first-felt.html|articlename=Christopher Tolkien interviewed by ''Le Monde''|dated=|website=|accessed=16 July 2012}}</ref>

The letter is apparently not included in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.
