'''Jon Brackenbook''' was a character created specifically for [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]. 

He learnt that [[Calder Cob]] was a traitor, but his father, the captain of [[Archet]], did not believe him until it was too late. The [[Blackwolds]] attacked [[Archet]] and Jon came to the town's defense. During the attack Jon's father was slain and Jon became captain of Archet.<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>
