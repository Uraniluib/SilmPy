'''Mardil Voronwë''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1960|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 204</ref> – {{TA|2080|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 120 years) was Steward under the kings [[Eärnil II]] and [[Eärnur]], and then became the first Ruling [[Steward of Gondor]].
==History==
In {{TA|2029}}, Mardil succeeded his father [[Vorondil]] as the second hereditary Steward of Gondor (a tradition begun with his grandfather [[Pelendur]]).<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

When Eärnil II died in {{TA|2043}} and Eärnur ascended to the throne, the King of [[Minas Morgul]] (the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]) challenged him to single combat.  Mardil was able to restrain Eärnur' wrath at that time, but in {{TA|2050}} the King of Morgul renewed his challenge, adding taunts that Eärnur could not ignore.  Mardil was powerless to prevent Eärnur from riding to Minas Morgul; he and his small escort were never heard from again.

Eärnur had died unmarried with no heirs.  Royal descendants had become few and no claimant for the throne could be found of pure [[Númenórean]] blood, or whose claim all would accept, and people were afraid of a new [[Kin-strife]] that would devastate the kingdom.  Thus, by default, Mardil began the line of Ruling Stewards of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule in the King's name until "the King returns". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards.

Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the epithet ''Voronwë'', which means "the Steadfast" in [[Quenya]]. One of his works was to introduce and establish the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] in Gondor. He inserted two leap-days in the year {{TA|2050}}.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
