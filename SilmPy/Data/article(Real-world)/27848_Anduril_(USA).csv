Only one issue was published (Summer 1962; held at the Marquette Hunnewell collection). Anduril is said to be "the first Tolkien fanzine ever", and according to the [[Marquette Library]], the "[p]ublication of Anduril ceased when rumors surfaced that Tolkien did not like it".<ref>[http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=AndurilUSFanzine Tolkien Collector’s Guide], as of July 22, 2010</ref>
