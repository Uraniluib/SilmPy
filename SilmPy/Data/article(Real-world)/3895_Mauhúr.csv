'''Mauhúr''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] in the service of [[Saruman]].

==History==
Mauhúr was sent to reinforce [[Uglúk]]'s troop as they returned to [[Isengard]] with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. He found them surrounded by [[Éomer]]'s [[Rohirrim]] at the edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], from which he led his Orcs in an attack. This attack was a failure: the Rohirrim were able to defeat the Orcs, even with Mauhúr's reinforcements.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref> Though Mauhúr's own fate is not known with certainty, it seems that he fell with his soldiers at the hands of the Rohirrim.
