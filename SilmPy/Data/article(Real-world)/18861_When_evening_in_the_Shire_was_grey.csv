<poem>
''When evening in [[the Shire]] was grey
''his footsteps on [[the Hill]] were heard;
''before the dawn he went away
''on journey long without a word.

''From  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] to Western shore,
''from northern waste to southern hill,
''through [[Smaug|dragon-lair]] and [[Lonely Mountain|hidden door]]
''and [[Mirkwood|darkling woods]] he walked at will.

''With [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] and [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], [[Elves]] and [[Men]],
''with mortal and [[Maiar|immortal folk]],
''with [[Great Eagles|bird]] on bough and [[Beorn|beast]] in den,
''in their own secret tongues he spoke.

''A deadly [[Glamdring|sword]], a healing hand,
''a back that bent beneath his load;
''a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,
''a weary [[mithrandir|pilgrim]] on the road.

''A lord of wisdom throned he sat,
''swift in anger, quick to laugh;
''an old man in a battered hat
''who leaned upon a thorny staff.

''He stood upon the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm|bridge]] alone
''and [[Durin's Bane|Fire and Shadow]] both defied;
''his staff was broken on the stone,
''in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] his wisdom died.''</poem>

Upon hearing this poem [[Samwise Gamgee]] suggested another stanza:

<poem>
''The finest rockets ever seen:
''they burst in stars of blue and green,
''or after thunder golden showers
''came falling like a rain of flowers.''</poem>
