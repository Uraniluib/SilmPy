'''''In Elven Lands''''' is an album by [[The Fellowship (band)|The Fellowship]], released on [[31 January]] [[2006]]. [[The Fellowship (band)|The Fellowship]] take a musicological approach to imagine how the ancient cultures described by J.R.R. Tolkien might have sounded, performing on an all-acoustic array of ancient and modern instruments that includes harp, lute, hurdy-gurdy, krumhorn and gong among a wide variety of others. 

The subject matter for the songs on ''In Elven Lands'' are drawn from aspects of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], including stories from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The album title, ''In Elven Lands'', is taken from the lyrics of their song 'Beware The Wolf': 

''...let us ride before the break of day, through woven woods in Elven lands, to find the starry-jeweled hand...''

==Languages==
The songs on the First Edition of ''In Elven Lands'' are written in Modern English, [[Anglo-Saxon]], and a kind of [[Neo-Elvish]] consisting of intentionally corrupted versions of Proto-[[Quenya]] (the so-called "Elf-Latin") and [[Noldorin]]/[[Sindarin]].

The Second Edition also introduces [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]]'s [[Neo-Elvish|Neo-Quenya]] in the song ''Silmesse.'' With the departure of guest artist Jon Anderson from the Second Edition, two of the songs in Modern English have been removed, leaving only three songs in Modern English, as opposed to eight in [[Elvish]] dialects.

According to the album notes in the Second Edition, the language usage was intended to create the impression of a corrupt later text, such as Tolkien described in the Introduction and Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In order to create the illusion of a corrupt text (or in this case, a series of corrupt texts), the authors used Proto-Quenya and Proto-Sindarin vocabulary taken from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]'' (Volumes [[The Book of Lost Tales Part One|1]] and [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|2]]) and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. They then intentionally mutated words to account for the shifting palate, used loan-words from other languages from Arda, and in one case simply mangled the pronunciation and re-transcribed the results to show the effects of the "folk music process" that often occurs over time.
