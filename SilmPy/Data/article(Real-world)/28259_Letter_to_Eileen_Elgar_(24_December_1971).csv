==Excerpts==

"[Edith] was my ''Lúthien Tinúviel'', with her river [''sic''? as transcribed, for "raven"] hair and fair face and bright starry eyes"

"I am glad that you have discovered <u>Narnia</u>. These stories are deservedly very popular; but since you ask if <u>I</u> like them I am afraid the answer is <u>No</u>. I do <u>not</u> like 'allegory', and least of all religious allegory of this kind. But that is a difference of taste which we both recognized and did not interfere with our friendship."<ref>Quoted in "Disparaging Narnia: Reconsidering Tolkien's View of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''" by Josh B. Long, in [[Mythlore 121/122|''Mythlore'' 121/122]], p. 39</ref>
