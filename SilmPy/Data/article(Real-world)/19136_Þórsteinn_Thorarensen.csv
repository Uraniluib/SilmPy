'''Þorsteinn Thorarensen''' is an Icelandic translator who translated ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as "Hobbitinn eða út og heim aftur" ([[1997]]) and "Hringadróttinssaga" ([[1993]]-[[1995]]) respectively. A curious fact in his translations is that he translated all names into Icelandic. All of them.

In [[Vinyar Tengwar 42]], [[Arden R. Smith]] gives an impressive list of many names that can be found in Thorarensen's translation. These include the Norse names ("[[Gandalf|Gandalfur]]", "[[Thorin|Þorinn Eikinskjaldi]]") and the Old English ("[[Helm|Hjálmur]]", "[[Éomer|Jómar]]", "[[Théoden|Þjóðan]]"), but also the [[Elvish]] names. One finds such names as "[[Bregalad|Bréglaður]]", "[[Durthang|Dyrþanki]]", "[[Hirluin|Hýrlúnn]]" and "[[Halbarad|Hallbarður]]". Appendices [[Appendix E|E]] and [[Appendix F|F]] are not translated, so it is unknown what Thorarensen would have made of that.

In [[1978]], [[Úlfur Ragnarsson]] and [[Karl Ágúst Úlfsson]] published a translation of ''The Hobbit''. There are no other Icelandic translations of ''The Lord of the Rings''.
