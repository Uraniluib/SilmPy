'''Tolkien metal''' is a sub-genre of ''black metal'' music, influenced by the work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]. It is more atmospheric and ambient than original black metal, and the lyrics are about Tolkien's work. The band [[Summoning]] is the most notable Tolkien metal band, while [[Isengard (band)|Isengard]] has infuenced many.

Although their genre is not black metal, bands like [[Blind Guardian]], [[Battlelore]] and [[Rivendell (band)|Rivendell]] can be described as Tolkien metal because of their lyrics. However, the name was specifically created for Summoning and its kind.
