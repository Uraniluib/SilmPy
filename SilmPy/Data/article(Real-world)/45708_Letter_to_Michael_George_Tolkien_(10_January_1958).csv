{{blockquote|Many Happy Returns of your birthday! I failed to reach the P. Office today, or I should have sent you a small contribution (at the rate of a bob a year!). However, I have asked your father to do so on my behalf. Very much love to you, & I hope next term will prove better than usual.<br/><br/>Your Grandfather}}
