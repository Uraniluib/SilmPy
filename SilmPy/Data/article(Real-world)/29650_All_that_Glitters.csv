'''''All that glitters''''' is an EP or mini-album by [[Soundestiny]] that was released in 2009.

This is a short CD of music inspired by ''[[The Hobbit]]'' with original songs written by Darryl Grant Potter. In 2009, [[Soundestiny]] were busily recording a full length album of Hobbit-inspired songs and decided to take a break from the project to finish their [[Winds of Change]] album. Consequently, it was decided to release four of the already-recorded ''Hobbit'' songs as an EP; the full album of songs inspired by [[The Hobbit]] was released in 2012 as [[Dragon Quest]]. The four songs on ''All that Glitters'' are a brief, musical glimpse into [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s magical, fantasy world that later became even more famous with the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
