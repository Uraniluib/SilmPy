}}'''Tar-Minastir''' ({{SA|1474}} – {{SA|1873|n}}, aged 399 years) was the 11th [[King of Númenor]], ruling for 138 years, from {{SA|1731}} to {{SA|1869|n}}. 
==History==
Tar-Minastir was the grandson of King [[Tar-Súrion]]. Before becoming King he used the name Minastir. He succeeded his aunt, Queen [[Tar-Telperiën]]. His name meant "Tower Watcher", which he acquired after building a tall tower upon the hill of [[Oromet]], near [[Andúnië]], in order to gaze westwards.<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Minastir</ref>

During his time, in [[Middle-earth]], [[Sauron]] invaded [[Eriador]] from [[Calenardhon]] in {{SA|1695}} and the realms of [[Eregion]] fell.  He then advanced to [[Lindon]] and besieged [[Rivendell]]. In {{SA|1700|n}} Minastir (who envied the [[Eldar]], but nonetheless he loved them<ref name=app>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>) sent a navy under the command of [[Ciryatur]] to save Lindon. Ciryatur's forces stopped Sauron's army in the clash known as [[Battle of the Gwathló]] and reinforcements from Lindon and [[Tharbad]] helped defeat the enemy. Sauron retreated back to [[Mordor]].<ref name="Galad">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref name=app/>

Starting around the 1800s, the Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in [[Middle-earth]], including the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]].<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

Tar-Minastir abdicated in 1869 and was succeeded by his son, [[Tar-Ciryatan]].<ref name="Kings"/> Tar-Minastir was one of the last "good" Kings of the realm, as his successors started becoming greedy.<ref name=app/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In ''The Tale of Years'' it is stated that Tar-Minastir sent a great navy from Númenor to Lindon in {{SA|1700}}.<ref name="SA"/>  This event and date are restated in ''The History of Galadriel and Celeborn'', mentioning Tar-Minastir again.<ref name="Galad"/>  Yet in ''The Line of Elros'' Tar-Telperiën is said to have lived to {{SA|1731}} and not have given up the Sceptre until that time, which would mean she was the ruler of Númenor when the great navy was sent.  [[Christopher Tolkien]] could not account for this discrepancy.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Note 9</ref>
