==Summary==
Christopher Tolkien was in an RAF training camp in [[South Africa]] since January, and his father wrote regularly.

The fragment had three trivial subjects. Tolkien started his letter telling about the return of the "Useless Quack", [[Robert Havard]], who had joined the Navy medical corps and was on leave in [[Oxford]]. He then told of [[C.S. Lewis]] and the inaccuracy of the press (concerning Mr. Lewis), and closed the letter with a remark about the weather.
