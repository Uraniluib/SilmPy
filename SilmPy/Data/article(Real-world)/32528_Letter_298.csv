==Summary==
Tolkien gave White a brief account of the name ''Inklings'' from memory since the group had no recorder.  The name's origin was an undergraduate jest.  It had been founded in the mid-thirties by then undergraduate [[wikipedia:Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye-Lean]], whose ambition was to found a club that would prove lasting.  To that end he invited some "dons".  [[C.S. Lewis]] was Tangye-Lean’s mentor; both he and Tolkien joined.  They met in Tangye-Lean's rooms in University College and at each meeting members were to read aloud unpublished compositions.  There would be immediate criticism and if thought fit, contributions could be voted into a Record Book that Tolkien kept.

That club soon died but its name transferred to a circle of C.S. Lewis’ friends who met in his room in Magdalen.  Had the first club never existed C.S. Lewis would have created it, for he had a passion for out-loud readings and a facility for extempore criticism beyond the others.

The name was a "jest", said Tolkien, because it was an ingenious pun suggesting people with vague or half-formed intimations who dabbled in ink.  C.S. Lewis never claimed to have invented this name.
==Controversy==
According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]], the letter ''"was printed, apparently without permission, with Tolkien's address and private telephone number at the head of it, in White's book"'' (''[[The Image of Man in C.S. Lewis]]'').
