'''''There and Back Again: J.R.R. Tolkien and the Origins of The Hobbit''''' is a study of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s sources for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[Mark Atherton]].

==From the publisher==
'Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.' The prophetic words of [[Galadriel]], addressed to Frodo as he prepared to travel from [[Lothl√≥rien]] to [[Mordor]] to destroy [[the One Ring]], are just as pertinent to J.R.R. Tolkien's own fiction. For decades, [[hobbits]] and the other fantastical creatures of Middle-earth have captured the imaginations of a fiercely loyal tribe of readers, all enhanced by the immense success of [[Peter Jackson]]'s films: first The Lord of the Rings, and now his new The Hobbit. But for all Tolkien's global fame and the familiarity of modern culture with [[Gandalf]], Bilbo, Frodo and Sam, the sources of the great mythmaker's own myth-making have been neglected. Mark Atherton here explores the chief influences on Tolkien's work: his boyhood in the West Midlands; the landscapes and seascapes which shaped his mythologies; his experiences in World War I; his interest in Scandinavian myth; his friendships, especially with the other Oxford-based [[Inklings]]; and the relevance of his themes, especially ecological themes, to the present-day. There and Back Again offers a unique guide to the varied inspirations behind Tolkien's life and work, and sheds new light on how a legend is born.
