'''The Lhammas''' is the fifth chapter of the second section, <nowiki>'</nowiki>Part Two: Valinor and Middle-earth before ''The Lord of the Rings''<nowiki>'</nowiki>, of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''.

==Synopsis==
The ''Lhammas'' comprises a linguistic account attributed to [[Pengolod]] of [[Gondolin]], which he authored on [[Tol Eressea]], based on some earlier work of [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil of Tun]]. A note suggests that it was one of the sources of [[Aelfwine]] who had seen the work. ''Lhammas'' is actually comprised of two versions of the same revised text. The later and third form of the text, having the title '''''Lammasethen''''', is shorter and deviates from the ''Lhammas'' at some points.

The essay represents an old linguistic view of the [[Languages]] of [[Middle-earth]] which was later dropped, in which all languages belonged to either the [[Valarin]], [[Oromëan]], [[Aulëan]], or [[Melkian]] phylums:

* The ''Valarin'' phylum is the origin of all other phylums and led to [[Valarin]] (the language of the [[Valar]].)
* ''Oromëan'' is named after the Vala [[Oromë]] and is used for all languages of the [[Elves]], because Oromë taught the Elves language. Most languages of [[Men]] also belong to this phylum.
* ''Aulëan'' is named after the Vala [[Aulë]], father of the [[Dwarves]], and is the origin of the [[Khuzdul]] language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.
* ''Melkian'' is named after the fallen Vala [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (or Morgoth) and is the origin of the [[Black Speech]] of the [[Orcs]] and other evil beings.

Tolkien later revised and simplified the linguistic history of his world, and some elements cannot be applied to the later languages of Middle-earth. However, Tolkien in later writings still held that [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] wrote '''''L'''ammas'', but himself never wrote an "updated" form that would be coherent with his later mythology.
==Etymology==
The name ''lhammas'' is [[Noldorin]] and roughly means "assortment of languages" (cf. Quenya word ''[[lambë]]''). When Tolkien revised the history of the languages and Noldorin became [[Sindarin]], he renamed the word as ''lammas'' (initial ''lh'' changed to ''l''. See also: [[Noldorin]]).
