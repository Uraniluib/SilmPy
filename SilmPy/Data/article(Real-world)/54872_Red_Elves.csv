The '''Red Elves''', or '''Red Gnomes''', lived at the [[wikipedia:North_Pole|North Pole]] with [[Father Christmas]] in the ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]''. They were first mentioned in a letter written on [[30 November]], [[1932]]. They were known to live in [[wikipedia:Norway|Norway]].

==History==
The Red Elves were sent for by Father Christmas in 1932, and helped him and the [[North Polar Bear]] capture many [[Goblins]]. They appeared again the [[1933|next year]] around [[21 November]] to help deal with another goblin attack. In the battle that followed, many Red Elves got hurt. In [[1934]], the Red Elves were invited to a special [[wikipedia:Boxing_Day|Boxing Day]] party. About a week before the next Christmas, the Red Elves enjoyed their time shoveling out Father Christmas' house. That year, they received magic sparkler spears to scare golbins away. During [[1936]], many Red Elves moved to [[Cliff House]].
