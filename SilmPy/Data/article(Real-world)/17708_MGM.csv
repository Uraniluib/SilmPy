'''Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.''' is a motion picture company.

MGM, through its subsidiary [[United Artists]], owns the distribution rights (but not the production rights) to screen adaptations of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The company's precarious financial situation caused delays to [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]], which it was under contract to co-finance, as well as the departure of its initially planned director [[Guillermo del Toro]] from the project.<ref>TheOneRing.net: [http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/03/27/35768-source-mgm-situation-of-great-importance-to-the-hobbit-films/ Source says the MGM situation of ‘great importance’ to two potential ‘Hobbit’ films].
