{{Pronounce|Galdor.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Galdor''' ({{FA|417}} –{{FA| 462|n}}, aged 45 years) was the second child and elder son of [[Hador]]. He led the [[House of Hador|People of Hador]] when they were at the peak of their power, before the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Galdor was noted for his exceptional height, even among the [[Edain]], and was also called '''Galdor the Tall'''.<ref name="Ruin"/> 
==History==
Galdor had a younger brother named [[Gundor]] and an older sister named [[Glóredhel]].<ref name="WJwest">{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador''</ref>

At a great feast of the Edain, Galdor married [[Hareth]] and Glóredhel married [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]], both children of [[Halmir]], chief of the [[House of Haleth]].<ref name="Ruin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>  Galdor and [[Hareth]] had two sons, [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

In the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}}, both Galdor's father, Hador, and his younger brother, Gundor, died in the rearguard of the Elf-lord [[Fingolfin]].  Galdor then succeeded his father as Lord of [[Dor-lómin]].  In the wake of [[Morgoth]]'s triumph the wife of [[Barahir]], [[Emeldir]], gathered the women and children of [[Dorthonion]] and led them westward; some found refuge in Galdor's domain.

The sons of Galdor, Húrin and Huor, had been taken after the Dagor Bragollach into the hidden city of [[Gondolin]] by the eagles of [[Thorondor]].  When they departed from the city (again carried by eagles) they returned to Dor-lómin where they would not reveal where they had been, even to their father.

Seven years after the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth sent a great force against [[Hithlum]], attacking the passes of the [[Ered Wethrin]].  Galdor defended the [[Eithel Sirion]] and was slain by an arrow.<ref name="Ruin"/>
