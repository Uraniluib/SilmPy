==Summary==
Tolkien complained that the small map "[[A Part of the Shire|Part of the Shire]]" was faulty, needing corrections and additions.  [[Bucklebury Ferry]], [[Brandy Hall]], and [[Crickhollow]] were 3 miles too far north (about 4 millimeters).  It was unfortunate that Brandy Hall, clearly on the river-bank, was placed where the main road ran in front instead of behind it.  Also missing was the wood described in "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]".<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>
