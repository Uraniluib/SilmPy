INTRODUCTION

Within this book is held the tale of the history of the land known as the Mûmakan and an organization of Evil known as the Court of Ardor. Also told is the story of the preparations of the Court for a cataclysm which, if it were to occur, would have dire repercussions not only for the lands of the Mûmakan, but all of Middle-earth.

Long ago in the dim past of Endor Elven lords came to this southerly area, to a land swathed in warm mists and overgrown with wild yet beautiful trees and vines, and inhabited by all manner of creatures. It was vastly different from the forests and plains to the North, yet the Elves loved it and named it Ardor (S: 'Exalted Land'). Many centuries passed, and the Immortal Children of Eru lived in peace, until the Shadow fell upon the land and many of the strong were seduced by the clever words of servants of the Black Enemy: Morgoth. Power and wisdom were promised, if they would but perform this one task. Naive were these Elves in the Elder days, and they made oaths lightly, little knowing how heavily this would weigh upon them in the millennia to come. Eagerly they took council and formed a Court of sorts; a hierarchy of lords and ladies to effect this mission for their master. And a Darkness of spirit fell upon the land: a harbinger of the true dark which was to follow should their scheme come to fruition.

Ages passed, and men, the younger Children, came and settled in Ardor, giving it a name in their own tongues - Mûmakan, after the huge beasts which roam the region. But Ardor still it was to the Court, and Ardor it would be again, when the eternal night fell upon all of Middle-earth.
