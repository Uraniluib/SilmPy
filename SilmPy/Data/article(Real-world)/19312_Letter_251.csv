==Summary==
Tolkien told [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]] of the funeral service of [[C.S. Lewis]], who had died four days earlier.  Tolkien had been feeling the normal feeling of a man of his age - like an old tree slowly losing its leaves.  However, the loss of Lewis had been like an axe-blow to the roots.  The service was attended by [[Christopher Tolkien]], [[James Dundas-Grant]], [[Robert Havard]], [[Owen Barfield]] and several others.  Tolkien thanked his daughter for writing.
