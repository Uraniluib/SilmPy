"Farewell, O twice beloved! A Túrin Turambar turun ambartanen: master of doom by doom mastered! O happy to be dead!" -[[Nienor]], - Page 223<br><br>

"Thus it was in [[Gondolin]]; and amid all the bliss of that realm, while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown." - Page 139<br><br>

"Last of all [[Húrin]] stood alone. Then he cast aside his shield, and wielded an axe two-handed; and it is sung that the axe smoked in the black blood of the troll-guard of Gothmog until it withered, and each time that he slew Húrin cried 'Aurë entuluva! Day shall come again!' Seventy times he uttered that cry; but they took him at last alive..." - Page 195<br><br>

"But the dawn is brief and the day full often belies its promise."<br><br>

"The one had leaves of dark green that beneath were as shining silver, and from each of his countless flowers a dew of silver light was ever falling, and the earth beneath was dappled with the shadows of his fluttering leaves." Page 38<br><br>

"Keen, heart-piercing was her song as the song of the lark that rises from the gates of night and pours its voice among the dying stars, seeing the sun behind the walls of the world; and the song of [[Lúthien]] released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed." - Page 165<br><br>

"[[Fëanor]] was the mightiest in skill of word and of hand, more learned than his brothers; his spirit burned as a flame. [[Fingolfin]] was the strongest, the most steadfast, and the most valiant. [[Finarfin]] was the fairest, and the most wise of heart..." - Page 60<br><br>

"...for if joyful is the fountain that rises in the sun, its springs are in the wells of sorrow unfathomed at the foundations of the [[Arda|Earth]]."<br><br>

"The [[Nazgûl]] they were; the Ringwraiths, the Enemy's most terrible servants; darkness went with them and they cried with the voices of death." - Page 289 [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]<br><br>

"None and none! What I have left behind I count now no loss; needless baggage on the road it has proved. Let those that cursed my name, curse me still, and whine their way back to the cages of the [[Valar]]! Let the ships burn!" -Fëanor, Page 90<br><br>

"Their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]] shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very treasures that they have sworn to pursue." - page 88 -[[Mandos]], [[The Silmarillion]], [[Of the Flight of the Noldor]]<br><br>

"Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the [[Noldor]], and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted [[Rochallor]] his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He passed over [[Dor-nu-Fauglith]] like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking [[Oromë]] himself was come; for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to [[Angband]]'s gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once upon the brazen doors, and challenged [[Morgoth]] to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came."- Page 153<br><br>

"'Hail [[Gurthang]]! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou therefore take [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], wilt thou slay me swiftly ?' And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: 'Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of [[Beleg]] my master, and the blood of [[Brandir]] slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.' Then Túrin set the hilt upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade took his life." - Page 225<br><br>

"With their whips of flame they smote asunder the webs of [[Ungoliant]], and she quailed, and turned to fight, belching black vapours to cover her; and fleeing from the north she went down into Beleriand, and dwelt beneath [[Ered Gorgoroth]], in that dark valley that was after called [[Nan Dungortheb]], the Valley of Dreadful Death, because of the horror she bred there. For other foul creatures of spider form had dwelt there since the days of the delving of Angband, and she mated with them, and devoured them; and even after Ungoliant herself departed, and went whither she would into the forgotten south of the world, her offspring abode there and wove their hideous webs. Of the fate of Ungoliant, no tale tells. Yet some have said that she ended long ago, when in her uttermost famine she devoured herself at last." - Page 81<br><br>

"If it has passed from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin, that was of old the fate of [[Arda]] Marred; and if any change shall come and the Marring be amended, [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]] may know; but they have not revealed it, and it is not declared in the dooms of Mandos."<br><br>

"We have sworn, and not lightly. This oath we will keep. We are threatened with many evils, and treason not least; but one thing is not said: that we shall suffer from cowardice, from cravens or the fear of cravens. Therefore I say that we will go on, and this doom I add: the deeds that we shall do shall be the matter of song until the last days of Arda." -Fëanor, Page 88<br><br>

"...thou, [[Morgoth|Melkor]], shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined." - Page 17<br><br>
 
"But of [[Gandalf|Olórin]] that tale does not speak; for though he loved the [[Elves]], he walked among them unseen, or in form as one of them, and they did not know whence came the fair visions or the promptings of wisdom that he put into their hearts. In later days he was the friend of all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and took pity on their sorrows; and those who listened to him awoke from despair and put away the imaginations of darkness." - Page 31<br><br>
 
"It was a hollow land, surrounded by mountains and great coast-cliffs higher than the plains behind, and no river flowed thence; and there was great mere in the midst of Nevrast, with no certain shores, being encircled by wide marshes. Linaewen was the name of that mere, because of the multitude of birds that dwelt there, of such as love tall reeds and shallow pools..." - Page 119<br><br>
