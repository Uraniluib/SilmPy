==Quotes==

In an interview with The New York Times, Pratchett was asked “Who are your favorite fantasy novelists?” to which he replied:

{{blockquote|O.K., I give in. J. R. R. Tolkien. I wrote a letter to him once and got a very nice reply. Just think how busy he would have been, and yet he took the time out to write to a fan.|<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/books/review/terry-pratchett-by-the-book.html?_r=0|articlename=Terry Pratchett: By the Book|website=[http://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times]|accessed=12 March 2015}}</ref>}}

In another interview Pratchett wass asked: "Why do you feel uncomfortable with being ahead of Tolkien?" and he replied:
{{blockquote|I think Tolkien will be around in a hundred years time but I’m not certain that I will.|<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.gamesradar.com/interview_terry_pratchett/|articlename=INTERVIEW Terry Pratchett|website=[http://www.gamesradar.com/ GamesRadar]|accessed=12 March 2015}}</ref>}}

{{blockquote|“[W]hen I was young I wrote a letter to J.R.R. Tolkien, just as he was becoming extravagantly famous. I think the book that impressed me was Smith of Wootton Major. Mine must have been among hundreds or thousands of letters he received every week. I got a reply. It might have been dictated. For all I know, it might have been typed to a format. But it was signed. He must have had a sackful of letters from every commune and university in the world, written by people whose children are now grown-up and trying to make a normal life while being named Galadriel or Moonchild. It wasn’t as if I’d said a lot. There were no numbered questions. I just said that I’d enjoyed the book very much. And he said thank you. For a moment, it achieved the most basic and treasured of human communications: you are real, and therefore so am I.”<ref>Terry Pratchett, ''A Slip of the Keyboard: Collected Non-Fiction'' (p. 73)</ref>}}
