'''Appendix C''' of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' contains several family trees of notable [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] Families. According to the introduction of the appendix, the names shown are just a selection:
<blockquote>The names given in these Trees are only a selection from many. Most of them are either guests at Bilbo's [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]], or their direct ancestors. .... A few other names of persons concerned in the events recounted are also given. In addition some genealogical information is provided concerning [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] the founder of the family of [[Gardner Family|Gardner]], later famous and influential.<br>
The figures after the names are those of birth (and death where that is recorded).
