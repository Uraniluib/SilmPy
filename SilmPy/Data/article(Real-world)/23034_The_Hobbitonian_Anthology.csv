'''''The Hobbitonian Anthology''''' is a book by [[Mark T. Hooker]], illustrated by [[James Dunning]].

==Reception==

[[John D. Rateliff]], in his review of ''The Hobbitonian Anthology'' in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'', praises Hooker for being a "indefatigable researcher". However, the review is largely negative, and Rateliff's main criticism concerns the alleged tendency in the book to make too bold claims about etymological links between Tolkien's invented names and possible real-world sources.<ref>[[John D. Rateliff]], "Review of ''The Hobbitonian Anthology''", in {{TS|7}}, pp. 330-5</ref> Mark T. Hooker responded to the review, and to the editors of ''Tolkien Studies'', in an "Open Letter", stating that Rateliff is an "unqualified reviewer" and criticizes him for making a number of wrong conclusions about the book.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Mark T.

[[Hither Shore (journal) |''Hither Shore'']], the [[ Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft e.V. | German Tolkien Society]]'s peer-reviewed annual, says: Hooker “displays a thorough knowledge of linguistics, etymology, and history, and is also very well versed with even obscure sources of literature. … All in all, this book is a highly interesting and worthwhile read for anyone interested in speculating about how and why Tolkien used language the way he did."<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Mark T.

==From the Publisher==
This monograph is the second collection of analytic articles on [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s "[[The Lord of the Rings]]" and "[[The Hobbit]]," written by Tolkien scholar and Comparative Translationist [[Mark T. Hooker]], most famous, perhaps, for his application of Comparative Translation to the study of Tolkien. 

The collection is a miscellany, but largely linguistic in nature. 
* Part One of the book is about names: [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Bag End]], [[Boffin Family|Boffin]], [[Farmer Maggot]], [[Puddifoot Family|Puddifoot]], [[Stoors|Stoor]], [[William|Huggins]], [[Tom Bombadil]], [[Ivy Bush|The Ivy Bush]], [[The Golden Perch]], and a bevy of place names, including the [[Four Shire Stone]] and the Rollright Stones in the neighborhood of [[Evesham]], the ancestral home of Tolkien’s mother’s family, the [[Mabel Suffield|Suffield]]s. The articles in Part One discuss the meanings of these names and their English analogues, both from a linguistic, a geographic, and biographic viewpoint. 
* The articles in Part Two explore the terms bootless, nine days’ wonder, [[Uncommon words|confusticate]] and bebother, [[Uncommon words|hundredweight]], and [[Uncommon words|leechcraft]]. 
* In Part Three, Hooker continues his work in translation studies, looking at the Bulgarian, Belorussian, Czech, Slovak, Dutch, German, Polish, Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian translations of "The Hobbit" with a series of comparative pieces on how the translators handled Tolkien’s nomenclature.
* Part Four is an examination of the Russian translations of "[[Leaf by Niggle]]."
