'''The Steward and the King''' is the fifth chapter of the second book in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

==Summary==
The narrative jumps back to the time before the quest is finished, now focusing on the perspective of those in [[Minas Tirith]]. While [[Aragorn]] and the forces of [[Gondor]] were away, the city remained shrouded in fear. [[Faramir]] met Lady [[Éowyn]] in the [[Houses of Healing]]. Éowyn longed for Aragorn and the chance to fight with the [[Éored|Riders]] of [[Rohan]] against [[Mordor]]. Her sadness, mixed with pride and beauty, led Faramir to fall in love with her. For days, they stared to the east, waiting for word of Gondor’s success, until they eventually saw the Darkness break. As sunlight broke through the sky, the citizens of Minas Tirith broke out in song. Messengers soon arrived telling of Aragorn’s victory.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> The conflict resolved, Éowyn’s longing for war faded, and she and Faramir agreed to wed.

When Aragorn returned, Faramir rode out of the gate of Minas Tirith and offered him the keys of the city and an ancient crown. To everyone’s amazement, Aragorn called for the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] and [[Gandalf]]. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] handed the crown to Gandalf, who placed it upon Aragorn’s brow.

The city of Minas Tirith began to revive. Its walls were restored, and the city was filled with trees, fountains, and laughter. Ambassadors from many lands arrived in Gondor, and Aragorn showed mercy by rewarding both the faithful and the enemies of the West. Gandalf explained that the [[Third Age]] of [[Middle-earth]] had passed: the war against [[Sauron]] was over, and Aragorn’s reign in the age of [[Men]] had begun. The group climbed up an ancient, snowy path, at the end of which, amidst a pile of debris, Aragorn found a sapling of the great [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]]—the symbol of ancient [[Elendil]], Gondor’s kingdom. Aragorn took the sapling back to the Citadel. The old, dead tree was removed and laid to rest, and the new one planted in its place.

The day before Midsummer, a group of [[Elves]] approached Minas Tirith. [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]], [[Elrohir]] and [[Elladan]], and all the Elf princes arrived in the city. Behind them, mightiest of all, was [[Elrond]] with his daughter, [[Arwen]]. On the day of Midsummer, Aragorn (now called King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]) and Arwen were wed. Queen Arwen, seeking to repay Frodo for his immeasurable service and suffering, offered him a gift. When the time came, he may sail in her stead across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to the unknown West, where the Elves dwelt in eternal youth and joy.
