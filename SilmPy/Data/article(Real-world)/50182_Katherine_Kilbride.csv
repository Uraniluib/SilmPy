'''Katherine 'Kitty' Kilbride''' ([[1900]]-[[1966]]) was a student of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[E.V. Gordon]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. Kilbride would become a good friend of Tolkien.

Kilbride was “an invalid all her life”, according to her nephew, “and was much cheered by [Tolkien’s] chatty letters and cards ... books were given to her as they were published”.<ref name=>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/hobbit-first-edition-with-jrr-tolkiens-inscription-doubles-sales-record Hobbit first edition with JRR Tolkien's inscription doubles sales record|dated=|website=[http://www.theguardian.com/ theguardian.com/]|accessed=7 June 2015}}</ref>

She was among the recipients to whom Tolkien sent inscribed editions of the newly published ''[[The Hobbit]]'', on or close after [[21 September]] [[1937]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 201</ref>
