'''Aragorn'''
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Where now are the DÃºnedain, Elessar, Elessar? 
Why do thy kinsfolk wander afar? 
Near is the hour when the Lost should come forth, 
And the Grey Company ride from the North. 
But dark is the path appointed for thee: 
The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea. 
</poem>
'''Legolas'''
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Legolas Greenleaf long under tree 
In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! 
If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, 
Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.' 
</poem>
'''Gimli'''
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Lock-bearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. 
But have a care to lay thine axe to the right tree!" 
</poem>
