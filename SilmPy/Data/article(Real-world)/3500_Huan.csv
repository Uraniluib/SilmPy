'''Huan''', the '''Hound of Valinor''', (d. {{FA|466}}<ref>{{GA|186}}</ref><ref group=note>Beren died in the same year as Huan did</ref>) was a great [[dogs|wolfhound]], one of the hunting dogs of [[Oromë]] the Hunter. 

Huan had been granted special powers by the [[Valar]], he was as large as a small horse, immortal, tireless and sleepless, and was allowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest [[Wolves|wolf]] that ever lived; in this case a [[werewolf]].
==History==
[[File:Tuuliky - Celegorm the Fair.jpg|thumb|left|Tuuliky - ''Celegorm the Fair'']]
Huan was given by Oromë to his friend [[Celegorm]], one of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] and accompanied him on his huntings in the regions of [[Valinor]]. When the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] under [[Fëanor]] rebelled, Huan went with his master to [[Middle-earth]]. Presumably he was with his master while he dwelt in [[Himlad]], and then when he retreated to [[Nargothrond]] by the late 5th century after their arrival.

Huan was with Celegorm and [[Curufin]] who were hunting when he smelled [[Lúthien]] and captured and brought the maid before Celegorm. She had set out to rescue [[Beren]], who had gone with [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] to [[Angband]] but had been captured in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of [[Sauron]], and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, "for her own protection", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father [[Thingol]].

Huan felt pity for Lúthien, and sought her out and so he became involved with the [[Quest for the Silmaril]]. Speaking for the first time, he told her of a way to escape, and then accompanied her to [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] where, with the help of Lúthien's [[magic]], he killed all of Sauron's [[Werewolves]] until Sauron himself came out, taking the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to [[Doriath]]. They came across Celegorm and Curufin, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by [[Orodreth]] when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.

Speaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to gain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf [[Draugluin]] and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger [[Thuringwethil]]. Using these skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan hunted in the wild.

After Beren and Lúthien had won the [[Silmaril]] but Beren had lost his hand to the werewolf [[Carcharoth]], Huan joined Beren, Thingol, [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] and [[Mablung]] in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. Huan and Beren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded, as was Beren. Speaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien farewell, and died, with Beren's palm upon his head.

== Origin and nature ==

For some time Tolkien considered Huan as a dog-shaped Maia.<ref>{{MR|P5VIII}}. Note 4.</ref> Later, however, Tolkien decided that Huan is just a animal, despite being a "higher level" one.<ref name="MR409-11">{{MR|Myths}} pp. 409-11</ref> See [[Eagles#Origin_and_nature|Eagles: Origin and nature]] for more details.
