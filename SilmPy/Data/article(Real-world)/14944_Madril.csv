}}'''Madril''' was [[Faramir]]'s second in command in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]. He is played by [[John Bach]].

==History==
Madril was a Ranger of some experience. He helped [[Faramir]] in his ambush of [[Haradrim]] in [[Ithilien]], where they also captured [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. After a short stay at [[Henneth Annûn]], the company moved on to [[Osgiliath]] to reinforce its garrison.<ref>{{tttee}}</ref>

Despite initial doubts, the Orcs held off an attack. Madril sent scouts to [[Cair Andros]] to see if there was any enemy activity in the North. However, the Orcs crossed the [[Anduin]] in Osgiliath with boats, and Faramir's men were caught unawares.

The orcs overpowered the Gondorian troops, and at Madril's advice, Faramir called for a retreat. During the call, Madril was badly wounded. He was left behind in the evacuation. As he lay dying, [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] stabbed him with a spear, killing him outright.<ref>{{rotkee}}</ref>
