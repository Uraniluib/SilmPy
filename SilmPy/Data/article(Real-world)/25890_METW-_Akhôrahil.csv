==Card text==

'''''Unique.''''' Nazgûl (5th). May be played as a hazard creature (with one strike) or as a permanent event. As a creature, may also be played keyed to [[METW: Harondor|Harondor]], [[METW: Horse Plains|Horse Plains]], [[METW: Gorgoroth|Gorgoroth]], and [[METW: Khand|Khand]]; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Akhôrahil becomes a short-event and modifies any one character's body by -1 for the rest of this turn.
