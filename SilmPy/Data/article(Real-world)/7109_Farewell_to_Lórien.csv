'''Farewell to Lórien''' is the eighth chapter of the second book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
[[Galadriel]] gave the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company]] boats in order to float down the [[Anduin]]. She gave each of them a gift, in order to help them on their way. She gave [[Aragorn]] a sheath made to fit his sword and a silver broach that held a clear green stone, the [[Elfstone]] of the house of [[Elendil]]. To [[Boromir]], she gave a belt of gold. To [[Legolas]] she gave a bow strung with elf-hair and a quiver of arrows. To [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]], she gave silver [[Merry and Pippin's belts|belts]] with golden clasps. To Sam she gave neither something to keep him on the road nor to defend himself; instead she gave him a box of earth from her gardens, so that if he returned to his home in [[the Shire]], his garden would bloom like none other. When she asked [[Gimli]] what he wanted of her. After much modest refusal, he asked for a strand of her hair. She gave him three, as well as a blessing that his hands would ever flow with gold, though it would have no dominion over his mind. To [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] she bequeathed a small crystal vial in which was caught the light of [[Eärendil]]'s star, amid the waters of a fountain. It would be a light for him in dark places and make the night brighter.

The company then left on their way down the river. They had chosen a difficult, but a valiant path.
