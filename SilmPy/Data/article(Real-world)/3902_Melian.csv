'''Melian''' the [[Maia]] was the wife of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], mother of [[Lúthien]], and '''Queen of [[Doriath]]'''. 

== Attributes==
Melian served [[Vána]] and [[Estë]]. She was said to be akin to [[Yavanna]] the Valië. She is associated with songbirds, and it is said she taught nightingales how to sing. In [[Valinor]], she dwelt in the gardens of [[Lórien in Valinor|Lórien]] tending its trees; the song of [[nightingales]] followed her paces. However she journeyed often to [[Middle-earth]] for she loved the deep shadows of trees and forests.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref><ref>{{S|4}}</ref> 
==History==
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian.jpg|thumb|left|Elena Kukanova - ''Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian'']]
Back in the time of the [[Great March]] when the [[Eldar]] marched into the [[Aman|West]], in the woods of [[Nan Elmoth]], Melian came upon [[Elwë Singollo]] of the people of the [[Teleri]]. Elwe was entranced and fell into a swoon at the sight of the Maia Melian and the two of them stood hand in hand unable to move or speak for years while the trees grew around them. As a result of his absence, a portion of his followers stayed behind to search for him, while the rest continued on to [[Valinor]]. 

Melian and Thingol recovered and gathered the Elves who stayed behind to look for Elwe, who were named [[Eglath]]. They founded the kingdom of [[Eglador]] in and ruled as King and Queen of all the Elves in [[Beleriand]]. Melian was the only known [[Ainur|Ainu]] who coupled with one of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and she begot a child, [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]], who was the fairest of the Children to have ever lived. She married the Man [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], and as a result, Melian's Maian blood was passed on to both [[Elves]] and [[Men]].

Forseeing that war was coming to Beleriand, Melian warned her husband Thingol. In turn, Thingol ordered the delving of a strong fortress in their kingdom. This was [[Menegroth]], the Thousand Caves, and they were aided by the Dwarves. With the return of Morgoth and the flight of Ungoliant from his Balrogs, the dark spider tried to enter into Thingol's domain, but Melian alone repelled Ungoliant and drove her away.

When war with the Great Enemy, [[Morgoth]], came to their land, she used her powers to guard and defend it with a protection called ''List Melian'', or "the [[Girdle of Melian]]" and their kingdom was known as [[Doriath]], the Land of the Fence. This prevented anyone less powerful than Melian from entering the kingdom. However, with the foresight of a Maia, she predicted that one day someone more powerful would be able to enter. When Beren arrived as foretold, she counseled King Thingol against sending Beren to search for a [[Silmaril]], which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. This was one of many instances in which she proved, through her wisdom and powers of foresight, to be wiser than her husband, and an effective queen of her land. The great evil wolf [[Carcharoth]] also passed the Girdle, as the power of the Silmaril let him. 

In Doriath she also became a friend and tutor of [[Galadriel]] to whom she taught the art of [[lembas]]-baking which she knew from her mistress, Yavanna. She eventually questioned Galadriel on how and why the Noldor had returned, upon which Galadriel told her only some of the story. Therefore she was the first to gleam the truth, perceiving more than Galadriel was willing to tell, and she warned Thingol against dealing with the sons of Fëanor. After the departure of Lúthien and Beren, she aided Túrin and his mother and sister. She provided [[Beleg]] with some way-bread, [[lembas]], showing great favor because never before was lembas given to a Man and seldom was it again. But she also foresaw his doom in his quest for [[Túrin]]. When [[Húrin]] returned, she was the one to lift the spell of Morgoth from him.

Thingol's arrogance eventually resulted to his death in the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves]]. Melian then vanished from the mortal lands, passing to Valinor, where she mourned the loss of her husband in the [[Halls of Mandos]] and her daughter to the unknown fate of the [[Gift of Men]]. In her absence Doriath was opened to its enemies.

==Etymology==
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Melian.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
{{pronounce|Quenya - Melyanna.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
'''Melian''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈmeljan]}}) in [[Sindarin]] means ''Dear gift''. Her [[Quenya]] name was '''Melyanna''' (pron. {{IPA|[meˈʎanːa]}}; from ''mel,'' "love" and ''anna,'' "gift").<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''mel-''</ref> She was also called ''[[Tóril]]'' meaning "Queen".

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In the early [[legendarium]] Melian is defined as a fay, making her somewhat more sinister than in her later appearance. This version of her is presented in '''The Tale of Tinúviel''', Tolkien's first story of Beren and Lúthien, which was written in archaic english and published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. In this work she appears in another later narrative, although her character is portrayed as being far weaker and more frail than Melian's final manifestation. She also appeared under several names, such as '''Gwenniel'''.
