'''Aerlinn''' is [[Sindarin]] for 'holy song' or maybe 'sea song'. ([[aer]] = ocean, [[lin]] = song)

The aerlinn are Elven songs or hymns addressed to Elbereth, or more probably to all of the Valar. 

The exact meaning of the word is ambiguous: no word for 'holy' has been attested in Sindarin but it is believed that the equivalent of the [[Quenya]] word aira would be aer. On the other hand aer means 'sea'. In that case these songs express their longing for [[Valinor]] beyond the Sea.
