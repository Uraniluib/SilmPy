'''''The Inland Sea''''' was a supplement intended to be published for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''. Mike Campbell and Luke Potter were commissioned during the 1990s to write the supplement. But as the editor [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] lost the exploitation licence of ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' in September 1999, Campbell and Potter stopped working on the Inland Sea project around 1999/2000.

The manuscripts of MERP the Inland Sea (including several maps) were in the end published free of charge by Chris Seeman (from the fanzine Other Hands). They can be reached through the Yahoo Fan modules ftp site on Internet. The present state of these manuscripts is that of a playable supplement.
