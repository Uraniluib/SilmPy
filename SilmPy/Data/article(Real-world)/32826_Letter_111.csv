==Summary==
Tolkien stated that he had written a letter to Unwin on the last day of July<ref group="note">See [[Letter 109]]</ref> but had laid it aside since it seemed too much of a pother about his works.

He had mainly devoted his time to philology as he had a colleague from Liege with whom he had done research before the war and who stayed with him while they prepared their work for press.  He was about to spend a few days performing college business so he was sending the long-delayed letter.

In between research and journey he had tried to squeeze in revising Book II of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  He was sending this material under a separate cover for Rayner and Stanley to critique.  Some chapters had been rewritten so that there would be no repetition.  He also sent the preliminary chapter of the Forward:<ref group="note">Later to be the Prologue</ref> "Concerning Hobbits" which linked to the earlier book and answered questions that had been asked.
