<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The Grey Wizard, Maia [[Gandalf/Names|Olorin]]
Who has born in Timeless Halls 
From the first race of Iluvatar 
Spirit older than the world itself 

Humble servant of valar 
Lived in gardens of [[LÃ³rien (Valinor)|Lorien]] 
Higher being turned to flesh and blood 
One of the Five Wizards 
Came to help the people of Arda 
To raise light over Sauron's might 

[[Gandalf/Names|Mithrandir]], one of the august 
The Grey Wizard beyond the sea 
Chosen to carry his knowledge 
For the mortal world so weak 
Great shape of the spirit eternal 
Fought thousands of years for peace 
His way to defeat the darkness 
His work, written in history 

[[Gandalf]] the old wizard 
Pilgrim from Undying Lands 
Great were his journeys in Arda 
Journeys against all evil 
Death of Smaug the Dragon 
Fellowship of the Ring 
Slayer of Moria's demon 
True gift from the halls of gods 

After the duel in dwarven caves 
The Grey Wizard rose again 
In a colours of radiant white 
Now it's his time to ride 
To the final fields of glory
