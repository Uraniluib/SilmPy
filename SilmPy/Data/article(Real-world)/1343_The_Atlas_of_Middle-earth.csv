'''''The Atlas of Middle-earth''''' by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] is an atlas of various lands in [[Arda]]. It includes specific maps for ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', for which it is intended as a reading companion.

==Contents==
The maps are treated as if they are of real landscapes, and are drawn according to the same rules that a real atlas is drawn: for each area the history of the land is taken into account, as well as geography on a larger scale and from there maps are drawn. Discussion includes suggestions as to the geology that could explain various formations, and points that are contradictory between multiple accounts.

City maps and floor plans for important buildings are also included; these are very often useful for making sense of the narratives, especially in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  As well, many battles such as [[Battles of Beleriand|those]] of [[Beleriand]], the [[Last Alliance]] and the [[War of the Ring]] are illustrated.

The book was published in [[1981]], but in [[1991]] a revised and updated version was published, which took information from ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' into account.

Fonstad also made a bold attempt to fill the gaps by using early conceptual work, mainly from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' and the ''[[Ambarkanta]]'', combining the later known maps with the sketches used by Tolkien to provide "world maps" of [[Arda]] in its entirity and show [[Aman]], [[Beleriand]]'s position relative to [[Eriador]], and the place of [[Númenor]] in the Sea.

It was, however, published before the final three volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' were published, and thus some maps are based on [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early works, which were revised in later writings.

==Errors and criticism==
Despite being a thorough and well-respected reference book, the ''Atlas'' has been known for several mistakes. However, a number of these were corrected in the revised edition, as noted below.
*Page 2: [[Sea of Ringil]] is written as "Ringol"
*Page 4 and 5: The mountain range which appears in the western area of [[Haradwaith]] south of the [[Great Gulf]] is labelled as the "[[Grey Mountains (ancient)|Grey Mountains]]". However, it is said in ''[[Ambarkanta|The Ambarkanta]]'' that the Grey Mountains were located in the [[Dark Land|Southlands]], another name for the Dark Land.<ref>{{SM|5b}} p. 239</ref>
*Page 7: [[Ezellohar]] is written as "Ezollahar"
*Page 13: [[Gabilgathol]] is once written as "Gabilgathod".
:*Belegost and Nogrod seem to have switched positions: ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' mentions that Nogrod was the southern one. Also, Tolkien mentions that Galbigathol was "north of the great height of Mount Dolmed" while Fonstad has both of them south. This change was made in accordance with [[The History of Middle-earth]] volume IV, [[The Shaping of Middle-earth]].
*Page 12 and page 53: [[Dorthonion]] and [[Himring]] are located slightly above parallel J. However much later, [[Tol Fuin]] and [[Himling]] are seen much northern, above parallel I.
*Page 38 and page 41: [[Belegost]] has been moved 150 miles further south than previously shown to the middle of the southern [[Blue Mountains]].
*Pages 39 and 88: [[Drúwaith Iaur]] is shown north of the [[Ered Nimrais]] and south of the [[Angren]], and on page 39 extending east below the [[Adorn]].  In the Unfinished Tales map Drúwaith Iaur is in the narrow area between the ocean and the southern Ered Nimrais, south of the mouth of the [[Angren]].<ref>{{UT|Index}}, "Map"</ref>
*Pages 53, 76, and 80: On page 53, [[Rhosgobel]] is located near the border of [[Mirkwood]] well ''south'' of the [[Old Forest Road]], due east of [[Moria]]. On pages 76 and 80, Rhosgobel is still at the edge of the forest, but ''north'' of the Old Forest Road.  One or the other location should have been used, not both.
:*Note: In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', during the month of December, [[TA|3019]], it is mentioned that scouts "had climbed the pass at the source of the [[Gladden River]], and had come down into  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] and over the [[Gladden Fields]] and so at length had reached the old home of [[Radagast]] at Rhosgobel" which would seem to support the page 53 location.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>  However, in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] said that Rhosgobel was "in the forest borders between the [[Carrock]] and the Old Forest Road".<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 4</ref>
*Page 71: [[Tuckborough]] is written "Tuckburrow".
*Page 92 and 93: The location of [[Lithlad]] is given as being in the south of [[Mordor]], rather than the northeast.
*Page 99: Bilbo gave the Arkenstone to the Elvenking and Bard on ''22 November'', then Dáin arrived in the early morning on ''23 November''.  In ''The Hobbit'', [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] gave away the [[Arkenstone]] and then returned ''before midnight'' to wake up Bombur.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref>  The next day there was a new parley, it was revealed that the elves and the men had the Arkenstone, and [[Thorin|Thorin]] expelled Bilbo from the [[Lonely Mountain]].  On the ''next'' morning Dáin arrived.<ref name="Burst">{{H|Burst}}</ref>  Fonstad had Dáin arriving in one day, the text of ''The Hobbit'' had him arriving in two days.
*Page 106: In ''The Hobbit'', the dwarves saw a fire off in the woods.  "The light was ahead of them and to the ''left'' of the path".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>  In Fonstad's map the dwarves left the path to the right. (Corrected.)
*Page 113: The leader of the goblins is named "Borg".  It should be [[Bolg]],<ref name="Burst"/> which is twice printed correctly on the preceding page. (Corrected.)
*Page 125: The map of [[Bree]] and the surrounding towns, [[Combe]] is shown laying to the northwest of [[Staddle]] on the east side of the [[Bree-hill]], while in fact Combe should lie a little east of Staddle's location.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
*Page 135: In the map of [[Orthanc]], the last peak is named "Mathedras" instead of "[[Methedras]]".
*Page 148: [[Gamling|Gamling the Old]] is called "Gambling the Old".
*Page 189: The language of the [[Dwarves]] is labeled "[[Khazâd]]" instead of [[Khuzdul]].

The usage of early concepts of the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' alongside the established [[canon]], are also arguably controversial. In [[Aman]], Fonstad identified the early name "[[Hanstovánen]]" and also she points out the dwellings of the [[Valar]] in [[Valinor]]. The same happens with [[Tol Eressëa]] whose (tentative) maps portray [[Tavrobel]] and [[Kortirion]] as well as some places in [[Gondolin]].

==Post-publication Canon== 
Since the ''Atlas'' was published before the publication of the final three volumes of ''The History of Middle-earth'' and did not take Tolkien's [[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|letters]] into account, her maps bear some contradictions to later established canon concerning Middle-earth's geography.
*Page viii: [[Middle-earth]] dominates much of the northern hemisphere of [[Arda]] [[Changing of the World|made round]], with [[Forochel]] being high in the polar regions of the world and [[Umbar]] laying more than halfway southward between the northern pole and the [[Girdle of Arda|equator]].
**In [[Letter 294]], Tolkien confirms that [[Hobbiton]] is intended to be at the latitude of [[wikipedia:Oxford|Oxford]], with [[Minas Tirith]] 600 miles south being near to the latitude of [[wikipedia:Florence|Florence]]. With this information, it is clear that Middle-earth would be hardly as large as it appears on the ''Atlas'' map of a round Arda.
*Pages 4 - 5: The [[Sea of Helcar]] is seen to cover the area of future [[Mordor]], [[Khand]], and [[Rhûn]], and the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and [[Sea of Núrnen]] are shown as its remnants. The [[Orocarni]] in the East are approximately 800 to 1700 miles away from the [[Misty Mountains]].
**In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', there are references to the Sea of Rhûn existing in the [[First Age]], as well as the forest to its northeast and the hills to its southwest, indicating that it must be separate from the Sea of Helcar.
** ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'' also indicates that the distance between the Orocarni in the East and the Misty Mountains, specifically [[Gundabad]], was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance to the [[Blue Mountains]] in the West.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>
*Pages 38 - 39: The western shores of [[Lindon]] and the [[Ethir Anduin]] are shown to exist in the [[Second Age]] of the world as they did in the [[Third Age]].
**''The Peoples of Middle-earth'' tells that during the [[Akallabêth|Downfall of Númenor]], Lindon lost much land to the advancing shores, while the eastern and southern portions of the [[Bay of Belfalas]] retreated back, putting the city of [[Pelargir]], which had been only a few miles from the coast, much farther inland.
