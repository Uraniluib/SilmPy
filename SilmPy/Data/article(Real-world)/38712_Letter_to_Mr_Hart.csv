{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Hart,<br/><br/>I find myself unexpectedly able to come to Cambridge this Saturday. I am being driven over by the Warden of Merton, who will be going back on the Sunday, but I shall not myself be obliged to return until some time on Monday. As far as I can see I shall be unoccupied on Sunday. It is very short notice but I wondered if this might be of any interest to you. I have written to Mr. Dufton in the same terms.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}
