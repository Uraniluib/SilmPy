An extract was published in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition]]'' on page 210; in it, Tolkien mentions why he used [[spiders]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

==Extract ==
"I put in the spiders largely because this was, you remember, primarily written for my children (at least I had them in mind), and one of my sons in particular dislikes spiders with a great intensity. I did it to thoroughly frighten him and it did!"
