'''Haradrim''' is a defunct [[Tolkien Societies|Tolkien Society]] for speakers of [[wikipedia:Afrikaans|Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]. The society was founded in 2000.

==History==
Haradrim was instrumental in locating the former location of the Bank of Africa ([[Arthur Tolkien]]'s offices), Arthur Tolkien's grave site (where a new tombstone as well as a tree were planted/placed)<ref>http://kloofstreet.blogspot.com/2008/03/one-with-photo-of-tolkiens-fathers.html (accessed 05-12-2011)</ref> as well as finding Arthur Tolkien's last will and other documents. Haradrim also hosted members of the Tolkien family on occasion. In the 1990s and early 2000s Haradrim organized radio shows and lectures as well as exhibitions around J.R.R. Tolkien.

The vast distances in South Africa between its large cities (Johannesburg/Pretoria - Bloemfontein - Cape Town - Durban), emigration due to [[wikipedia:Afrikaner#Afrikaner_diaspora_and_emigration|crime and affirmative action]] as well as cultural and language barriers and the limited interest in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] by the general public all contributed to the demise of this society.{{fact}}
