{{lolcantos}}
This first [[Cantos of the Lay of the Leithian|Canto]] of the [[Lay of Leithian]] tells of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], and [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] and [[Doriath]]. It runs to 98 lines, the shortest canto save the last, unfinished one.

== Concerning the Canto ==
This canto starts out with one of the more popular paragraphs, concerning Thingol.

<blockquote> ''A king there was in days of old: / ere [[Men]] yet walked upon the mould. . .''</blockquote>

The descriptions of jewels is contrasted with the love of his daughter, whose description soon follows.

<blockquote> ''There beryl, pearl, and opal pale / and metal wrought like fishes' mail. . . / all these he had and loved them less / than a maiden once in Elfinesse; / for fairer than are born to Men / a daughter had he, Lúthien''</blockquote>

Then it introduces [[Endor]] and orients the reader.

<blockquote> ''To North there lay the Land of Dread / whence only evil pathways led. . . / to South the wide earth unexplored / to West the ancient [[Belegaer|Ocean]] roared, / unsailed and shoreless, wide and wild / to East in peaks of blue were piled. . .'' </blockquote>

Note the reference below to fairies, not uncommon in older works.  One thing about the Lay is that it commonly connects Beleriand and Faërie.

<blockquote>''[[Esgalduin]] that fairies call / in many a tall and torchlit hall''</blockquote>

Note also that the name of '''Dairon''' is spelt here with an "i", as opposed to '''[[Daeron]]''' of later works.

<blockquote> ''When leaves were long and grass was green / then Dairon with his fingers lean, /as daylight melted into shade, / a wandering music sweetly made. . .''</blockquote>

It ends on a note of change, signifying the end of the introduction and the beginning of the tale.

<blockquote> ''. . . until a day beneath the [[sun]], / when many marvels were begun.'' </blockquote>
