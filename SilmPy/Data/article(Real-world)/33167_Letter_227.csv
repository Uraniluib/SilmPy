==Summary==
[[Númenor]], shortened from ''[[Númenórë]]'', was his own invention, said Tolkien.  It was a compound of ''numē-n'', "going down" (NDŪ, NU), sunset, West, and ''nórë'' "land, country".  The legends of ''Númenórë'' were background for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  They were his own version of the ''Atlantis'' legend, not based on special ''knowledge'' but with the tradition of culture-bearing men from the Sea.

Tolkien said that [[C.S. Lewis]] was a very old friend and that it was his encouragement that induced him to eventually finish ''The Lord of the Rings''.  He had heard all of it read aloud but never saw it in print until after his trilogy was published.  His ''Numinor'' was derived by ear from Tolkien's name.

He was under contract, said Tolkien, to prepare for publication the mythology and stories from the [[First Age|First]] and [[Second Age|Second]] Ages.  It had not been deemed publishable until the surprising success of ''The Lord of the Rings''.  However, ''The Silmarillion'' had no hobbits, little fun or earthiness, but much grief and disaster.  It ought to satisfy the critics who claimed, falsely, that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' "everyone was happy ever after" – if they deigned to notice it.
