'''Thorondor''', the '''[[Lord of the Eagles]]''', was the greatest of the [[Eagles]] of [[Manwë]] king of the [[Valar]]. It is said that Thorondor had a wingspan of thirty [[Wikipedia:Fathom|fathoms]].<ref>{{SM|Q8}}, pp. 102-3 (also p. 173)</ref>
==History==
Thorondor was sent by Manwë to watch over the [[Noldor]] after they arrived in [[Beleriand]]. The [[Eldar]] first encountered him when he helped [[Fingon]] rescue [[Maedhros]] from imprisonment from [[Thangorodrim]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> 

After that, Thorondor and the rest of the Eagles settled in the [[Crissaegrim]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> When [[Gondolin]] was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued [[Fingolfin]]'s body from defilement after [[Morgoth]] killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> 

He and two of his vassals, [[Gwaihir]] and [[Landroval]],<ref name=P1>{{WJ|P1}} p. 68</ref> rescued [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] when [[Angband]] was aroused.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> When Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> 

During the [[War of Wrath]], Thorondor and [[Eärendil]] led the Eagles in battle with the [[Dragons]], and may have fought with [[Ancalagon]] the Black.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> 

Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath,<ref group=note>[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have suggested that Thorondor perhaps returned to [[Valinor]]. Cf [http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=181775 Thorondor] at [http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum.php LotRPlaza.com].</ref> but his descendants played part in some events of the [[Third Age]].

In earlier versions of the legendarium he was called '''Thorndor''' and '''Throndor''' ([[Gnomish]]), containing the roots ''thorn'' "eagle" or ''thrond'' "pinnacle",<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}} p. 266 (see Sorontur)</ref> and '''Thorntor''' ([[Ilkorin]]).
