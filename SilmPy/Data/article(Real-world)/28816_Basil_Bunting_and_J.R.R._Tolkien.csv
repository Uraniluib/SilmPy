==Official description==

On Side 1 is a rare interview, recorded in 1964, with J. R. R. Tolkien and Denis Gueroult about his imaginary world of "Middle Earth" and the languages he created for his characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Inventing languages was one of his childhood pastimes, while in his academic life at Oxford he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon and later of English Language and Literature. Tolkien's personality and his views on man, society and politics come across clearly in this illuminating conversation.
