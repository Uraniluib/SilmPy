'''Barbara Strachey''' ([[17 July|July 17]], [[1912]] - [[15 October|October 15]], [[1999]]) was a writer, broadcaster and photographer. 

The [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-schooled Strachey worked for the [[BBC]], and later wrote among other works ''[[Journeys of Frodo]]''. This collection of maps does not share the widespread fame of [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', but is of similar quality.
