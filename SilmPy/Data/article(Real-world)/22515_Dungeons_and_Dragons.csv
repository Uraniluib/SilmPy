'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' is a popular fantasy role playing game. It is not directly related to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works but the hit role playing game borrowed heavily from the world of [[Arda]]. Some of this was used as an advertising trick. Due to copyright violation, some of the names were changed: 

* ''[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]'' to "[[halflings|halfling]]"
* ''[[Ents|Ent]]'' to "treant" 
* ''[[Balrogs|Balrog]]'' to "Type VI demon [balor]"

Others, like [[Elves]], [[Half-elven|Half-elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Dragons]], were so common, and not necessarily Tolkien's, that they still stand.
