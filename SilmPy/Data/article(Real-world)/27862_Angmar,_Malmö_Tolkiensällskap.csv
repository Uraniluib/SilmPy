'''Angmar, Malmö Tolkiensällskap''', is the Swedish Tolkien Society of [[wikipedia:Malmö|Malmö]], hived off from [[Forodrim]]. The association published the magazine ''Certhas Angmar'' (a publication which, as of 2010, seems to have ceased to exist).

Angmar is composed of seven guilds: a Language Guild, an Equipment/Decoration Guild (hard to translate; "Rustgillet"), a Gaming Guild, an Elf-guild, a Food-and-Wine Guild, a Bow Guild, and a Dance Guild.
