'''Guillermo del Toro''' ([[9 October|October 9]], [[1964]]) is an Academy Award-nominated Mexican director. He was originally set to direct ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit (film series)]]'', but dropped out after legal matters delayed the shoot. He remains as one of the writers, though.

Del Toro is known for his imaginative visuals; his major works include comic-book adaptations ''Blade II'' and ''Hellboy'', and the critically acclaimed ''El Laberinto del Fauno'' (Spanish, lit. The Labyrinth of the Faun. Released in English-speaking countries as ''Pan's Labyrinth'').

Although he has stated he 'loved' The Hobbit, Del Toro's lack of knowledge about Tolkien's works has already worried some fans:
: ''"I tried my best to read [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]] [sic], the trilogy. I could not. I could not. They were very dense. And then one day, I bought The Hobbit. I read it and I loved it."''[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/12/will-guillermo.html]

:When asked to what extent has the work of Tolkien influenced him:
{{quote|Not at all. I could barely finish "The Hobbit". Curiously, that kind of fantasy, never called out to me. I think that fairy tales are in themselves a different genre. Heroic fantasy, in general, leaves me cold. I am more interested in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s work of terror than his novels about the muscular Conan. Although there are two writers of fantasy that I think are sublime: Clark Ashton Smith and Lord Dunsany.

{{quote|I was never into heroic fantasy. At all. I don't like little guys and dragons, hairy feet, hobbits -- I've never been into that at all. I don't like sword and sorcery, I hate all that stuff.|Salon.com, October 2006 (Interview from May) [http://www.salon.com/ent/audiofile/2006/10/12/conversations_toro/]}}
