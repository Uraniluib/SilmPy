{{Pronounce|Haleth.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Lady Haleth''' ({{FA|341}} â€“ {{FA|420}}, aged 79 years) was the daughter of [[Haldad]] and twin sister of [[Haldar]]. In time she became leader of the [[Haladin]], one of the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]].

==History==
In {{FA|375}}, the Haladin crossed the [[Blue Mountains]], the second group of [[Men]] to do so. They settled in [[Thargelion]], the land of the [[Noldor|Elf]] Lord [[Caranthir]]. Though they dwelled in Caranthir's land, they did not swear allegiance to him and remained freemen. After her father and her twin brother were slain in an [[Orcs|Orc]] raid, Haleth became [[Chieftain of the Haladin]]. She kept her people alive for seven days while the Orcs laid siege to the encampment, until Caranthir finally arrived with reinforcements. Impressed with her bravery, he offered her a fiefdom in his land and the protection of his soldiers. Haleth, however, was proud and refused his offer.

Haleth instead led her people to the relative safety of the [[Forest of Brethil]] in the lands of King [[Thingol]]. In exchange for defending the [[Crossing of Teiglin|Crossing of the Teiglin River]], King [[Finrod]] made use of his friendship with Thingol to allow the Haladin to remain freemen. Years later, when Haleth died, her people raised a monument to her, the ''[[Haudh-en-Arwen]]''. While her father had been elected Chief of his people, the Haladin chose to establish a ruling line from the descendants of Haldad. Because Haleth did not marry and had no children, her brother's son [[Haldan]] became Chieftain of the Haladin.

The Haladin remained in the Forest of Brethil for the duration of the First Age, and in time were known as the '''[[House of Haleth]]'''.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Haleth has no known meaning. In the language of the Haladin, [[hal]] means "chief" or "guard". [[Sindarin]] also has the feminine ending -eth.
