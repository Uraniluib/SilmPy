'''''A Tolkienian Mathomium''''' is a book by [[Mark T. Hooker]], illustrated by [[James Dunning]].
==From the Publisher==
This monograph is a collection of analytic articles--both previously published and unpublished in about equal measure - on [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', written by Tolkien scholar and Comparative Translationist [[Mark T. Hooker]], most famous, perhaps, for his application of Comparative Translation to the study of Tolkien. All of the articles in the book have been reviewed and revised to take into consideration the materials newly made available in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]''. 

==Reviews==
<!--Needs Journal numbers, reviewers. These are anonymous authorities-->
* [[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]] (the September 2006 issue) says: "Highly recommendable."
* [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 4]] ran with a review saying it was a "pleasantly eccentric volume" . . . "Hooker has a wide variety of things to say that have not been heard before." 
* [[Lembas (journal)|Lembas]] (No. 130, August 2007) says: "All in all, certainly a book that's worth the effort of taking the time to go through peacefully. For linguists--language nuts or not--and also for others, certainly one of the better products of [Tolkien] fandom."
