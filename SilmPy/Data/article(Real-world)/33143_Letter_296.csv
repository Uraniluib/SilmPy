==Summary==
Tolkien thanked Rayner for his recent kindness looking after him and his affairs.  He called himself singularly fortunate to have such a friend, comparing their relations to that of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]].  For his part, said Tolkien, the [[Oath of Eorl]] would never be broken and he would continue to rely on the wisdom and courtesy of [[Minas Tirith in Gondor|Minas Tirith]].
