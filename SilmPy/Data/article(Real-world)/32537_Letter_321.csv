==Summary==
Tolkien writes that he was most pleased by Rorke's reference to the description of the "glittering caves", which no other critic had picked out for special mention.  Tolkien said he based them on the caves in [[Wikipedia:Cheddar Gorge|Cheddar Gorge]].  He had revisited them in 1940 but his main memory was from a visit during his honeymoon.
