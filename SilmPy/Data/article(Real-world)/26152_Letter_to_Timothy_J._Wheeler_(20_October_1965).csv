{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Wheeler,<br/><br/>Thank you for your interest and support. Ballantine Books is about to bring out a paper-back edition revised by myself. This should make it worth the few cents difference in price, of which I shall receive about one third.<br/><br/>With kind regards,<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>JRR Tolkien<br/><br/>P.S. It must be noted that Ace Books are acting legally, whether morally or not, and purchasers of their edition have no claim in law to a return of money.}}
