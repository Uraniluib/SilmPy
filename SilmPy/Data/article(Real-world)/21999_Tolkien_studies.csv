'''Tolkien studies''' is the scholarly research of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] this includes his fictional literature and languages and his philologist research.

==History==

===Tolkien's Scholarship===
Tolkien's own academic research has had a great impact within the field of philology. 

Tolkien wrote many of the entries under "W" in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and many of those entries still survive this day as he originally wrote them.<ref>[[Peter Gilliver]], [[Jeremy Marshall]], [[Edmund Weiner]], ''[[The Ring of Words]]''</ref>
He also wrote the groundbreaking ''[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]'' which looked at common words instead of exotic words.<ref>Margaret L. Lee, "Middle English", published in ''[[The Year's Work in English Studies]]'', vol II (1922), pages 41-53, esp. 42-3</ref>  

His lecture titled ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' changed scholars understanding of the epic poem. During his time it was largely viewed as a historical document, but Tolkien argued that it should be examined as a literay work of art. This method of studying Beowulf is now popular today.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'', "Introduction"</ref>

===Age of Innocence===
Generally, the history of Tolkien scholarship is divided into four time periods: 
* the book reviews
* the cult period and the fierce reactions to it
* the acceptance of Tolkien as a literary agent
* and lastly, the post-[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|movie]] phase, featuring expanded volumes, reprints, and a wide variety of subjects.<ref name="ScholOverview">[[Brian Rosebury]], "Tolkien Scholarship: An Overview", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pages 653-654</ref> 

The first two periods have been summarized by [[Tom Shippey]] as the "Age of Innocence": the time before the publishing of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. After the publishing of at least some of those, many musings, theories and guesses were flattened by additional information.<ref name="CompFore">[[Tom Shippey]], "Foreword" published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (third edition) (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), pages vii-xi</ref> The field of literary critics taking interest was still thin, and serious academic research was rare. The first conference on Tolkien's literature was held in [[1966]]; before that, only collected works on children's literature had picked up serious attention for ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name="ScholFirst">[[Richard C. West]], "Tolkien Scholarship: First Decades: 1954-1980", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pages 654-656</ref>

===1,800 New Entries===
A major turn in scholarship was the publishing of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The book included the history of things that were previously no more than a "background-word", such as [[Beren]]<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[A Knife in the Dark]]"</ref> or [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{HM|H}}, "[[A Short Rest]]"</ref> Apart from many expanded entries, the second edition of [[J.E.A. Tyler]]'s ''[[The Tolkien Companion]]'' included some 1,800 new entries.<ref>[[Colin Duriez]], ''[[Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings]]'', page 47</ref> A landmark publication of this time was Shippey's ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]''.<ref name="ScholOverview"/>
