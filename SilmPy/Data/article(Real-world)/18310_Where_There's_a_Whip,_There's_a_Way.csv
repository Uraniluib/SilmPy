'''Where There's a Whip, There's a Way''' is a song, written by [[Glenn Yarbrough]] for the [[1980]] [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|animated movie ''The Return of the King'']]. It is considered camp by some, though not as campy as ''[[The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins]]'' by [[Leonard Nimoy]]. The title is a pun on the proverb "Where there's a will, there's a way" and the orc-driver's comment "Where there's a whip, there's a will"<ref>{{RK|Shadow}}</ref>. The tune and tone are very similar to ''[[Down, Down, To Goblin Town]]'', which had appeared in [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]. 

The song is sung during the trip [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] make through [[Mordor]].

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Where there's a whip, there's a way.
Where there's a whip, there's a way.
Where there's a whip...''[continues in second voice]''

We don't wanna go to war today
But the Lord of the Lash says: "nay, nay, nay!"
We're gonna march all day, all day, all day!
Where there's a whip there's a way!

Where there's a whip, there's a way!
Where there's a whip, there's a way!
Where there's a whip, there's a way!
Left, right, left, right, left
Where there's a whip, there's a way!
Left, right

The crack on the back says we're gonna fight
We're gonna march all day and night and more
For we are the slaves of the Dark Lord's war.
Left, right, left, right, left, right

Where there's a whip, there's a way!
Where there's a whip, there's a way.
Where there's a whip...''[continues in second voice]''

We don't wanna go to war today!
But the Lord of the Lash says: "nay, nay, nay!"
We're gonna march all day, all day, all day!
Where there's a whip there's a way!
Left, right, left right!

''[scene of Frodo and Sam]''

Where there's a whip!
We don't wanna go to war today!
But the Lord of the Lash says: "nay, nay, nay!"
We're gonna march all day, all day, all day!
Where there's a whip there's a way!
