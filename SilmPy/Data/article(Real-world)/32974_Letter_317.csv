==Summary==
Tolkien thanked Ronald for her gift.  He felt like a wise man who stored the most useful and necessary things in his craft for a long voyage.  He felt like his house was a ship and it looked like one, contented but surprised to have been dumped where it was by a wave.

He had not bought any good brandy but he had burgundy, port, sherry, some liqueurs, and one bottle of champagne (for Christmas).  He noted that the port was not vintage.  He liked port as a mid-morning drink; it was not for after a full meal and above all not for desert.
