The '''Song of Nimrodel''' is a song sung by [[Legolas]] while he and the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company]] rested by the river [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]] on the night of [[15 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> The original song was in [[Sindarin]] but Legolas sang the song in the [[Westron]] speech. The song is incomplete because Legolas had forgotten much of it. The song was long and sad, for it told how sorrow came upon [[Lothlórien]] when the [[Dwarves]] found [[Durin's Bane|evil in the mountains]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref> The song goes as follows:

:''An Elven-maid there was of old,<br>  A shining star by day:<br>Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,<br>  Her shoes of silver-grey.<br><br>A star was bound upon her brows,<br>  A light was on her hair<br>As sun upon the golden boughs<br>  In Lórien the fair.<br><br>Her hair was long, her limbs were white,<br>  And fair she was and free;<br>And in the wind she went as light<br>  As leaf of linden-tree.<br><br>Beside the falls of Nimrodel,<br>  By water clear and cool,<br>Her voice as falling silver fell<br>  Into the shining pool.<br><br>Where now she wanders none can tell,<br>  In sunlight or in shade;<br>For lost of yore was Nimrodel<br>  And in the mountains strayed.<br><br>The elven-ship in haven grey<br>  Beneath the mountain-lee<br>Awaited her for many a day<br>  Beside the roaring sea.<br><br>A wind by night in Northern lands<br>  Arose,and loud it cried,<br>And drove the ship from elven-strands<br>  Across the streaming tide.<br><br>When dawn came dim the land was lost,<br>  The mountains sinking grey <br>Beyond the heaving waves that tossed<br>  Their plumes of blinding spray.<br><br>Amroth beheld the fading shore<br>  Now low beyond the swell,<br>And cursed the faithless ship that bore<br>  Him far from Nimrodel.<br><br>Of old he was an Elven-king,<br>  A lord of tree and glen,<br>When golden were the boughs in spring<br>  In fair Lothlórien.<br><br>From helm to sea they saw him leap,<br>  As arrow from the string,<br>And dive into the water deep,<br>  As mew upon the wing.<br><br>The wind was in his flowing hair,<br>  The foam about him shone;<br>Afar they saw him strong and fair<br>  Go riding like a swan.<br><br>But from the West has come no word,<br>  And on the Hither Shore<br>No tidings Elven-folk have heard<br>  Of Amroth evermore.''<br>
