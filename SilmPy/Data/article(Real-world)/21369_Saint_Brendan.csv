'''Saint Brendan''' was an Irish monk who made a legendary journey to the western sea and found utopian lands. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was aware of this legend and made references to it.

The concept of [[Aman]] as the Paradise in the West, and the voyage of [[Ã†lfwine]], are inspired from the tale of St. Brendan. Tolkien even wrote a poem ''[[Imram]]'' about him.

Brendan's voyage is referenced again in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' as well as the search for the West.
