'''Finnish''' is a Scandinavian language, and one of the few non-Indoeuropean languages spoken in Europe.

The phonotactics of the Finnish language excited [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] which he likened to "bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before" that "quite intoxicated" him.<ref>{{L|163}}</ref>

It became was the inspiration for the [[Elvish]] language which Tolkien named [[Qenya]] (later [[Quenya]]), a language designed to emulate the beauty evoked by Finnish. Other than in the field of phonotactics, a small part of the Quenya vocabulary was probably directly inspired by Finnish words, cf. Q. ''[[lapse]]'' "baby", perhaps from F. ''[[Wiktionary:lapsi#Finnish|lapsi]]'' "child".
