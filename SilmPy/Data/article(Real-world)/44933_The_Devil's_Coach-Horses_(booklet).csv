'''''The Devil's Coach-Horses''''' is a separate printing of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s essay "[[The Devil's Coach-Horses]]" as a six-page pamphlet. It was published under the imprint "Jersey: Edward Brothers, 1925" (likely an unauthorised reprint). Although dated 1925 the text is printed in Monotype Bembo, a typeface cut in 1929. Therefore it can be assumed that this publication dates from after this time, possibly from the 1980s.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[J.R.R.
