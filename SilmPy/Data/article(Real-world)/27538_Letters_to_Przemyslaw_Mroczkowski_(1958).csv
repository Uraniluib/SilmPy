[Description and excerpt:] "In 1958 [Tolkien] broaches a 'difficult matter', offering his friend financial support, in the form of £30, writing a few days later to express his pleasure that 'you will allow me to share a little of the proceeds of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Specially since I guess it to be an answer to prayer, for on the way from church on Sunday I had a sudden clear intuition that you were worried and in difficulties'."<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?pos=7&intObjectID=5210972&sid= Christies.com], retrieved June 27, 2010</ref>
