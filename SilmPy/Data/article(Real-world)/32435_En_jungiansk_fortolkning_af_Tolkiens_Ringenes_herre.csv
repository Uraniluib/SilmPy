'''''En jungiansk fortolkning af Tolkiens Ringenes herre''''' ("A Jungian Interpretation of Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''") is a Danish-language book which explores ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the light of the psychological theories of [[Wikipedia:Carl Jung|Carl Jung]].

==From the publisher/author==

[''A Jungian Interpretation of Tolkien's'' The Lord of the Rings] takes the reader on a journey through Middle-earth, a journey that is also an inner journey which transforms both Hobbits and the characters they encounter along the route.

The book conveys an understanding of the deep, symbolic layers that are the source of the delight that many experience when reading ''The Lord of the Rings''. Jung's theory of archetypes provides a key to understanding the imaginative forces that are so powerful in Tolkien's masterpiece - and through an understanding of ourselves and our surroundings.<ref>[http://www.piaskogemann.dk/sider/tolkien.htm En jungiansk fortolkning af Tolkiens Ringenes herre] at [http://www.piaskogemann.dk/index.htm PiaSkogemann.dk] (accessed 4 April 2011)</ref>
