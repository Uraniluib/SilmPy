==Summary==
Tolkien noted that the Houghton Mifflin Co. had sent him proofs for ''Tree and Leaf'', with a block picture of a tree that was a mix between a fat sea-anemone and a pollarded Spanish chestnut, plastered with indecently ugly lettering.  It had been expensive for him to return it to them for their deadline and that had contributed to a certain acerbity in his comments to them.<ref group="note">For his letter to Houghton Mifflin, see [[Letter 263]].</ref>
