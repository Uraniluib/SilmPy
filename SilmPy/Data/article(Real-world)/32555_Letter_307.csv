==Summary==
On this day Tolkien saw a man coming to the back door with a box and he told his wife he would deal with it.  The cheery deliveryman presented him with 4 Ports and 3 Sherries, calling it "a nice present from somebody."  Tolkien said it was a nice present and not just from Somebody but from youbody (he called this a nice singular which hobbits must have used, with the plural "youbodies").  Very delightful and, being from Miss Ronald, well-timed.  The Tolkiens were snug in their new home, having mastered the unfamiliar central heating, but nights and days grew chill.  Port and sherry were great warmers.

"''Elde is me istolen on…ich am eldre than i was a winter and ek a lore''" quoth Tolkien.<ref group="note">"Old age has stolen upon me…I am older than I was both in winters (i.e. years) and in learning (i.e. wisdom)."</ref>  He hoped but doubted that he was wiser.
