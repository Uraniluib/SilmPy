Plunge into the soul of Lewis's ''Space Trilogy'', L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'', and Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''. Dwarves, elves, princes and princesses, dark powers, unlikely heros, and fantastic places open up to us in this excellent introduction to Christian mythopoeia.

"''Christian Mythmakers is a must for anyone wanting to explore the enchanted region of mythopoeia. A comfortable read, the book is packed with illuminating insights into the interplay of faith and imagination.''"  —Thomas Peters, author of ''Simply C.S. Lewis and Battling for the Modern Mind: A Beginner's Chesterton''

"''Making and experiencing myth are universal human realities. Hein, ever aware of this fact, leads us on a tour of Christian mythmaking from Bunyan to Wangerin. An enlightening, refreshing, and motivating work.''"  —J. I. Packer, professor of Theology, Regent College and author of ''Knowing God''

"''For Hein's perception of myth as a window upon the eternal, for the importance he gives to the enjoyment of story, and for the link he sees between imagination and divine creative power, we are grateful. His illuminating comments on the authors is sure to stir a renewed eagerness to read their works again.''" —Barbara Reynolds, biographer and translator of Dante's ''Purgatorio''

ROLLAND HEIN is professor emeritus of English at Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois. He is author of several books about George MacDonald, most notably ''George MacDonald: Victorian Mythmaker''. Dr. Hein lives in St. Charles, Illinois.
