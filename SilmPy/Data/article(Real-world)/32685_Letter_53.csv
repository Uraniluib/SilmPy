==Summary==
Life had lately been such a rush that Tolkien had not seen [[C.S. Lewis]] or [[Charles Williams]] for weeks, yet there was little to report â€“ no fun, amusement, new ideas, or even thin small jokes. All the papers had was the Teheran Ballyhoo.<ref group="note">The [[Wikipedia: Teheran Conference|Teheran Conference]] of November 1943 was attended by British, American, and Russian leaders.</ref> Tolkien was sickly amused that the bloodthirsty murderer Josef Stalin invited all nations to join to abolish tyranny and intolerance. Tolkien thought that Winston Churchill looked like the biggest ruffian in the photographs.

Tolkien lamented that the globe was getting smaller, duller, and flatter, foreseeing American sanitation, morale-pep, feminism, and mass production introduced everywhere, which would at least cut down travel. Col. Knox<ref group="note">A writer and popular journalist</ref> said that one-eighth of the world spoke "English", which Tolkien called a damn shame. He called for the curse of Babel to strike all tongues and considered refusing to speak anything but [[Wikipedia:Mercian dialect|Old Mercian]].

Seriously, Tolkien found Americo-cosmopolitanism terrifying. He was unsure if victory would be much better for the world as a whole. This was the sentiment of a lot of folk but indicated no lack of patriotism. Tolkien loved England but not Great Britain and certainly not the British Commonwealth. But were he younger, Tolkien figured he would be grousing in the military, willing to go to the bitter end, and hoping that things might turn out better for England.
