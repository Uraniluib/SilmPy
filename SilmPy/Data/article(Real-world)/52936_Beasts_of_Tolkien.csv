==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|This intricately drawn adult colouring book dives into the depths of J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination, exploring the creatures that fly, crawl and stalk their way through his magnificent works. Bestiary of Tolkien features [[horses]] of [[Arda]], winged [[Fire-drakes]] including [[Smaug]] the Golden, and of course the evil [[Gollum]] who finally meets his fate at [[Mount Doom]] after the deadly quest of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Put your own imagination to good use and step away from the day-today with this enchanting colouring book which brings Tolkien's beasts to life. This book is unofficial and not authorised by the [[Tolkien Estate]] or [[HarperCollins]] Publishers.<ref name=AMUK/>}}
