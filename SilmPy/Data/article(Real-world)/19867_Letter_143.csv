==Summary==
Tolkien told [[Rayner Unwin]] he would send Book III, the first part of [[The Two Towers|Volume II]], carefully corrected. Book IV would follow later. Tolkien expressed some doubt in the title - ''The Two Towers'' - as the opposition between [[Orthanc]] and [[Tower of Cirith Ungol|Cirith Ungol]] was completely overshadowed by that of the [[Barad-d√ªr|Dark Tower]] and [[Minas Tirith]].
