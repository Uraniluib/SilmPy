'''Mary Renault''', née Mary Challans, ([[4 September]] [[1905]] – [[13 December]] [[1983]]) was an English author of primarily historical novels.

Renault read English at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], graduating in 1928. She was a student of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s,<ref>David Sweetman, ''Mary Renault: A Biography''</ref>  though probably just attending his lectures rather than being tutored by him.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?77153-Tolkien-and-Mary-Renault|articlename=Tolkien and Mary Renault|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=8 April 2014}}</ref>

Writing to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer on 8 February 1967, Tolkien says that he has been "recently deeply engaged in the books" of Renault, and mentions in particular her works ''[[Wikipedia:The King Must Die|The King Must Die]]'' and ''[[Wikipedia:The Bull from the Sea|The Bull from the Sea]]'' (both about [[Wikipedia:Theseus|Theseus]]). Tolkien also tells the Plimmers that Renault has written Tolkien a card of appreciation, "perhaps the piece of 'Fan-mail' that gives me most pleasure".<ref>{{L|294|2}}</ref> And writing to his secretary [[Joy Hill]] on 25 August 1967, he mentions the fan-letter again (received "not long ago"), and tells Hill that he wonders how Renault would answer a particular question.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 706</ref>
