'''''The Reeve's Tale: Version Prepared for Recitation at the 'Summer Diversions', Oxford, 1939''''' was prepared by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to accompany his performance on [[28 July]] [[1939]] of [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:The Reeve's Tale|The Reeve's Tale]]'' at the 'Summer Diversions' - a festival of recitals, plays and ballet.

Includes a two page introduction by Tolkien to a slightly reworked version of the text of ''The Reeve's Tale'' by Chaucer as printed by Skeat. The changes to the text seem to have been made for length and to cut out some of the bawdier elements that may have offended at a public performance.<ref>''An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography'', at Tolkienbooks.net</ref>
