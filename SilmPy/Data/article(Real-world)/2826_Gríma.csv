'''Gríma Wormtongue''' (died [[Third Age]] November 3, 3019)<ref>{{App|B4}}</ref> was the chief advisor to King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan]]. He was the son of [[Gálmód]].<ref name=Golden/> 

==History==
Gríma was secretly in thrall to [[Saruman]], who had promised him [[Éowyn]]. Gríma not only informed Saruman about the secrets of [[Rohan]], but also worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom with his words and poison.

During the [[War of the Ring]], the Nine [[Nazgûl]] came to Rohan and questioned Wormtongue, who, terrified, answered that the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] had passed through Rohan, and also revealed to them where the [[The Shire|Shire]] was. He also told them that Saruman had lied to them in order to deny them this information, revealing his treachery against [[Sauron]].<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

Upon [[Gandalf]]'s arrival, Gríma tried to discredit him, until the wizard managed to heal Théoden. After this, "many things which men had missed" were found locked in Gríma's trunk and he was given a grim choice: ride into battle or into exile.<ref name=Golden>{{TT|III6}}</ref> Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at [[Orthanc]], where he witnessed the [[Battle of Isengard]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he mistakenly threw a "heavy rock"&mdash;which was actually the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' [[Orthanc-stone|of Orthanc]]&mdash;at the [[Rohirrim]] accompanying Gandalf, an act for which Saruman seems to have punished him severely.<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref>

While being held in Orthanc, Gríma became weak and thin. When [[Treebeard]] released him and Saruman in August, they left and headed west. On their way, they were confronted by Gandalf, [[Celeborn]], [[Galadriel]] and the Hobbits on their way to northern [[Dunland]]. They found them as travelling beggars and Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, as he exclaimed how he hated his master. Galadriel told Gríma that he was free to leave him but he did not reply.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

Saruman had already been exerting his control over the Shire from afar by sending [[ruffians|evil Men]] there, thus Saruman sought his revenge in petty tyranny over the Hobbits. During this time Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, almost resembling [[Gollum]], and Saruman shortened his nickname to "Worm". During this time he killed [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]], and may have eaten him.<ref name=RKVI8>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

Spurred by the words of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] that he did not have to follow Saruman, and being pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him, he used a hidden knife to slit the throat of [[Saruman]] and darted down the road. He was quickly killed by several Hobbit arrows, and thus Wormtongue was the final casualty of the War of the Ring.<ref name=RKVI8/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Gríma'' derives from the [[Old English]] or [[wikipedia:Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word meaning "mask, visor, helmet" or "spectre".<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 404</ref><ref>Hálfdan Helgason (1991), [http://www.halfdan.is/vestur/nofn.htm#grím ''The Emigration from Iceland to North America: Icelandic first names''], accessed 12 October 2010</ref><ref>Joseph Bosworth, "[http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/017508 gríma]"  at ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (online, accessed 12 October 2010)</ref> It is also possible to link the name to the English word "grim", which among other characteristics meant "ugly" in Old English.<ref>Joseph Bosworth, "[http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/009520 EORL]" at ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (online, accessed 12 October 2010)</ref>

''Wormtongue'' is a modernised form of [[Old English]] ''wyrm-tunge'' ("snake-tongue").<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 764</ref>

==Inspiration==
J. Allard suggests that Wormtongue was based on Unferth from ''[[Beowulf]]'', a character that sits near King Hrothgar and serves as a taunter.<ref>J. Allard, ''Beowulf and Other Stories'' (2014) p. 45-7</ref>

'''1956: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)]]'':'''
:[[Bernard Rebel]] played Gríma.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by [[Michael Deacon]].

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:[[John Vickery]] played Gríma.
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Paul Brooke]] played Gríma.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from [[The Hunt for the Ring]] when he is questioned by the Nazgul on his way to Isengard.  His death at Bag End is also included in the final episode.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Gríma is played by [[Brad Dourif]]. The reason for Gríma's pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Saruman he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Gollum to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Wormtongue was one of the "bad guys" in the large and confusing cast of characters.

:The events of "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]" do not appear in the film version, so Saruman's death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the tower of [[Orthanc]], the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. Saruman's body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his war machines. Gríma himself is shot by an arrow fired by Legolas, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Saruman blamed Gríma for killing [[Théodred]], replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.
