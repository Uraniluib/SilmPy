{{quote|I am Tuor son of Huor of the House of Hador and the kindred of Húrin, and these names, I am told, are not unknown in the Hidden Kingdom.|Tuor to [[Elemmakil]], captain of the Outer Guard of [[Gondolin]].<ref name="UT1">{{UT|1}}.</ref>}}
'''Tuor Eladar''' (born {{FA|472}}) was a hero of the [[Edain]] in the last years of the [[First Age]], and the father of [[Eärendil]]. In spite of being a Man, he was chosen by the Vala Ulmo to be the last hope of the Noldor in the face of annihilation by the forces of Morgoth.

Born in the winter of the 'Year of Lamentation', Tuor's life coincided with the final defeat of the Edain and the [[Noldor|Noldor-in-Exile]] by the forces of [[Morgoth]]. He was of the [[House of Hador]],<ref name="UT1" /><ref name="Shibboleth">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> but after the deaths of his parents [[Huor]] and [[Rían]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] was fostered by the surviving [[Elves of Mithrim]]. He passed his youth a refugee and an outlaw, before being guided by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]] to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]]. There he rose high in the favour of the [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Turgon]] and wedded the elf-maiden [[Idril]], the King's daughter. Escaping the [[Fall of Gondolin|fall of Gondolin]], he and his family came to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. After abiding there long enough to see Eärendil to manhood Tuor finally succumbed to his [[sea-longing]] and, with Idril, departed Middle-earth for the West. The tradition of the Noldor was that he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the [[Elves|elder kindred]] and will share with them an immortal life in [[Valinor]] as long as [[Arda]] will endure.<ref name="S23">{{S|23}}</ref><ref name="Letter153">{{L|153}}</ref>

==Family and heritage==
His father Huor and his elder brother [[Húrin Thalion]], were fostered with their kin in [[Brethil]]. They were of the [[House of Hador]], but also descended from the [[House of Haleth]] through their mother [[Hareth]]. During a battle following the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the brothers escaped the hordes of [[Morgoth]] with the aid of [[Ulmo]], and [[Thorondor]] brought them to [[Gondolin]]. Ulmo counselled [[Turgon]] the [[Hidden King]] to treat them as guests, as help would come to him from their House. After they learnt much from the Gondolindrim, Turgon reluctantly waived his law and let them leave on a condition of silence.<ref name="RuinOfBeleriand">{{S|18}}</ref>

On his return, Huor married [[Rían]], of the [[House of Bëor]]. Thus Tuor was a descendant of all the [[Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]]. When Tuor was conceived, Huor gave him his name before he was born. Months later Huor fell in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] defending the retreat of Turgon, speaking his last words to the Elven King: "...out of your house shall come the hope of Elves and Men... from you and from me a new star shall arise".<ref>{{CH|2}}, p. 58</ref>

==History==
After hearing news of the battle Rían became distraught and left [[Dor-lómin]] to wander alone in the wild. She was rescued by the [[Sindar]] of [[Mithrim]] who took her to their dwelling in the [[Mountains of Mithrim|mountains]]. Before the end of the year Tuor was born and was given to the [[Elves of Mithrim]] to be fostered. Rían, having heard from [[Annael]] the leader of the Elves the news of Huor's death, made her way to the [[Haudh-en-Ndengin]], where she laid down in grief and died.<ref name="TurinTurambar">{{S|21}}.</ref>

Soon after [[Hithlum]] was occupied by the [[Swarthy Men]] who had joined Morgoth in the Nírnaeth. Annael and his people therefore took refuge in the caves of [[Androth]], where Tuor spent his youth. At the age of sixteen Tuor wished to make war upon the Orcs and the [[Incomers]] who oppressed the land of his fathers, but was forbidden by Annael. Rather in {{FA|488}} the group resolved to flee Hithlum by the [[Annon-in-Gelydh]] and make their way to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Soon after setting out however they were assailed by Orcs and forced to scatter into the night. Tuor, however, refused to flee, and stood his ground, slaying many enemies before being captured.

===Journeys in the Wild===

Tuor was thrall in the House of [[Lorgan]], chief of the Easterlings of Dor-lómin, for three years. He was treated harshly because Lorgan knew of his lineage, but nevertheless endured the torment until he found his opportunity to escape. Upon being sent into the woods on an errand he slew his guards and, escaping pursuit, returned to the caves of Androth. For the next four years he dwelt alone there as an outlaw, slaying many Easterlings and accumulating a large price on his head. He was seeking the Annon-in-Gelydh &ndash; the 'Gate of the Noldor' through the [[Ered Lómin]], by which Annael had intended to escape Hithlum unnoticed. After years of searching, the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], who had long ago chosen Tuor as his instrument, sent him a sign that finally led to the Gate of the Noldor. Upon reaching its entrance Tuor met [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], messengers of [[Círdan]] who were seeking a way to [[Gondolin]], and they showed him the path through the mountains to [[Nevrast]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Ulmo Appears before Tuor.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Ted Nasmith]] - '' Ulmo Appears before Tuor'']]
In {{FA|495}} Tuor passed through Nevrast and became the first Man to reach the shores of [[Belegaer]], the Great Sea, and felt for the first time the [[sea-longing]] that would stay with him the rest of his life. He lingered by Belegaer until the autumn, and then after receiving another sign from Ulmo followed seven [[swans]] southward. These led him to the abandoned city of [[Vinyamar]] where long ago Turgon had dwelt and, at the behest of Ulmo, left a sword, armour and a shield bearing the device of a white swan on a blue field. Tuor took these arms and made his way to the shore. Then during a great storm the Lord of Waters finally appeared to Tuor directly, ordering him to seek the city of Gondolin, and giving him a cloak that had a power to hide him from foes. The next morning he met [[Voronwë]] &ndash; an elf of Gondolin who had been shipwrecked off the coast of Beleriand and rescued and brought to Vinyamar by Ulmo. After hearing Tuor speak the words of Ulmo Voronwë agreed to guide him to the hidden gate of Gondolin.

===Life in Gondolin===
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Man in Black.jpg|thumb|left|Šárka Škorpíková - ''Man in Black'']]
Voronwë led Tuor through [[Núath]], a land desolated by the recent passing of [[Glaurung]] the Dragon to [[Nargothrond]]. At the [[Pools of Ivrin]] Tuor caught a brief glimpse of his ill-fated cousin [[Túrin]], son of Hurin, as he cried for [[Finduilas]] &ndash; the only time their two paths ever crossed. Then after enduring a [[Fell Winter (First Age)|bitter winter]] Tuor and Voronwë finally reached the gate of Gondolin. They were taken as prisoners by [[Elemmakil]] and brought before [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]] who, recognising from his arms that Tuor had been sent by Ulmo, welcomed into the city with honour. Tuor then came before the [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] Turgon and delivered the message of Ulmo: the [[Doom of Mandos]] was nearing its fulfilment and Turgon should abandon his city and retreat to the Havens of Sirion.
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Tuor Reaches the Hidden City of Gondolin.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Tuor Reaches the Hidden City of Gondolin'']]
Turgon however chose not to heed Ulmo's warning, though it did prompt him to block up the hidden door and make Gondolin's isolation complete. Therefore Tuor remained in Gondolin and like his father before him he learned much from the Elves. He fell in love with [[Idril|Idril Celebrindal]], the daughter of the King, and she with him, and in {{FA|502}} they were married.<ref>{{WJ|P3}}, note 18.</ref> This union, as well as the favour of the King and the memory of his father, endeared Tuor to the people of Gondolin and he was made the leader of the [[House of the Wing]]. Only [[Maeglin]] and his followers harboured a secret hatred and jealousy of him.

===The Fall of Gondolin===
[[Image:John Howe - The Fall of Gondolin.jpg|thumb|[[John Howe]] - ''The Fall of Gondolin'']]
Soon after their union a [[Half-elven]] was born to Tuor and Idril, who was named [[Eärendil]] or 'Sea-friend', reflecting the 'sea-longing' Tuor passed to his son<ref name="Letter297">{{L|297}}</ref>. But in {{FA|510}} Gondolin's secrecy finally failed. First Húrin, Tuor's uncle, released from Morgoth's long torment and attempting to enter the city, revealed its location in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Still Morgoth would not have found an entrance to the city were it not for the treachery of Maeglin, who having defied the King's order and ventured outside the encircling mountains was captured by Orcs and brought to Angband &ndash; there he betrayed Turgon in return for the promise of the lordship of Gondolin and the possession of Idril.

During the subsequent [[Fall of Gondolin|siege]] Tuor fought valiantly. He rescued Idril from Maeglin, throwing the Dark Elf from the walls of the city to his death. But in the end Gondolin fell and Turgon was killed. Tuor and Idril led the survivors of the sack in a desperate escape through the [[Idril's secret way|secret way]] Idril had prepared and over the mountains. Protected by Ulmo they journeyed down the vale of [[Sirion]] to the Havens at its mouth &ndash; the last refuge of the Elves of Beleriand. On the way the remnant of Gondolin stopped in [[Nan-tathren]] to make a feast in memory of the fallen, and here Tuor composed ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]'' for his son Eärendil.

===Fate===
Tuor and Idril dwelt for a while at the Mouths of Sirion. But eventually the sea-longing that had been instilled in him when he first came to the shores of Belegaer grew too strong. In {{FA|525}} he built a ship, [[Eärrámë]] ([[Quenya|Q]]: 'Sea-wing'), and sailed to the [[Aman|West]] with Idril, and possibly Voronwë also.<ref name="WJ-TYears">{{WJ|Years}}</ref> It was a tradition under the [[Eldar]] and [[Edain]] that they arrived in [[Valinor]], and that Tuor alone of Men was counted among the Eldar, immortal as other Elves.<ref group="note">Apparently by the special will of [[Ilúvatar]] himself; see [[Letter 153]].</ref>

However Huor's prophecy on the field of Nírnaeth Arnoediad proved true. In the same year that Tuor and Idril departed, Eärendil married [[Elwing]]. At first seeking after his father, he sailed to Valinor and roused the Valar to the [[War of Wrath]], and so became the prophesied saviour of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth. Through Eärendil Tuor was an ancestor of the [[Half-elven]] and the [[Kings of Númenor]].

==Character and traits==
Tuor was "fair of face" and inherited the golden hair of the [[House of Hador]]. As a man he was "strong and tall and valiant" and skilled at arms. But being raised by [[Elves]] he also had great lore and skill.<ref name="UT1p23-24">{{UT|1}}, pp. 23-24</ref>
==Genealogy==
His paternal grandfather [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] was the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]],<ref name="SComingOfMen">{{S|17}}.</ref> so Tuor technically inherited that title after the death of his cousin [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] in {{FA|499}}, though by that time Dor-lómin had long since ceased to exist as a realm of the Edain. In [[Gondolin]] he was made the Lord of the [[House of the Wing]].

==Etymology==

The name ''Tuor'' was adapted to [[Sindarin]] from the language of the [[Edain]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 348, 364 (note 49)</ref><ref group=note>In a draft for a letter, Tolkien used the form ''Túor'' (cf. {{L|153}}).</ref>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Noldorin]] ''Tuor'' ("strength-vigour") derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''tūghor, tū-gor'' ([[Sundocarme|root]] TUG-).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 394</ref> In the context of this etymology, ''Tuor'' can likely be analysed as ''[[tû]]'' ("strength") + a derivative of root GOR ("violence, impetus, haste").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 359 (entry GOR-), 394 (entry TUG-)</ref>

Tuor bore the epithets '''''[[Eladar]]''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] 'Starfather'), '''''[[Ulmondil]]''''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] 'Friend of Ulmo')<ref name="EladarUlmondil">{{WJ|West}}</ref> and '''[[the Blessed]]'''.<ref name="TheBlessed">{{GA|144}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Tuor is intimately connected with the tale of 'The Fall of Gondolin', one of the core legends of the [[Elder Days]] and the earliest narratives of the [[legendarium]] to be composed by Tolkien.<ref name="UTIntro">{{UT|Introduction}}.</ref> A compressed version of the story written between 1926 and 1930 was edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and included in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' as ''[[Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin]]''. There also exists a more substantial but unfinished narrative, started by Tolkien in 1951, which was published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' under the title ''[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]''.

===''The Fall of Gondolin''===
The only 'complete' source on Tuor therefore remains the very early ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', written while Tolkien was on sick-leave from the army in [[1917]] and later incorporated into ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In this version nothing is said about Tuor's early life and lineage, though later he introduces himself to the [[Gondolindrim|Gondothlim]] as "Tuor son of [[Peleg]] son of [[Indor]] of the [[house of the Swan]] of the sons of the Men of the North". He is described as a hermit ("Tuor of the lonely heart") living in the woods of Mithrim who simply happened upon the Gate of the Noldor and so came to live in a cave by the sea. Ulmo&mdash;employing swans, which Tuor as in later versions took as his emblem&mdash;then guided Tuor from the shores of the sea to a group of Noldor, who took him through the fenland region of [[Arlisgion]] and hence to the [[Nan-tathren|Land of Willows]]. Here Tuor would have stayed, but Ulmo appeared to him directly and ordered him to seek Gondolin. In this version he did not receive his arms from Turgon until he reached Gondolin.

[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Flight of the Doomed.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Flight of the Doomed'']]

Conversely Tuor's years in Gondolin are described more fully in the ''Lost Tale'' than in any subsequent text. He bore an axe called [[Dramborleg]] and is said to lived in a house on the southern wall of the city. He is also named as the leader of one of twelve Houses of Gondolin, the [[House of the Wing]], whose emblem was the wing of a swan or gull. Tuor's deeds in the [[Fall of Gondolin|battle for the city]] are also given. After rescuing Idril and [[Eärendil|Eärendel]] from the treacherous [[Maeglin|Meglin]], and leaving Voronwë to guard them, he and his company made their way to the battle at the gate. Here they fought alongside [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]] as [[dragons]] pulled down the walls of the city and enemies poured in. Tuor is said to have slain three [[orcs|orc-lords]]: [[Othrod]], [[Balcmeg]] and [[Lug]]; as well as five [[balrogs]]. Eventually however he was forced to retreat bearing the injured Ecthelion. After being rescued by [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] in the [[Square of the Folkwell]], he rallied what remained of the defenders of the city and made for the [[Square of the Palace of Turgon|King's Square]]. During its defence Tuor was set upon by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, lord of Balrogs]] and would have perished, but Ecthelion came to his aid and slew the Balrog, going to his own death in the attempt. At this point Turgon conceded the city was lost, as [[Doom of Mandos|Mandos had foretold]], and though he himself resolved to stay in the city ordered Tuor to lead the survivors through Idril's secret way. When they emerged onto the plain of [[Tumladen|Tumladin]] a [[Ulmo|miraculous]] mist, and Tuor rescued Eärendel, who had fled the city earlier with a servant called [[Hendor]], from a pack of wolf-riders. Tuor and the refugees were then attacked once more as they fled over the encircling mountains, by a balrog, but [[Thorondor]] and his [[eagles]] came to their aid. [[Glorfindel]] slew the balrog but was himself killed when its body fell on him.

The ''Fall of Gondolin'' ends with Tuor, Idril and Eärendel living at the Mouths of Sirion, however in Tolkien's notes for what was to be the next chapter of ''The Book of Lost Tales'' he mentions that Tuor disappeared while at sea.<ref name="LT2Earendel">{{HM|LT2}}, "[[The Tale of Eärendel]]".</ref>

In the different manuscripts of ''The Fall of Gondolin'' Tolkien alternated between Tuor and '''Tûr''', but eventually settled on Tuor in the 1930s ''Silmarillion''.
