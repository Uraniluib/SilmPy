'''Bór the Faithful''' (died {{FA|472}}) was a leader of a tribe of [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] during the [[First Age]].

== History ==
Bór's people came into [[Beleriand]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. He and his sons [[Borlad]], [[Borlach]], and [[Borthand]] swore allegiance to [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]].<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> He was one of the few leaders of the Eastern Tribes of Men to remain faithful to the Eldar during the [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad]] (Battle of Unnumbered Tears). This loyalty came at the cost of his life. The elves, grateful for his loyalty,  posthumously awarded him the title "Faithful".

== Etymology ==
