'''Ballantine Books''', founded in [[1952]] by Ian Ballantine, is a major American book publisher. It was acquired by Random House in [[1973]], and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter "B"'s back to back.

During the early 1950s, Ballantine attracted attention as one of the leading publishers of paperback science fiction and fantasy. In the early 1960s the company engaged in a well-known rivalry with [[Ace Books]] for the rights to reprint the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and Edgar Rice Burroughs in paperback form. Ballantine prevailed in the struggle for the Tolkien corpus, and the two companies agreed to split the Burroughs list.
