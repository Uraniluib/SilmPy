'''CDC Games''' (Chinese: 中华网游戏集团) is a Chinese company, specialized in developing and publishing video games. In 2006 CDC Games made an agreement with [[Turbine]], to published [[The Lord of the Rings Online]] in China. They released a beta, for which you had to pay to get access. Though spending $10.000.000 on the game, they still hadn't published anything in [[2011]]. Turbine saw this as a contract breach and terminated the agreement.<ref>{{webcite|author=Jef Reahard|articleurl=http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/09/15/lord-of-the-rings-online-still-not-available-in-china/|articlename=Lord of the Rings Online still not availble in China|dated=15 September 2011|website=Massively|accessed=2 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.mmocrunch.com/2011/09/15/lotro-fails-to-launch-in-china-after-5-years/|articlename=LOTRO Fails to Launch in China After 5 Years|dated=15 September 2011|website=MMO Crunch|accessed=2 January 2012}}</ref>
