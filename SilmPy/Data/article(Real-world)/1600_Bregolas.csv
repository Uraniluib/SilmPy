'''Bregolas''' ({{FA|393}}-{{FA|455|n}}<ref name="WJwest">{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref>) was the third [[Lord of Ladros]].

==History==
Bregolas was the elder son and third child of [[Bregor]], fifth chieftain of the [[House of Bëor|Bëorians]], and he was a direct descendant of [[Bëor|Bëor the Old]]. Bregolas inherited the lordship because his two elder siblings were females. His younger brother was [[Barahir]], his two elder sisters were ''[[Bregil]]'' and ''[[Hirwen]]'', and his youngest sister was ''[[Gilwen]]''. Barahir his brother was the father of [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]]; Bregolas himself had two sons, [[Baragund]] the elder and [[Belegund]] the younger, and an only daughter ''[[Beleth]]'' who was his first child.<ref name="WJwest"/> Bregolas fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (Battle of Sudden Flames) beside the Elven-lords [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]], younger sons of the Noldorin High-king [[Finarfin]] in [[Aman]], and the brothers of the Elven-king [[Finrod|Finrod Felegund]] in [[Beleriand]]; and Bregolas was eventually slain with the brothers. Bregolas was the grandfather of [[Morwen]] the daughter of Baragund, and [[Rían]] the daughter of Belegund.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', ''Bregolas'' is said to be an [[Exilic Noldorin]] word for "fierceness", from the root  BERÉK-.<ref name=Etym>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root BERÉK-</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In the ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', created in the 1930s,<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p, 3</ref> Bëor was directly followed by Bregolas and [[Barahir]], who were his sons (and Bregolas was born in {{FA|400}}<ref>{{GA|124}}, p. 49</ref>).  After publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' a new genealogy for the [[House of Bëor]] was made in the 1950s and at that time four generations were inserted after Bëor, with Bregor becoming the father of Bregolas and Barahir.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 229</ref>
