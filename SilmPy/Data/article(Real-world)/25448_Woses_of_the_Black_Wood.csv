== Cover/Jacket Text == 

Three low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

Over the years, the people of Bor Leath have experienced perils that would daunt the hardiest. Now, a new terror walks the night. Can you put a stop to The Haunting of Bor Leath? 

Ten miles to the north of Bor Leath lies the home of Coel, the herb mistress. She has befriended the local animals who shield her from the dangers of the Black Wood. What will you encounter in the Adventures Around the Cabden? 

The Woses make good use of the extensive grottos that delve deep into the Bare Hills. They carefully guard the halls and treasures, reminders of past prosperity. Are you willing to face the Darkwood Woses? 

The promise of riches calls, but danger walks throughout these 3 exciting adventures!
