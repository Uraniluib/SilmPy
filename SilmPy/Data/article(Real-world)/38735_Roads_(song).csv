'''Roads''' is a song performed by [[Glenn Yarbrough]], based on "[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]". The music was written by [[Maury Laws]]. It is the fourth track of the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The song was reprised in the [[1980]] follow-up, [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'']], where it was given a new lyric by [[Jules Bass]], and its melody also used for another song in the film called "[[It's So Easy Not to Try]]" (for which Bass also wrote the lyric).

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Roads go ever, ever on, 
Over rock and under tree,
By caves where never sun has shown,
By streams that never find the sea.

Roads go ever, ever on,
Under cloud and under star,
Yet feet that wandering have gone
Will turn at last to home afar.
Over snow by winter sown,
And through the merry flowers of June,
Over grass and over stone,
Under the mountains in the moon.

Roads go ever, ever on, 
Over rock and under tree,
By caves where never sun has shown,
By streams that never find the sea.
