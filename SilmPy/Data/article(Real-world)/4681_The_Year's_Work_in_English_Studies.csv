'''''The Year's Work in English Studies''''' was a journal published annually by the English Association. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] contributed three essays for the section ''Philology: General Works'':
* Volume 4 for 1923 (published in January 1925, though imprint date states 1924), pages 20-37 .
* Volume 5 for 1924 (published in March 1926), pages 26-65.
* Volume 6 for 1925 (published in February 1927), pages 32-66.

Tolkien wrote about writing the W sections for the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as well as publications concerning names of places. Throughout the essays he attempted to inform the reader while including bits of humor to entertain.<ref>{{CG|CG}}</ref>
