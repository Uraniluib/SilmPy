'''ToME''', or '''Tales (or Troubles) of Middle Earth''', is a roguelike computer game created in 1998 by someone who identifies himself only as DarkGod. ToME is an [[Angband_(game)|Angband]] variant, originally based on the [[Angband (computer game)|ZAngband]] 2.2.9a source code, which now differs greatly from it. '''ToME''' was also used as a base for many derivative games known as modules.  Popular modules include '''FuryMod''', '''Theme''', and '''Annals of Ea'''.

The game was originally known as '''PernAngband''', and was essentially a crossover that placed characters from Anne McCaffrey's fictional world of Pern into [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s fictional world of [[Arda]].

By the time of version 5.x.x, PernAngband had attracted a substantial online community. However, it came under legal threat from Anne McCaffrey and from [[Ubisoft]], a company that had created several licensed Pern-related games. DarkGod removed the Pern elements and changed the name of the game to ToME.

The game is set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Arda, although other influences include H. P. Lovecraft and Roger Zelazny's Amber universe. These are inherited from [[Angband (computer game)|Chthangband]] and ZAngband, respectively.

The player creates a character from an extended list of races and classes, ranging from [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] warriors to [[Elves|Elven]] magi. The player then explores the world of middle-earth, destroying monsters, finding items, and gaining power, with the ultimate goal to destroy [[Morgoth|Morgoth, Lord of Darkness]].

There is also a multiplayer version of ToME, which is called TomeNET.

ToME is open source and under active development. Bugs should be reported on ToME's own [http://wiki.t-o-m-e.net/BugReports wiki]. Currently in alpha release is ToME&nbsp;3, which will include greater support for the Lua programming language and drastically change the internal handling of objects and flags.

Important features of ToME which are not in Angband include:
*Skill points based character progression
*Special levels/quests
*Multiple dungeons and towns with a large wilderness
*New schools of magic-based spell system
*More races, subraces and classes
*Leveling artifacts and monsters
*New monsters and items
*Support for modules (partial variants based entirely on scripts)
