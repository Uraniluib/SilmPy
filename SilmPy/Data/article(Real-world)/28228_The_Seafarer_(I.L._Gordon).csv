Bliss]]).<ref>Ida Gordon (1960), ''The Seafarer''</ref> Initially prepared by [[E.V. Gordon]] (the husband of [[Ida Gordon|I.L. Gordon]]) and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the work remained unpublished when the former died in 1938.<ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]], ''[[A Question of Time]]'' (2001), p. 262</ref> Ida Gordon reworked the uncompleted draft and published the edition in 1960. Because of the large revision, ''The Seafarer'' was published in her own name, but "Tolkien's work and assistance were generously acknowledged."<ref>[[Wayne G.

==From the Preface==
[The following quote contains the only references to Tolkien]

"''When my husband, Professor E. V. Gordon, died in 1938 he left an uncompleted draft of an edition of ''The Wanderer'' and ''The Seafarer'', on which he had been working in collaboration with Professor J. R. R. Tolkien. And my first intention, with Professor Tolkien's approval, was to bring into final form that edition. [...] I have submitted the edition under my own name because it represents a view of the poem basically different from that of the original draft. Nevertheless, the edition incorporates much of the original material, especially in the Notes. [...] I wish to thank Professor Tolkien for some notes given to me with his usual generosity [...]''"
