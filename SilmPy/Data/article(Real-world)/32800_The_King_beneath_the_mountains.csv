==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The King beneath the mountains,
    The King of carven stone,
The lord of silver fountains
    Shall come into his own!

His crown shall be upholden,
    His harp shall be restrung,
His halls shall echo golden
    To songs of yore re-sung.

The woods shall wave on mountains
    And grass beneath the sun;
His wealth shall flow in fountains
    And the rivers golden run.

The streams shall run in gladness,
    The lakes shall shine and burn,
All sorrow fail and sadness
    At the Mountain-king's return!

:[[Bard]] notices that one of the [[Dwarves]] he is hosting is named [[Thorin]], and realizes their identity. He remembers the "prophecy", which is actually some lines from the poem. When the line "''The lakes shall shine and burn''" is said, he notices the light of the sunset coloring the waters of the [[Long Lake]] orange-red.
