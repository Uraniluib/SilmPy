'''Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye''' (MELE), released in [[1997]], was the second basic set of the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''. MELE adds the possibility to play as a Ringwraith of Sauron and arguably makes the game more complicated with all sorts of support and effect cards.

*'''Number of individual cards:''' 417

MELE was sold in starters and boosters (no cards from other sets needed to play). A booster (15 cards, 36 boosters per display) holds 1 rare, 4  uncommons, and 10 commons. A starter holds a fixed set (you can choose), an equivalent of 3 boosters, and 7 extra commons.
