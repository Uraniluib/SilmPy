'''Hirgon''' was an emissary of [[Gondor]] who presented the [[Red Arrow]] to [[Théoden]] King of [[Rohan]].

==History==
Hirgon had set out on the command of [[Denethor]], [[Steward of Gondor]], with a companion, and narrowly escaped [[Orcs]] in [[Anórien]]'s woods.<ref name="Muster"/>  He presented the Arrow on [[9 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and rode back toward [[Minas Tirith]] the next day.<ref name="Muster"/>  

Hirgon and his companion were caught by [[Sauron]]'s forces at the [[Rammas Echor]], and were slain before they could reach the White City. When Théoden's Riders found their bodies, Théoden understood that Denethor did not receive his message that the Riders were coming for help.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
