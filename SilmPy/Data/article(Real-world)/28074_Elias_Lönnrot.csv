'''Elias Lönnrot''' ([[9 April]] 1802 – [[19 March]] [[1884]]) was a Finnish philologist and collector of traditional Finnish oral poetry. He is best known for composing the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the Finnish national epic compiled from national folklore, which had a great impact on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]; [[Verlyn Flieger]] (ed.), "'The Story of Kullervo' and Essays on Kalevala", in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 7]]'', pp. 211</ref>.

In a 2007 article<ref>Jason Fisher, "From Mythopoeia to Mythography: Tolkien, Lönnrot, And Jerome", in ''[[The Silmarillion: Thirty Years On]]''. Ed. Allan Turner. Zollikofen: Walking Tree Publishers, 2007. 111–38, pp. 121–2</ref>, [[Jason Fisher]] makes a comparison between [[Christopher Tolkien]] and Lönnrot, from the aspect that both ''"smoothed out complex, irregular source material into a coherent text"''<ref>[[David Bratman]], "The Year's Work in Tolkien Studies 2007", in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 7]]'' (2010): 347–78, p. 359</ref>.
