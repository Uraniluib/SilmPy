'''''Tolkien Remembered''''' was a TV documentary about [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] which aired in 1992. The program presented Tolkien as somewhat of a literary renegade who read few modern writers and believed that English literature had ended with Chaucer. A philologist out of place in this century, he created his own world with its own completely functional language. Readings by Tolkien from [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Lord of the Rings]], and recollections by his children (to whom he read episodes of his work as bedtime stories) and his publisher, offer insights into his work. His biographer analyzes how Tolkien wrote, why he illustrated his writing, his friendship with [[C.S. Lewis]], and the jealousy displayed by fellow dons at [[Oxford]]. All of the information combined provides an extraordinary and unique portrait of a true eccentric genius and worldwide literary cult figure.
* '''Length:''' 38 minutes.
