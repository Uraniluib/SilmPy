'''Ancalagon the Black''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[aŋˈkalaɡon]}}) was the greatest of the winged [[Dragons|Dragons]] of [[Morgoth]].

==History==
During the [[War of Wrath]], the [[Valar]] waged their final war on [[Morgoth]]. Their victory was at hand, with most of the Dark Lord's [[Balrogs]] and other troops destroyed. But then, Morgoth unleashed the winged dragons, with Ancalagon at their [[Wikipedia:Vanguard|van]]. Ancalagon drove back the forces of the Valar, but was stopped by [[Eärendil]]. Ancalagon was no match for the mariner, who sailed through the skies in the ship [[Vingilot]], with the [[Silmaril]] upon his brow. Ancalagon was cast down and fell atop [[Thangorodrim]], breaking its mighty towers. With him fell most other dragons.<ref name="Voyage">{{HM|S}}, "[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]"</ref> Even by the late [[Third Age]] Ancalagon was considered the mightiest winged dragon, though Gandalf noted that that dragon could not melt [[the One Ring]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"</ref>
