'''Father Francis Xavier Morgan''' ([[18 January|January 18]], [[1857]] - [[11 June|June 11]], [[1935]]) was a Roman Catholic priest at the [[Birmingham Oratory]] in [[Birmingham]]. He was half Welsh and half Anglo-Spanish.

He took care of [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel Tolkien]] during her illness, and took over custody of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Ronald]] and [[Hilary Tolkien]] after her death. Father Francis was a [[J.R.R._Tolkien's_inspirations#pipe-smoking|pipe-smoker]] and Tolkien derived his own custom from this.

Father Francis Xavier Morgan, forbade Tolkien to see [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]] until he was twenty-one because he saw her as a distraction from his studies. With one exception, Tolkien obeyed this instruction to the letter while Father Morgan's guardianship lasted. 

Tolkien named his first son, [[John Tolkien|John Francis Reuel]] after him.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}</ref>

In 2013, [[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]] published ''[[La Conexion Española de J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', a Spanish-language biography about Francis Xavier Morgan.<ref>{{webcite|author="juanito panchacoco"|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythsoc/message/24179|articlename=A biography of Fr.
