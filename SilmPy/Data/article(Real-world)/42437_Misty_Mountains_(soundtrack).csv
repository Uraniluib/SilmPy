==Lyrics==
{{Blockquote|<poem>
Far over the [[Misty Mountains]] cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day,
To find our long-forgotten gold

The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light</poem>|[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Special Edition]] booklet}}
