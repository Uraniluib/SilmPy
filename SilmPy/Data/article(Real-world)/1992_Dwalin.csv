'''Dwalin''' ({{TA|2772}} – {{FoA|91}}<ref name="Line">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref>) was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the [[House of Durin]]. He was, along with his brother [[Balin]], a member of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] which took part in the quest for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Dwalin survived the adventure and lived well into the [[Fourth Age]].

==History==
Two years before he was born the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] had come to Erebor<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> and destroyed King [[Thrór]]'s kingdom.  Thrór and a small group of kinsmen and followers headed south while other [[Dwarves of Erebor]] escaped to the [[Iron Hills]]<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> so Dwalin was born in exile, perhaps in [[Dunland]]. 

After the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], [[Thráin II]] and [[Thorin]] settled in the northern<!--Or southern, this is a possible inconsistency that needs looking into.--> [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]]<ref name="Line">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref> and at some point Dwalin joined them.

===King Thráin's expedition===
Dwalin, his brother [[Balin]], and a few others accompanied [[Thráin|Thráin II]] in {{TA|2841}} when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor.  The small party was dogged by the emissaries of [[Sauron]].  In {{TA|2845|n}} Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of [[Mirkwood]] from a black rain.  After a fruitless search for their leader the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin.<ref name="Durin"/>

===The Quest for Erebor===
[[File:Adlpictures - Dwalin.jpg|200px|thumb|Adlpictures - ''Dwalin'']]Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at [[Bag End]] when the unexpected party began at Bilbo's hobbit hole.  He was wearing a dark-green hood and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo.  Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves.  Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]]) to lend a hand.  Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>

At the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, when Bilbo told the company that he had forgotten to bring his hat or his pocket-handkerchief, Dwalin gave him his spare dark-green hood and cloak to keep in place of a hat, but told him that he would "''have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things''" before the end of the journey. 

When the company rushed up into trees to escape the [[wargs]], Dwalin and Balin managed to swarm up a tall slender fir that had few branches for sitting.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  The next day, when the company arrived at [[Beorn]]'s hall, Dwalin and Balin were the third pair of Dwarves to appear during Gandalf's story.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

At the [[Enchanted River]] in Mirkwood, Dwalin was in the last boatload to cross.  He exited the boat just before the deer charged down the path and caused [[Bombur]] to fall in the water.  Later, after the Dwarves had been captured by the [[spiders]] and rescued by Bilbo, it was Dwalin who first realized that Thorin was missing.<ref name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

At the opening of the barrels after the escape from the halls of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy Dwarves and did nothing to help pull out other Dwarves.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

When the last week of autumn arrived it was Dwalin who complained the most about Bilbo's inactivity.  He felt that Bilbo, with his "invisible ring", ought to go through the [[Front Gate]] of Erebor and spy things out.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

Dwalin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  Afterwards he received his fourteenth share and chose to live in Erebor under [[Dáin Ironfoot]].<Ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Dwalin was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were still living in Erebor when [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] came to [[Rivendell]], as reported by [[Glóin]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>  Dwalin lived until {{FoA|91}}, later than any other known date of death for others of the company.<Ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
Dwalin was of Durin's line.<ref name="Line"/>

==Etymology==
In Norse mythology, ''Dvalinn'' is a chief Dwarf.<ref>Snorri Sturlusson, ''Edda'', "[[wikipedia:Skaldskaparmal|Skaldskaparmal]]"</ref> The origin of the name is uncertain; suggested etymologies are "one lying in a trance",<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', page 32</ref> "numb" and "dawdler".<ref>Henry A. Bellows (ed.), ''Völuspá'', "[http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm Poetic Edda]"</ref> Both words, ''dvalen'' ("to sleep") ''dvelja'' ("to delay") derive from the same root.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the early version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' it was Dwalin rather than Balin who spotted the Trolls' fire in the woods (and it was stated that Dwalin was always the Dwarves' look-out).<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref>  This contradicted the fact that Balin was the Dwarf who was looking for Bilbo at the inn at the start of the adventure<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref> and Tolkien eventually made Balin the permanent look-out.  However, Dwalin remained the first Dwarf to arrive at Bag End<ref name="Party"/> (what would be expected of the Company's look-out).  Dwalin was also the first to notice that Thorin was missing after the battle with the spiders,<ref name="Flies"/> a testament to his observational abilities.
