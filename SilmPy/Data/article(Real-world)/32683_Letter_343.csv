==Summary==
Tolkien was glad that Lanier had received a prize but was not surprised that it proved useless.  He had been similarly disappointed when a fan sent him a drinking goblet engraved with the terrible words from [[The One Ring|the Ring]].  He never drank from it but used it for tobacco ash instead.
