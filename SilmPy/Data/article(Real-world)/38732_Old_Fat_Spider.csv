'''Old Fat Spider''' is the third track on ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]'', and was adapted from the poem "[[Old fat spider spinning in a tree!]]" from ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The song, sung by [[Glenn Yarbrough]], is never actually featured anywhere in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]].

==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
I met an old, fat spider,
Spinning in his tree.
I said, "Hey old, fat spider, 
I bet you can't catch me!
You've grown too fat you lazy lob.
You're just an old Tomnoddy!
Hey Attercop!
Hey Attercop!
You can't catch anybody."

And then the old, fat spider,
He spun a final thread.
I said, "Hey old, fat spider,
It's time that you were dead!"
I drew my sword to cut his silk,
To kill the old Tomnoddy. 
But then I thought, I'll leave him be;
He can't catch anybody.

I met an old fat spider
In his spinning tree.
His web all old and tattered,
And he could hardly see.
I shooed a fly into his lair
To feed the old Tomnoddy.
'Cause how can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?
How can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?

I met an old, fat spider
In his spinning tree.
His web all old and tattered,
And he could hardly see.
I shooed a fly into his lair
To feed the old Tomnoddy.
'Cause how can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?
How can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?
