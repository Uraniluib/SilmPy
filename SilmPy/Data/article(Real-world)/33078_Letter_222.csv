}}{{letter|222}}
==Summary==
Unwin wanted Tolkien's translations of "[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]" and "[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]".  Tolkien replied that he was immersed, with the help of his secretary, in the reconstruction of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' but that Unwin's letter was a timely reminder that he should work on the poems.  After inspection, he stated that the translations did not need much work and that he could send the text of the two poems after Christmas.  Although uncertain about what to add as introductory material or notes, he did not think much was needed since people would either just want the translations or, if they wanted more, could find editions with full treatments of the problems presented by the poems.
==Note==
* The translations of these two poems, plus "[[Sir Orfeo (poem)|Sir Orfeo]]", were not published until 1975, after Tolkien's death.
