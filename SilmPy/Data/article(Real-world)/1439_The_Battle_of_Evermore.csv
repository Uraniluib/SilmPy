"'''The Battle of Evermore'''" is an acoustic guitar and mandolin track from [[Led Zeppelin]]'s fourth album. 

Folk singer Sandy Denny duets with Robert Plant. In live performances bassist John Paul Jones, who plays the mandolin on this track, sang along with Plant.

It is commonly believed to be based on events in ''[[The Return of the King]]''. 

In the most common interpretation, the Prince of Peace, who "embraced the gloom" and "walked the night alone", refers to Frodo, who left the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and left for [[Mordor]] with only his servant and friend [[Samwise Gamgee]] for company. "The Queen of Light" who "took her bow" is taken to refer to [[Galadriel]], a queen of the Elves, signifying that the [[Third Age]] is ending and that the [[Fourth Age|Age of Men]] will begin soon.

Other interpretations of how the lyrics relate to Tolkien exist: one example has the "Prince of Peace" referring to [[Aragorn]].  Probably the song's most compelling link to Tolkien is the reference to "Ringwraiths," a Tolkien invention.
