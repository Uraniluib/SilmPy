==Summary==
Tolkien told his son [[Michael Tolkien (b. 1920)|Michael]] of two women, mother and daughter-in-law, who were staying with the Tolkiens during the [[wikipedia:The Blitz|Blitz]]. They went back to London that morning, and Tolkien commented that he had never seen more simple, helpless, gentle and unhappy souls. Both women were away from their husbands for the first time in their lives, and "would prefer to be blown to bits".
