'''Taliska'''<ref group=note>The name "Taliska" is used in this article conventionally. See [[#Other versions of the Legendarium]]</ref> was a [[Mannish]] language spoken by the [[Edain]] of the [[House of Bëor]] and [[House of Hador]]. 

==Origins==
The ancestors of the folk of Beor and Marach were originally one group when they migrated to the West. In the northern [[Rhûn]] they met some [[Dwarves]]<ref>{{WJ|Dwarves}}</ref> who probably influenced their language.<ref name=DM>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> It was at the Northern shore of the [[Sea of Rhûn]] that the tribes separated. They didn't meet often, and their languages soon diverged.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, Note 13</ref> 

The [[House of Hador|Greater Folk]] seemed to have been related to the ancestors of the [[Northmen]]<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 4</ref> (whose language eventually evolved in the various [[Northern Mannish|languages of the Northmen]] in the [[Third Age]]<ref name=app>{{App|Men}}</ref>). The [[House of Bëor|Lesser Folk]] had extensive contact with the [[Dark Elves]], they adopted "many words and devices" that influenced their language.<ref name=men>{{S|17}}</ref><ref name=DM/>

==History==
When the two tribes reached [[Beleriand]], they already spoke different dialects. The language of the folk of Marach was more pure and they viewed the dialect of the folk of Beor, with the adopted Elvish elements, of lower status.<ref name=DM/>

The folk of Haleth spoke the unrelated [[Haladin]] tongue, which was unintelligible to the Houses of the Northern Tribes of Men.

The language of the House of Beor eventually was almost extinct, both because of the adoption of [[Sindarin]] and because the House was mostly annihilated after the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> On the other hand, the House of Hador did not wholly abandon their language, it survived the [[War of Wrath]] and was still spoken when the Edain migrated to [[Elenna]]. Thus it later became [[Adûnaic]].<ref name=men/>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
[[Helge Fauskanger]] and Ellen Schousboe noted several changes in the conception of Taliska:<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm|articlename=Mannish}}</ref>

*The name "Taliska" originally referred to the language of the Houses of Bëor and ''Haleth'' whereas it was the House of Hador that spoke another language, which would eventually be conceived as [[Adûnaic]]. In an early text by Tolkien, some words he labels as Taliska refer to terms which in the later version would be used by the [[Haladin]].

*Later, in the essay "[[Of Dwarves and Men]]" (published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-Earth]]''), Tolkien wrote that the Bëorians and Halethians did not speak related languages: The Hadorians still spoke "ancient Adûnaic", and the Bëorians had a closely related language; it was the language of Halethians that was unrelated to both of them (see [[pre-Númenorean]]). 

The later conception establishes a wider Hadorian/Beorian language, which however is not given a name. The fate of the term ''Taliska'' is vague, and while it could refer to the Halethian isolate (cf. the older conception) sometimes it's used conventionally to refer to the Hadorian/Beorian family.

==Inspiration==
Taliska was an early language developed by Tolkien. Unlike his later languages which are ''[[Wikipedia:A_priori_(languages)|a priori]]'', it was based directly on the Germanic languages, and has a lot in common with the [[Gothic]] language, an early interest of Tolkien;<ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 22</ref> this shows that Tolkien tried to connect his mythos with the origins of Europe, something that was evident in the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

The connection with Germanic persisted in the framework of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The Mannish languages that would derive from Adunaic, are rendered as [[Gothic]], [[Norse]], [[Old English]], modern English etc. Non-Taliskan languages are usually rendered with [[Celtic]] elements, if at all.<ref name=app/> (q.v. for more references).

A rather complete grammar and syntax of Taliska is known to exist, but despite work by [[Tolkienists]] this has not yet been published.
