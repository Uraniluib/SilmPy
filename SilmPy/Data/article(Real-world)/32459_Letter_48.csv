==Summary==
Lewis had been traveling around England giving talks on Christian religion to RAF stations and had become ill.  Tolkien was sorry to hear that Lewis had been sick, and with no U.Q.<ref group="notes">"Useless Quack", the nickname of fellow Inkling for R.E. Harvard, Tolkien and Lewis's doctor</ref> to suggest it was his final illness!  Their Wednesday meetings must be a duty since there seemed to be so many obstacles and fiendish devices opposing it.

Ridley<ref group="notes">M.R. Ridley of [[Wikipedia:Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] was teaching forces cadets on wartime "short courses", as were Tolkien and Lewis.</ref> was so astounded at the ignorance of all his cadets that he leapt at the chance of another hour.

Tolkien feared that Lewis was attempting too much and was tiring himself into an easy victim for sicknesses.  He hoped to persuade Lewis to reduce his travels to help with the cadets.  Tolkien's efforts had not prevailed and he needed Lewis.  Tolkien signed the letter "T"<ref group="notes">"T" for "Tollers", Lewis's usual name for Tolkien.</ref>

In a postscript Tolkien stated that Ridley had a test in which the first question listed a group of words to define.  ''Not one'' cadet got ''any'' of the words right.
