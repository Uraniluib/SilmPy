[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] on at least two occasions expressed his dislike of the ''Narnia'' books,<ref>{{L|265}}</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (24 December 1971)]]" (letter)</ref> giving the reason that it depended on "''merely a difference in taste''".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 758</ref> [[George Sayer]] has remarked that Tolkien's dislike of the novels derived from "''assembling figures from various mythologies''" and that the books "''were carelessly and superficially written''."<ref>[[George Sayer]], ''Jack: A Life of C.S. Lewis'' (2nd ed., 1994), p. 313)</ref> On the other hand, his granddaughter [[Joanna Tolkien]] remembers that her grandfather directed her to reading his copies of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' before ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', suggesting that it was "''perhaps an indication of his humility''".<ref>[[Joanna Tolkien]], "Joanna Tolkien Speaks at the Tolkien Society Annual Dinner, Shrewsbury, April 16, 1994", in ''[[Digging Potatoes, Growing Trees]]'' (ed. [[Helen Armstrong]]), p. 34</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 507</ref>
