==Text==
<poem>From the many-willow'd margin of the immemorial Thames,
    Standing in a vale outcarven in a world-forgotten day,
There is dimly seen uprising through the greenly veiled stems,
    Many-mansion'd, tower-crowned in its dreamy robe of grey,
All the city by the fording: aged in the lives of men,
Proudly wrapt in mystic mem'ry overpassing human ken.''</poem>
