'''''Beowulf and the Critics''''' was written in the 1930s and was probably delivered as a series of lectures to undergraduates.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s highly influential lecture, "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]", was a redaction of this. This edition of Tolkien's lecture series includes both versions of the text together with detailed explanatory notes.

Also included are two versions of the poem [[IÃºmonna Gold Galdre Bewunden]] (previously published in [[1923]] and [[1937]] respectively) along with an intermediate version (printed twice, the first time without the final stanza).

At least three impressions issued. A third impression copy has been seen with a grey stripe across the bottom right corner of the dustwrapper stating "Winner of the 2003 Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=14500|articlename=Beowulf and the Critics. 2002|dated=|website=TB|accessed=13 March 2012}}</ref>
