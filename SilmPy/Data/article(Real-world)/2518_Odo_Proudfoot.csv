{{Quote|'Proudfeet!' shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.|[[A Long-expected Party]]}}

'''Odo Proudfoot''' ({{SR|1304}} - {{SR|1405}}<ref name="Baggins">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>) was a Hobbit of the Shire.

==History==
Odo was the son of [[Bodo Proudfoot|Bodo]] and [[Bilbo Baggins]]' aunt, [[Linda Proudfoot|Linda]]<ref name="Baggins">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> and gave rise to a line of [[Proudfoot Family|Proudfoots]] (or, as Odo himself preferred, "Proudfeet").<ref name="Party"/> 

Odo was among the guests at the famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] at which Bilbo Baggins disappeared.<ref name="Party"/> At that time, he was an elderly hobbit indeed, being ninety-seven years old. He only lived for a few more years after the Party,<ref name="Baggins"/> but from him had come at least two generations of descendants, including his mischievous grandson [[Sancho Proudfoot|Sancho]], who attempted to excavate for treasure in [[Bag End]].<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Odo'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Oda''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
