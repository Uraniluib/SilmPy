The journal was founded in [[1980]]<!-- official info; but it seems like the first issue was published in 1983 or 1984, counting backwards from the issues I have - I've written and asked about the exact publ. year (User:Morgan) --> by Dr. [[Clyde S. Kilby]], Dr. Barbara Reynolds and Dr. Beatrice Batson, and is published by the [[Marion E. Wade Center]].

While most of the volumes include at least one article related to Tolkien, two issues are noteworthy for containing formerly [[Index:Unpublished material|unpublished quotes]] from [[Index:Writings by J.R.R. Tolkien|writings by Tolkien]]:
