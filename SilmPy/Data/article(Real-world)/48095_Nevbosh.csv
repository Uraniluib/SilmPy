'''''Nevbosh''''' (New Non Sense) is a language created in the 1910s by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his cousin [[Mary Incledon]] (1895-1940).

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], Tolkien and Mary "collaborated to invent [this] new and more sophisticated language".<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 55</ref>  However, Tolkien himself  told that his role in the construction of Nevbosh was more humble; he merely contributed to the vocabulary and influenced the spelling.<ref>{{HM|MC}}, p. 133</ref>
