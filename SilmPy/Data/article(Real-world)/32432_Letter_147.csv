==Summary==
The publishers altered the design of the dust-jacket for ''The Lord of the Rings'' in light of Tolkien's objections in [[Letter 146]].  Tolkien had received his advance copy the day before, called it a great moment and said that the book was very presentable indeed.  The new jacket he found much improved and rather striking; he liked the grey paper and preferred it to the other colours.

However, the specimens of jackets for [[The Two Towers|II]] and [[The Return of the King|III]] made the need for differentiation apparent to him.  Since the same device, for economy, was to be used throughout they all looked too much alike.  Perhaps they could vary the colour of the major lettering, he asked.  He did not mind at all and left it up to them.
