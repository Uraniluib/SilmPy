'''''The Hobbits: The Many Lives of Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin''''' investigates different [[Portal:Adaptations|adaptations]] of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|For generations of entranced readers, and now a new generation of filmgoers, Tolkien is synonymous with his most famous creationâ€”the hobbit.The beloved characters of Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been much-adapted for radio, television, film, and stage. Lynette Porter follows the hobbits through these many other lives, from Tolkien's on-page revisions and John Boorman's unmade screenplays, through to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and its musical counterpart. She also reviews over 50 years of "Hobbit Art", including the work of Alan Lee, John Howe, and Ted Nasmith. Journeying through fanzines, videogames, fanfiction, and more, Porter demonstrates how the hobbits, their characters, and their stories continue to introduce new audiences to Tolkien's work, in new and adapted forms.}}
