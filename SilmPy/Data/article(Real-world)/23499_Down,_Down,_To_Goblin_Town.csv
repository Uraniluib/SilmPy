'''Down, Down, To Goblin Town''' is the eighth track on ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]''. It is very similar to the more famous ''[[Where There's a Whip, There's a Way]]'', which was featured in the other [[Rankin/Bass]] film, ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''. It is based on the poem ''[[Clap! Snap! The black crack!]]'', which appears in the novel.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Crush, smack! Whip crack!
Smash, grab! Pinch, nab!
You go, my lad!
Ho, ho! my lad!

The black crack! the black crack!
The black crack! the black crack!
Down down to Goblin-town
Down down to Goblin-town
Down down to Goblin-town
You go, my lad!
Ho, ho! my lad!

Goblins quaff, and Goblins beat
Goblins laugh, and Goblins bleat
Batter, jabber, whip and hammer hoooooo!
You go, my lad!
Ho, ho! my lad!

Below, my lad!
Ho, ho! my lad!

The black crack! the black crack!
The black crack! the black crack!
Down, down to Goblin-town
Down, down to Goblin-town
Down, down to Goblin-town
You go, my lad!
Ho, ho! my lad!
