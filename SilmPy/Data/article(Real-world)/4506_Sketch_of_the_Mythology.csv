The '''Sketch of the Mythology''' is the 'first' version of [[The Silmarillion]], written in [[1926]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Originally written as an outline to explain the background to the alliterative '[[Children of Hurin|The Children of Hurin]]' to Tolkien's old tutor and friend [[R.W. Reynolds]], it later became the basis from which all work on the [[Legendarium]] derived.

While only 28 pages long, the narrative in the Sketch advances a great deal from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', approaching the final form in most respects, albeit extremely condensed. It was superseded by the [[Quenta Noldorinwa]] in 1930.
