==Summary==
Allen and Unwin proposed 20 October 1955 as the publication date for ''The Return of the King''.  Tolkien beseeched them not to fail; it was the last possible day since on the next day he had to deliver his first (overdue) Oâ€™Donnell Lecture.  He was hoping that a large part of the audience would sit up late reading the night before and thus not notice his grave lack of equipment as a lecturer on a Celtic subject.  He also wanted to allude to the book because his lecture talked about "Celticness" and its linguistic pattern.
