{{stub}}[[Image:Birmingham 1904.jpg|thumb|Edgbaston, Birmingham, a Birds' Eye View in 1904]]'''Birmingham''' is a city located in the West Midlands county in England. It was where [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] called home through most of his childhood from [[1895]]-[[1911]]. Tolkien's parents [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur]] and [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel]] came from this city.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 115-8</ref> Tolkien's experience of growing up and living in Birmingham had a huge impression on him and his life's work.<ref name=Council>Birmingham City Council, [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/tolkien J.

==Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham==
Tolkien was born in the [[Orange Free State]] in 1892. However in 1895 [[J.R.R. Tolkien|John]], his brother [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] and his mother [[Mabel Tolkien]] moved into a cottage in Sarehole, a village four miles from the centre of Birmingham. The green woods and fields of his new home had a huge affect on a Tolkien who had only ever known the hot and dry conditions of South Africa. Indeed Tolkien modelled his descriptions of [[The Shire]] on his memories of Sarehole. [[Sarehole Mill]] is quite possibly mentioned in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the 'the great mill'.<ref name=Council/>

Tolkien joined King Edward's School in September 1900. Over the next few years the family moved several times: first to Moseley in 1900; then to Westfield Road, King's Heath in March 1901; and finally to Oliver Road, Edgbaston in 1902. Following Mabel's conversion to Catholicism her family withdrew financial support prompting her to pull Tolkien out of King Edward's School. He and his brother were enrolled in the Oratory School, St Philips. Tolkien returned to King Edward's School in 1903 after winning a scholarship from the school. Before Mabel died in 1904 from diabetes, she appointed [[Francis Xavier Morgan|Father Francis Xavier Morgan]] to be John and [[Hilary Tolkien |Hilary's]] guardian.<ref name=Council/>
