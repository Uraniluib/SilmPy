==Summary==
Tolkien revealed that he had begun a story placed about 100 years after [[Sauron]]'s passing, but it proved both sinister and depressing.  In it men showed their quick satiety with good.  [[Gondorians]] in peacetime had become discontented and restless.  The dynasts descended from [[Aragorn]] would become just kings and governors â€“ like [[Denethor]] or worse.  The story told of an outcrop of revolutionary plots, a centre of secret Satanistic religion, and Gondorian boys playing at being [[Orcs]] and going around doing damage. Tolkien said he could have written a "thriller" about the plot, its discovery, and overthrow but that it was not worth doing.
