'''Ian Mune''' ([[1941]]) played a [[Shirriffs|bounder]] (specifically, the one whose head was cut off by a [[Nazg√ªl|Ringwraith]]) in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He also served as an additional second unit director; he describes one of his works as "[i]t was the bit where the hobbits were being dragged from the burning tavern by the orcs"<sup>[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/arts/titokowarufilm.htm]</sup>, which made it into the trailer for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. It is unclear as to what scene he is referring; no scene matching his description is in the trailer. He could be referring to a scene shot for the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] scene in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.

In June [[2007]], he and 14 other actors filed [http://us.imdb.com/news/ni0058227/ a lawsuit] against [[New Line Cinema]] over merchandising royalties.

It depended on how long you had to wear them for.''[...]''By the time it was all over my feet were awash, and so very, very sore.|Ian Mune, [http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/arts/titokowarufilm.htm Puke Ariki interview].
