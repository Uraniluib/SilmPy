'''''Tolkien och den svarta magin''''' (Swedish: ''Tolkien and the Black Magic'') is a Swedish-language book by [[Åke Ohlmarks]] which tells the story of an alleged moral detoriation of the Tolkien societies.

''*Note: The content of the book was heavily contested upon its publication. For more information on the dispute, see the biography of [[Åke Ohlmarks]].''

==From the back cover==

It has come to attention that, especially during the last years, the multitude of Tolkien societies (thousands in America, and not a few in Sweden) have degenerated to a kind of KU-KLUX-KLAN with a worship of open violence, crude orgies, alcohol and drug abuse. Murders have been commited, recurrent cases of assaults, kidnapping and desecrations of churches and sacraments.

Åke Ohlmarks, the man responsible for the translation and introduction of Tolkien in Sweden and who is also internationally recognized as one of the foremost experts on Tolkien, reveals in this uncanny book how far it has evolved even in our contry.
