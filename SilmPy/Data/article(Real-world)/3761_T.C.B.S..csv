'''T.C.B.S.''' is an acronym for '''Tea Club, Barrovian Society'''. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his friends at [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] met regularly at the Barrow Stores, which is where T.C.B.S. got their name.  The core members were considered to be the "big four" of Tolkien, [[Geoffrey Bache Smith]], [[Christopher Wiseman]], and [[Robert Gilson]].<ref>{{L|5}}</ref>

The friends continued to stay in contact with each other's literary work until [[1916]]. [[Sidney Barrowclough]] and the Payton brothers, [[Ralph Payton|Ralph]] and [[Wilfrid Payton|Wilfrid]], were younger than Tolkien and continued it for some time after they left.  

Almost all of them died in [[World War I]]. Of Tolkien's close personal friends, only [[Christopher Wiseman]] survived the war,<ref>{{L|350}}</ref> a fact which greatly affected him.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', passim.</ref>
