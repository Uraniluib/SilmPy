'''The Muster of Rohan (scene)''' is the twenty-seventh scene of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' and the thirty-fourth scene of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (extended edition)]]. It contains Rohan saddling up to ride to Gondor, Theoden, king of Rohan telling Merry that none of his riders can bear him, and that he can't fight in the upcoming battle, the lady of Rohan grabbing Merry and pulling him onto her horse, and finally the charge out of the forest and onto the plain, where there is a overhead shot of the horse-riders' great numbers.
