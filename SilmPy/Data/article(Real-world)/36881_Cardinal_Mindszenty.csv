'''"Cardinal Mindszenty"''' is the title of [[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]], co-signed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], sent to the editor of ''The Times'' (published on [[28 January]] [[1949]]; p. 5). The letter, written to protest against the arrest in 1949 of Cardinal [[Wikipedia:József Mindszenty|József Mindszenty]] of Hungary, is signed by the Honorary President and nine Honorary Vice Presidents (among which Tolkien is included) of [http://www.newman.org.uk/ the Newman Association].

The letter appears to have been largely unknown among Tolkien scholars, until it was discovered by [[Douglas A. Anderson]] in [[2011]]. Anderson comments that "''Tolkien's affiliation with the Newman Society was previously undocumented''", and finds it noteworthy that Tolkien during his busy 1940s managed to "''volunteer work for the Association devoted to John Henry Newman, founder of the [[Birmingham]] Oratory where Tolkien himself had been educated as a boy''".<ref>[[Douglas A. Anderson]], "[http://tolkienandfantasy.blogspot.com/2011/11/tolkien-and-newman-association.html Tolkien and the Newman Association]", dated 22 November 2011, at [http://tolkienandfantasy.blogspot.com/ TolkienandFantasy.blogspot.com] (accessed 23 November 2011)</ref>
