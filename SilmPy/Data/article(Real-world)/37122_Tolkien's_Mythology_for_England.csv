==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|Tolkien set out to create a mythology for England and the English but the popularity of his books and the recent films has spread across the English-speaking world and beyond.You will find here an outline of Tolkien's life and work. The main part of the book consists of an alphabetical subject entry which will help you gain a greater understanding of Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the creatures that inhabit it, and the languages they spoke. It will also give an insight into a culture and way-of-life that extolled values which are as valid today as they were over 1,000 years ago.This book focuses on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and shows how Tolkien's knowledge of Anglo-Saxon and Norse literature and history helped shape its plot and characters.|<ref>[http://www.asbooks.co.uk/ ASBooks.co.uk] (accessed 18 December 2011)</ref>}}
