'''The Space Trilogy''' is a series of novels by [[C.S. Lewis]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] friend and fellow [[Inklings|Inkling]]. 

The story of the first book, ''Out of the Silent Planet'', shares a common genesis with Tolkien's unfinished ''[[The Lost Road]]''. The two men had a conversation about the shortcomings of Science Fiction literature and Lewis remarked that "there is too little of what we really like in stories", suggesting they try their hand at the genre "as amateurs":<ref name="Letter294">{{L|294}}</ref>

Lewis' 'Space-journey' became ''Out of the Silent Planet'' and was published in [[1938]] by The Bodley Head. Lewis initially tried to interest [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] in the work, but despite the [[Letter 26|positive review]] Tolkien gave the publishers they passed.
==Elwin Ransom==
The protagonist of the trilogy is Elwin Ransom, and is apparently modelled in part on Tolkien (as well as Lewis himself and [[Charles Williams|other Inklings]]): he is a philologist at an Oxbridge university, has a special interest in languages (and it is men, fought in [[World War I]] and [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and his first name means "[[Elf-friend]]" (Elwin is the modern form of [[Ã†lfwine]]). Tolkien played down this similarity on multiple occasions, admitting it only in that both were philologists.<ref name="Letter24">{{L|24}}</ref><ref name="Letter77">{{L|27}}</ref>
