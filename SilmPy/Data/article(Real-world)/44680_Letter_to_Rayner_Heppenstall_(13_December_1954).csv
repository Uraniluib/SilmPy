*'''Contents:''' Critical points about the [[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son (radio play)|radio play ''The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth'']] (broadcast on [[3 December]]). While the letter has not been kept in the [[BBC]] Written Archives Centre, it can be inferred from Heppenstall's reply on the same day that Tolkien appears to have "included comments that the readers ignored the [[Wikipedia:Alliterative verse|alliterative metre]] of the work, and delivered the verse as if it were [[Wikipedia:Iambic pentameter|iambic pentameter]]".<ref name=CG/>
