==History==
[[Image:Danmarks Tolkienforening.jpg|<small>Announcement for Danmarks Tolkienforening, 1993</small>|thumb]]
Danmarks Tolkienforening was founded by [[Inge Søbæk]] and [[Lars-Terje Lysemose]], both members of [[The Tolkien Society]], on [[3 January|January 3]], [[1993]] in [[wikipedia:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. At the meeting, Lysemose was elected to be the editor for ''Athelas''.

At first unknown to Søbæk and Lysemose, another Danish Tolkien Sociey, named [[Tolkiens Følge]], had been founded in Roskilde on September 22, 1992. However, after learning about the aim of Tolkiens Følge, Søbæk and Lysemose wanted to be a more traditional litarary society for Tolkien enthusiasts, and so continued with their project.

Throughout Denmark, Danmarks Tolkienforening managed to arrange several lectures, concerts with music inspired by Tolkien and exhibitions with artists portraying the legendarium of Tolkien. Danmarks Tolkienforening also took part in the first Nordic Tolkien festival, held in 1994 in [[wikipedia:Uppsala|Uppsala]], Sweden.

In the summer of 1993, Tolkiens Følge merged with Danmarks Tolkienforening, and the new name became: Imladris - Danmarks Tolkienforening. However, missing the practise of parties and costumes, a group in Copenhagen detached and founded [[Bri, Tolkienselskabet i København]] in 1996.<ref>[[Lars-Terje Lysemose]], "[http://www.imladris.dk/?id=16&show=93 Historien om Imladris - Danmarks Tolkienforening (Den lange udgave) 11 September 2005]" ("The History of Imladris, the Tolkien Society of Denmark (The Long Story)", online article, as of July 22, 2010</ref>
