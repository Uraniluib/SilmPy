==Quotes==
{{quote|I mean what is Legolas but [[wikipedia:Bishounen|bishounen]] love? It gives the idea that, 'Hey! You can still be a man and dress well.' What a concept! The metrosexual or whatever they want to call it. It comes down to the fact that men can look good too.|Crispin Freeman, who also filled [[Orlando Bloom]]'s seat in "Pirates of the Caribbean" games.}}

{{quote|I actually got to work on one of the Lord of the Rings videogames, The War of The Ring, and I got to play Faramir, which was great, you know, I got to sit there yelling 'For Gondor!', 'Ithilien!', you know, and you've just gotta love that stuff, it's awesome.|Crispin Freeman, [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2005-11-06/interview-crispin-freeman ANN interview]}}
