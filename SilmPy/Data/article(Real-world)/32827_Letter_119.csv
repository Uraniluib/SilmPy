==Summary==
Tolkien declared that he did not have the time to retype ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham|Farmer Giles]]'' and did not think it necessary.  Typing a fair copy of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was a heavy labour; having it professionally typed was cost prohibitive.  However, he expected shortly to be granted a "sabbatical" after 25 years; if so he thought he could finish a few things.
