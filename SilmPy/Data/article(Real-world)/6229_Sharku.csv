'''Sharku''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. He was played by [[Jed Brophy]].

==History==
Sharku was one of the [[Wargs|Warg]]-riders who ambushed the column of [[Rohan]] women and children retreating from [[Edoras]] to the safety of [[Helm's Deep]]. [[Théoden]] and his guard, with the help of [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], fended off the attack. However, during the battle Aragorn got tangled in the harness of Sharku's Warg and both the beast and the ranger fell off a cliff. Sharku, mortally wounded, survived just long enough to gloat about Aragorn's (supposed) death to Legolas and Gimli.
==Etymology==
Sharku means "Old man" in [[Black Speech]].{{fact}}
