}}'''Lalaith''' ({{FA|466}} - {{FA|469}}), born '''Urwen''', was the second child of [[Húrin]] and [[Morwen]], sister of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] and [[Nienor]].<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 34</ref>

==History==
Urwen was a happy child and her parents gave her the [[epessë|nickname]] "Laughter" (''Lalaith''), from the nearby river, [[Nen Lalaith]]. She was three years old when she died of a plague sent out from [[Angband]]. Her death was especially hard on her older brother Túrin.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 40</ref>

== Etymology ==
Lalaith comes from the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[Lalaith (word)|lalaith]]'', meaning "laughter". Her birth name, Urwen, means "Fire Maiden" (from ''[[ûr]]'' = "fire, hot" and ''[[gwenn]]'' = "maiden").
