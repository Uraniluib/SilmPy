==Preface==
Tolkien had received the [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company's draft for dust-jacket blurbs for the American edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  He also was shown opinions of the book that [[Allen and Unwin]] planned for the jacket of the British edition.  [[C.S. Lewis]] compared the book favourably with [[Wikipedia:Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], [[Wikipedia:Richard Hughes (writer)|Richard Hughes]] put it on the same scale as ''[[Wikipedia:The Faerie Queene|The Faerie Queene]]'', and [[Naomi Mitchison]] called it "super science fiction".  [[Rayner Unwin]] also told Tolkien that his new son had been named Merlin, more appropriate than [[Gandalf]].
==Summary==
Tolkien said that the Americans were not very amenable to criticism, but he thought their effort so poor that he had to make some effort to improve it.  He had little hope of effect given the case of the appalling jacket they made for ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  He sent a page of suggestions to be forwarded.

Could they publish by July?  Tolkien wanted publication while there was still enthusiasm, and said that July was a good month for scholastics and academics who could lift their heads then before bowing them again in September.  He particularly wanted [[The Fellowship of the Ring|Volume I]] out in public before he went to Dublin on 20 July to take a degree.  He was also going to Liége on 2 October.

The preliminary opinions were pleasing, but comparisons with [[Wikipedia:Edmund Spenser|Spencer]], [[Wikipedia:Thomas Malory|Malory]], Ariosto, and super Science Fiction were too much for his vanity.  He showed the draft to [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey Reginald Gilchirst Mure|Geoffrey Mure]] (Warden of Merton) who was visibly shaken.  He said Merton seemed to be doing well, but did not think Tolkien was in the Roger Bannister class.<ref group="note">Bannister, a Merton College Senior Scholar, was the first to run a mile in under four minutes on 6 May 1954.</ref>  Still, Tolkien's stock went up, so much that instead of a threatened ejection from his room for a mere tutor he was put into an even better room, displacing the Steward.  Please, he asked, send more appreciations if Rayner had them; he promised to not become like Mr. Toad.

Rayner's son was the second Merlin he knew.  He was right to reject Gandalf, who was always old and got older before his task was done – not a name for a child of Men.
