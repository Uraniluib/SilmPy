Sometime between [[14 January]] [[1956]] and [[2 April]] [[1958]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to Peter Alford'''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2001/valuable-printed-books-and-manuscripts-l01321/lot.550.html|articlename=Tolkien, J.R.R. Fine group of four autograph letters signed to Peter Alford|dated=31 Dec 2001|website=Sotheby's|accessed=16 Apr 2017}}</ref>

*'''Notes:''' While Tolkien's other three known letters to Mr Alford can be dated,<ref>{{CG|C}}, pp. 484, 485, 523</ref> the date of this fourth letter has not been revealed.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=72200|articlename=Valuable Printed Books and Manuscripts. 2001|dated=|website=TB|accessed=26 May 2014}}</ref> [[Anders Stenström|Beregond, Anders Stenström]] noted an Elvish passage in one of the letters in this group (and none of the other letters appear to fit the description): "''Another letter'' [among Sotheby's 14 actual Tolkien items to be auctioned by on December 13] ''(to Peter Alford, from the years 1956-58) provides a lengthy discussion of the Elvish greeting: Elen síla lúmenn' ómentielmo. One thing attracts our attention: Tolkien explains the pronominal possessive suffix -lma as a variety of -lme 'we' which in fact means: 'you and I/we'. The [[Quenya]] verb [[sil|sil-]] 'shine white' is derived - according to this letter - from the stem ÞIL-''."<ref>[[Elfling]], message from [[Anders Stenström|Beregond, Anders Stenström]]. R.D. (no longer available online)</ref>
*'''Publication:''' Excerpts were published in ''[[Sotheby's Valuable Printed Books and Manuscripts 13 December 2001]]''.
