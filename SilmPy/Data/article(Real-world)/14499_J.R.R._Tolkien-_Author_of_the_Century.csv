==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|Recent polls have consistently declared that J.R.R. Tolkien is "the most influential author of the century" and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is "the book of the century." In support of these claims, Tom Shippey, the prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy, now presents us with a fascinating companion to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, focusing in particular on ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<br/><br/>The core of the book consists of three chapters that examine ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a linguistic and cultural map, as a twisted web of story, and as a response to the meaning of myth. Shippey presents a unique argument to explain the nature of evil and gives readers a compelling insight into the complicated interweaving of many strands as the narrative moves between characters and into the remarkable skill behind the construction of such a rich and complex story. Other chapters examine ''The Hobbit'', explaining the hobbits' anachronistic relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth; the fundamental importance of ''The Silmarillion'' to Tolkien's canon; and an illuminating look at ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'', and other lesser-known works in connection to Tolkien's life.<br/><br/>With a clear and accessible style, Shippey offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature. He demonstrates how ''The Hobbit'', ''The Lord of the Rings'', and ''The Silmarillion'' form part of a live and continuing tradition of storytelling that can trace its roots back through Grimms' ''Fairy Tales'' to ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''. ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' not only gives readers a deeper understanding of Tolkien and his work, but also serves as a learned and entertaining introduction to some of the finest and most influential works of fantasy ever written.}}
