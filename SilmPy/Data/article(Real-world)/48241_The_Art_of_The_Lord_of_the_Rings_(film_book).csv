In addition, the book includes 100 unpublished artworks from the extended Directorâ€™s cuts of the three films, and digital imagery and designs not available when the first books were published.Printed on high-quality art paper, this lavish book is ideal for Tolkien collectors, film enthusiasts and art students and finally allows the massive undertaking of making ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy to be fully appreciated.}}
