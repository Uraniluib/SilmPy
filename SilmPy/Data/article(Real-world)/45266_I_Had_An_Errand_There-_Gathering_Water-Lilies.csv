'''I Had An Errand There: Gathering Water-Lilies ''' is one of the songs sung by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref>

==The poem==
<poem>
''I had an errand there: gathering [[Water-lilies|water-lilies]],''
''green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,''
''the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,''
''to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted.''
''Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,''
''in a wide pool, deep and clean, far down [[Withywindle]];''
''there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.''
''By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,''
''fair young [[Goldberry]] sitting in the rushes.''
''Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!''
<br>
''And that proved well for you- for now I shall no longer''
''go down deep again along the forest-water,''
''not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing''
''[[Old Man Willow]]'s house this side of spring-time,''
''not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter''
''dances down the withy-path too bathe in the water.''
