'''The Bath Song''' was a song sung by [[Peregrin Took]] in [[Crickhollow]] while he, [[Samwise Gamgee]], and [[Frodo Baggins]] were bathing after their long journey from [[Hobbiton]]. The song was also one of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s favorites.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>

==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Sing hey! for the bath at close of day 
that washes the weary mud away! 
A loon is he that will not sing: 
O! Water Hot is a noble thing! 

O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, 
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; 
but better than rain or rippling streams 
is Water Hot that smokes and steams. 

O! Water cold we may pour at need 
down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; 
but better is Beer if drink we lack, 
and Water Hot poured down the back. 

O! Water is fair that leaps on high 
in a fountain white beneath the sky; 
but never did fountain sound so sweet 
as splashing Hot Water with my feet!
</poem>
