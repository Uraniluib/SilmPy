'''Samwise "Sam" Gamgee''' (6 April {{TA|2980}}<ref group="note">In the second edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Sam's year of birth was added to ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]''; it was, however, {{TA|2983}}. This contradicts both the ''[[Longfather Tree of Master Samwise]]'' and a later entry in ''The Tale of Years''. The incorrect date has been corrected in the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th anniversary edition]]. See also ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 716.</ref> - {{FoA|61}}; [[Shire Reckoning]]: 1380 - 1482; 102 years old when he sailed into the [[Aman|West]]) was [[Frodo Baggins]]' servant and the only original member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to remain with him till the very end of the journey to [[Mount Doom]].

== History ==
He lived with his father, [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]], better known as "The Gaffer", on [[Bagshot Row]] in [[the Shire]], close to [[Bag End]]. Sam's mother was [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]]; he had five siblings: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]].

A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of plain speech. However, his love for [[Elves]], his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of (all nurtured by his tutor [[Bilbo Baggins]]) set him apart from the beginning.

Sam was one of the "[[Conspirators]]" who were summoned by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] in order to watch over [[Frodo Baggins]] and the [[The One Ring|Ring]] inherited by Frodo from Bilbo. Being the closest to Frodo, Sam was their "chief investigator" who eavesdropped on his talks with [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|Wizard]].<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>

On [[13 April]], when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is [[Sauron]]'s One Ring, they noticed Sam eavesdropping. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity.  As "punishment", Sam was made Frodo's first companion on his journey to [[Bree]] and [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> Sam and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] followed Frodo to his new house at [[Crickhollow]] where his and the Conspirators' role was revealed. Merry joined the travelers on their way to Bree. They passed through the [[Old Forest]], the [[Barrow-downs]] and [[the Prancing Pony]] at Bree where they were joined by "[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]". [[Sauron]]'s spies had opened the stables of the inn and all the mounts went loose, therefore before leaving the village, the company purchased a [[Ponies|pony]] from [[Bill Ferny]]. Sam loved and tended the animal, and named him [[Bill the Pony|Bill]], after his owner.

When they reached [[Rivendell]], Sam was beside Frodo's bed while he was recovering from the [[Morgul-wound]] he was inflicted on [[Weathertop]]. Sam also was caught eavesdropping on the [[Council of Elrond]] and insisted that he accompany Frodo on his [[Quest of the Ring|quest to destroy the Ring]]. 

In [[Lothlórien]], [[Galadriel]] [[Gifts of Galadriel|gave]] Sam a [[Sam's garden box|box]] containing earth from her orchard.

After the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Sam was the only member of the Fellowship to remain with Frodo.
When [[Gollum]] joined up with them, Sam remained distrustful of his loyalty to Frodo, and treated him with disdain, and partially (though unintentionally) pushed Gollum to betray Frodo in [[Shelob's Lair]].    
[[File:John Howe - Sam and Shelob.jpg|thumb|[[John Howe]] - ''Sam and Shelob'']]
After [[Shelob]] attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring, intending to complete the quest, but upon learning that Frodo still lived, he rescued him from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and returned the Ring to him. Because he held the Ring for a time, he is considered one of the [[Ring-bearers]].

Together, Sam and Frodo crossed [[Mordor]] to [[Mount Doom]]. Sam himself carrying Frodo up the slope for part of the way. After the destruction of the Ring, both Sam and Frodo were honored by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for their deeds. 
 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Sam and Rosie Cotton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Sam and Rosie Cotton'']]
After the [[War of the Ring]], and the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of Galadriel's soil at the root of each. He planted a silver nut in the [[Party Field]] where [[the Party Tree]] had once been, and the nut grew into a [[Mallorn]] tree. 

He married [[Rose Cotton|Rose "Rosie" Cotton]]. In honor for restoring the Shire his family was given the name [[Gardner Family|Gardner]]. 

They had thirteen children: [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor the Fair]], [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]], [[Rose Gardner|Rose]], [[Merry Gardner|Merry]], [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]], [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]], [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]], [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]], [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]], [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]], [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]], [[Robin Gardner|Robin]], and [[Tolman Gardner|Tolman]]. When Frodo sailed on the [[White Ship]], at the end of the Third Age, Sam inherited Bag End and was entrusted the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].

After [[Will Whitfoot]] resigned his post as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (the largest town in the Shire and the "unofficial capital"), in {{FoA|6}}, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive 7-year terms.

After his wife died in {{FoA|61}}, Sam entrusted the Red Book to Elanor and, according to her, he went to the [[Grey Havens]] to sail across the Sea and be reunited with Frodo in the [[Undying Lands]].

==Etymology==
Samwise means "simple minded" or "half-minded". Gamgee is a corruption of the name [[Gammidgy]], a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the [[Westron]] form of Sam's name '''[[Banazîr]] [[Galbasi]]''' (''also spelled Banazîr Galpsi'') (q.v. for more information).<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

Tolkien's English translation, ''Samwís Gamwich'', could have come to ''Samwise Gamgee'' in modern English.

The [[Sindarin]] version of Samwise is '''[[Perhael]]'''.

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] took the name from ''Gamgee Tissue'', a surgical dressing invented by a 19th century [[Birmingham]] surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee. "Gamgee" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool. Here, Tolkien describes why he had chosen that name for his character:
{{quote|The choice of Gamgee was primarily directed by alliteration; but I did not invent it. It was caught out of childhood memory, as a comic word or name. It was in fact the name when I was small (in Birmingham) for 'cotton-wool'. (Hence the association of the Gamgees with the Cottons.) I knew nothing of its origin.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}

It is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee (who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham Medical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in ''The Lord of the Rings'' but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:
{{quote|Dear Mr. Gamgee,<p>It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment when I saw your signature! I can only say, for your comfort, I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic. So that perhaps you will not be displeased at the coincidence of the name of this imaginary character of supposedly many centuries ago being the same as yours.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 184]]}}

He proceeded to send Mr Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's mind, as he recorded in his journal: 
{{quote|For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''}}

==In other stories==
In the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', the local police officer is a Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] who - at the behest of [[Gaffer Gamgee]] - seeks to lock up Mr Bliss as a thief for failing to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named Sam.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 62</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Samwise is first found in Rivendell, preparing for the departure. Later, he is found on [[Cerin Amroth]] in Lothlorien, alongside Frodo. The game's "Guardian" class ("Tank" in MMO terms) is based on Samwise due to the dedication he showed Frodo. This leads to an interesting occurrence: at some point each player gets to talk to a major character, who inspired his class. But while Legolas can teach a lot to a Hunter and Bilbo can show much to a Burglar, Sawmwise insists that he is no Guardian and not fit to be one - because his heroic deeds have not happened yet. The player has to double-check and discovers that whoever talked of Sam as a great Guardian, apparently had misheard the word "Gardener".

== Commentary ==
Sam Gamgee is by many regarded as the "true hero" of Tolkien's story. Tolkien himself expressed this view in one of his letters: Sam is referred to as the "chief hero", and special emphasis is placed on Sam's "rustic love" for Rosie.<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> The quest to destroy the Ring only succeeds because of Sam, who repeatedly saves Frodo from disaster (such as rescuing him at [[Cirith Ungol]] and carrying him up [[Mount Doom]]). He was one of only two Ring-bearers strong enough to surrender the Ring voluntarily.

The relationship between Frodo and Sam is, in many respects, at the center of ''The Lord of the Rings''. To the modern reader, it seems archaic, as it is extremely class-oriented.  Sam's humbleness and "plain speaking" is frequently emphasised in contrast to Frodo's "gentility", and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him "Mister Frodo" or "Master".  At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death. 

[[Tolkienists]] regard Sam as Frodo's ''[[wikipedia:Batman (army)|batman]]''. In the British Army, a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I First World War]) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman &mdash; he runs errands for Frodo, he cooks, he transports him (or at least carries him), and he carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:
{{quote|My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflexion of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}

Compare to the relation between [[wikipedia:Don_Quixote|Don Quixote]] and his squire [[wikipedia:Sancho Panza|Sancho Panza]], and the gradual "Quixotization" of Sancho.
