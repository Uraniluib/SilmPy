'''''Hazards of the Harad Wood''''' is an adventure module for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'', 1st Edition.

== Cover/Jacket Text ==

Four low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

Secrets lurk within Far Harad's Vale of Tears, mysteries that remain hidden for centuries. For the rural folk who dwell in the scrublands at the forest's edge, these enigmas can spell misfortune... or disaster. The lush beauty of Suza Sumar unveils forgotten horrors all too often. 

Inexplicable floating points of luminescence plague the village of Avashar. Can you discover the secret behind ''The Lights of Avashar''? 

Barthanan, a shepherd dwelling in the Scrublands, is losing sheep from his flock. No predators or signs of a struggle have been spotted. Can you solve the mystery of ''The Disappearing Flock''? 

Janir, a trapper who frequents the Suza Sumar, falls victim to nightmares after stumbling across a ruined keep. Will you risk insanity to stop a Demon's triumph in ''The Terror in the Jungle''? 

Manari Akajhi, a young scholar, is tracing his family's lineage in search of a suitable resting place for his dead father. Unfortunately, his newly discovered heritage has drawn the powerful Storm King's attention. Will you oppose the Nazg√ªl to prevent his capture in ''The Eyes of the Dragon''?

Confront Wild Men, Baricha, Demons, and Desert Screamers when you face the ''Hazards of the Harad Wood'' in these four exciting adventures.
