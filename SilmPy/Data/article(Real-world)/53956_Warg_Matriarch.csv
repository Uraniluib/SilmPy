The '''Warg Matriarch''' was a Gundabad [[Wargs|warg]] and the steed of [[Azog]] in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film trilogy]]. She is portrayed as a giant white warg, and according to the creators of the films, she is the mother of the other [[Gundabad]] wargs seen in films. She and Azog are shown to get along quite well, as Azog can be seen stroking her in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', and feeding her in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.

==History==
The first appearance of the Warg Matriarch was when [[Yazneg]] and [[Fimbul]] return to [[Weathertop]] to report their failure in capturing [[Thorin and Company]]. Azog rides her in all three ''The Hobbit'' films, and she even accompanies her master to [[Dol Guldur]]. She is last seen when Azog is leading an orc army towards [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. It is unclear if she survives the [[Battle of Five Armies]] or not.
