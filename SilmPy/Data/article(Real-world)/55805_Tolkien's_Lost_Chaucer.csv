'''''Tolkien's Lost Chaucer''''' is a forthcoming book featuring [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s unfinished and formerly [[Index:Unpublished material|unpublished]] manuscript concerning the "[[Clarendon Chaucer]]".

==From the publisher==

''Tolkien's Lost Chaucer'' uncovers the story of an unpublished and previously unknown book by the author of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien worked between 1922 and 1928 on his Clarendon edition ''Selections from Chaucer's Poetry and Prose'', and though never completed, its 160 pages of commentary reveals much of his thinking about language and storytelling when he was still at the threshold of his career as an epoch-making writer of fantasy literature. Drawing upon other new materials such as his edition of the ''Reeve's Tale'' and his Oxford lectures on the ''Pardoner's Tale'', this book reveals Chaucer as a major influence upon Tolkien's literary imagination.<ref>{{webcite|author=Tom Tivnan|articleurl=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tolkiens-Lost-Chaucer-John-Bowers/dp/0198842678/|articlename=Tolkien's Lost Chaucer|dated=|website=AMUK|accessed=20 February 2019}}</ref>
