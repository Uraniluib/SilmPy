== Summary ==

In this letter, Tolkien discussed the illustrations for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[Mr Bliss]]''. In the latter case [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] had requested that the lavish illustrations be simplified for production. Tolkien expressed surprise that the book and its illustrations are "worth so much trouble" but endeavoured to fit the work in around his research. As it transpired he never found the time, and ''Mr Bliss'' was only published posthumously in 1982 with the original pictures.<ref name="TLib">Tolkien Library, ''[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/Celebrating-Mr.Bliss.htm Mr. Bliss, a tale written and illustrated by Tolkien: 25th anniversary of publication]''. Last updated 2007-06-27. Retrieved 2010-07-05.</ref> The illustrations for ''The Hobbit'' sent in [[Letter 9]] on the other hand had been accepted, and Tolkien instructed the publisher on where they should be placed.
