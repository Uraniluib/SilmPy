<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
In the middle of the earth in the land of [[the Shire]]
lives a brave little [[Hobbits|hobbit]] whom we all admire.
With his long wooden [[pipe-weed|pipe]],
fuzzy, woolly toes,
he lives in a [[Smials|hobbit-hole]] and everybody knows him.

Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
He's only three feet tall
Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
The bravest little hobbit of them all.

Now hobbits are peace-lovin' folks you know
They're never in a hurry and they take things slow
They don't like to travel away from home
They just like to eat and be left alone
But one day Bilbo was asked to go
on a big adventure to the caves below,
to help [[Thorin and Company|some dwarves]] get back their gold
that was stolen by a [[Smaug|dragon]] in the days of old.

Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
He's only three feet tall
Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
The bravest little hobbit of them all.

Well, he fought the [[Orcs|goblins]]
He battled a [[Trolls|troll]]!
He riddled with [[Gollum]]!
A [[The One Ring|magic ring]] he stole!
He was chased by [[Wargs|wolves]],
Lost in the [[Mirkwood|forest]],
Escaped in a barrel from the [[Thranduil|elf-king]]'s halls.

Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
The bravest little hobbit of them all.

Now he's back in [[Bag End|his home]] in the land of the Shire,
that brave little hobbit whom we all admire,
just sittin' on a treasure of silver and gold,
puffin' on his pipe in his hobbit-hole.

Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
He's only three feet tall
Bilbo (Bilbo)
Bilbo Baggins
The bravest little hobbit of them all.
