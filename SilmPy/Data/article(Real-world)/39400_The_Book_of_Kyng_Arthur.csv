==From the Prologue==

"...I once told Professor J.R.R. Tolkien with great smugness that I was sure, judging from the great number of foreshadowing passages in the early parts of ''The Lord of the Rings'', that he had had the whole narrative in mind before he set pen to paper. Tolkien immediately informed me in no uncertain terms that he had rewritten the first section of the work in the light of it conclusion not once but many times and that it had been a very difficult job indeed." (p. xxix)
