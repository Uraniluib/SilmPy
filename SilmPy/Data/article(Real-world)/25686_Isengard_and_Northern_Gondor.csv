The citadel of Isengard was built by the Númenórians in a sheltered valley at the southern limits of the Misty Mountains. Its main purpose was to defend the gap of Calenardhon and the Fords of Isen against attacks by Sauron's forces. Self-sufficient and enchanted, it later became the virtually impregnable fortress of Saruman the White. No spire in Middle-earth was stronger, save the Dark Tower of Mordor.

*8 FULL-COLOR PAGES: a 2-page regional map, maps of Calmirië (Aldburg) and Dunlostir , plus 4 pages on the Tower of Orthanc

*THE FORTRESS OF ISENGARD: one of the greatest architectural creations in all of Middle-earth
