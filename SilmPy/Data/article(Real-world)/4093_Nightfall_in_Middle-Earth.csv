'''''Nightfall in Middle-Earth''''' is an album by [[Blind Guardian]] that was released in [[1998]].

The album is a concept album based on the [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] book ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Many of the tracks from the album are not complete songs, but are merely narratives to further the story. Blind Guardian owes many of its lyrics to Tolkien's work, but this album is exclusively dedicated to ''The Silmarillion''. The lyrics range from the quest for the [[Silmarils]] until the dawn of the [[Third Age]].

"Nightfall in Middle-Earth" was the first album Blind Guardian released in the United States. The result was so positive that Century Media started to release old Blind Guardian hits in the U.S. (records such as "Follow the Blind" and "Battalions of Fear").{{fact}}

The track "Mirror Mirror" is included in ''Blind DVD: Imaginations Through The Looking Glass''. This DVD was rated by many different music-specialized sites as "a masterpiece".{{fact}}

#In "Nightfall", Fëanor and his seven sons mourn the destruction wrought by Morgoth, including the slaying of Finwë, Fëanor's father, and swear to get revenge on him, in spite to the Valar's disapproval.
#"The Minstrel" is most likely about Maglor, son of Fëanor, who composed the song "The Fall of the Noldor" based on the Kinslaying.

#In "Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)", Fingolfin recounts his Noldor army's passage from the icy waste of Helcaraxë and the prophecy by Mandos about the Noldor's fate; he reflects on his own and his people's guilt and foreshadows their ultimate defeat.
#"The Battle of Sudden Flame" talks about the battle in which Morgoth breaks the Siege of Angband using his Balrogs and dragons.
