Tolkien.<br/><br/>''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' brings to an epic conclusion the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and the Company of Dwarves.

==Plot==
[[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] watch from the [[Lonely Mountain]] as the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] destroys [[Lake-town]]. [[Bard]] breaks out of prison and kills Smaug with the [[Black Arrow]] (brought to him by his son [[Bain]]), whose falling body crushes the fleeing [[Master of Lake-town]]. Bard - chosen as the new leader - and the people of Lake-town seek refuge in the ruins of [[Dale]]. Upon learning of her banishment from the [[Woodland Realm]], [[Tauriel]] travels to investigate [[Gundabad]] with [[Legolas]] (having previously tracked [[Bolg]] there).

Upon arriving at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Bofur]], and [[Óin]] are informed by Bilbo that [[Thorin]] has been inflicted with Smaug's "dragon sickness" as he searched for the [[Arkenstone]]. It is revealed that Bilbo actually stole the Arkenstone from Smaug, but knows it should be hidden from Thorin, who orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain be sealed off.

Meanwhile, having become a prisoner in [[Dol Guldur]], [[Gandalf]] is saved by [[Galadriel]]. She carries an unconscious Gandalf into a more open area while being taunted by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. [[Elrond]], [[Saruman]], and [[Radagast]] arrive to help rescue the Grey [[Wizards|Wizard]]. Gandalf is saved by Galadriel and given to Radagast while Elrond and Saruman hold off the [[Nazgûl]]. [[Sauron]] appears to them with the Nine at his side. Using the power of [[Nenya]] and her [[Phial of Galadriel|Phial]], Galadriel takes on the Dark Lord and the Ringwraiths, banishing them out of the fortress. Galadriel falls back fainting as Elrond supports her, realizing she has used her full strength in order to cast him away. Though Elrond believes they must warn the [[Free peoples]] of the enemy's return, Saruman tells him to take Galadriel to safety while he deals with Sauron.

Radagast provides Gandalf a horse and his staff before riding to Dale. At that time, [[Azog]] the Defiler approaches the Lonely Mountain with his vast [[Orcs|Orc]] army while learning from Bolg that an [[Elves|Elf]] army under the lead of [[Thranduil]] is also approaching. Azog tells Bolg to head to Gundabad and ready their other army. Following Bolg to the fortress of Gundabad, Legolas and Tauriel see Bolg with another army of Orcs and hundreds of war-bred [[bats]]. They decide to return to Lake-town to warn the others.

When Thranduil's army arrives in Dale, he forges an allegiance with Bard to claim a necklace of white gems from Thorin's treasure. Though Bard attempts to reason with Thorin to avoid further bloodshed, the stubborn [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] refuses to listen, much to his Company's dismay. As they prepare for the battle, Thorin gives Bilbo a ''[[mithril]]'' [[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|vest]]. Thorin begins to talk like Smaug, telling Bilbo that he will never share the treasure with Bard and Thranduil, not wanting to part with a single coin.

After Gandalf arrives at Dale, Bilbo sneaks out of the Lonely Mountain to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard. Inside the camp, Thranduil reminds Gandalf that he is the one who started all this and he will finish it. The next day, the Elf army and the armed people of Lake-town gather at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain to confront the Dwarves. Thranduil and Bard ride at the front, where Thorin threatens to kill them if they get any closer. Bard unveils the Arkenstone at the gates of Erebor and Thorin learns of Bilbo's actions and almost kills the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]. Luckily, Gandalf approaches at the front with Bard and Thranduil, telling Thorin that Bilbo is his to keep. The other Dwarves hold back their leader so Bilbo can escape down the wall to Gandalf. Then, a Dwarf company under [[Dáin Ironfoot]] arrives and attacks the Elves, but Azog's Orc army unexpectedly arrives through underground tunnels created by [[were-worms]]. 

Thus, the Battle of the Five Armies begins as Azog sends one half of his army to attack the Lonely Mountain with Dáin's force defending it. While Thranduil assists Dáin, Azog sends the rest of his forces to attack Dale with Bilbo, Gandalf, Bard, and the other Elves coming to its defense. Gandalf, Thranduil, Bard, and Dain do the best they can to hold off the Orc armies as more and more come, killing more Dwarves, [[Men]], and Elves. Meanwhile, [[Alfrid]] takes a pile of treasure and hides in an abandoned catapult, which flings him into a troll's mouth, killing both of them.

Inside the Lonely Mountain, Thorin eventually overcomes his madness after a lengthy hallucination. Thorin and Company burst out of the Mountain and join the battle, much to Dáin's delight. While the others aid what remains of Dáin's forces, Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli ride to Ravenhill in a Dwarven chariot, killing numerous Orcs, [[Wargs]] and [[Trolls]] in the process. At the same time, Legolas and Tauriel set off for Ravenhill with Bilbo following to warn the Dwarves of the second Orc army. Azog captures Fíli and stabs him in the back before throwing him off of a cliff. Bilbo is knocked out, while Bolg stabs Kíli in the chest. After Legolas kills Bolg, the Great [[Eagles]] arrive, led by Radagast and [[Beorn]], to assist in the battle, quickly decimating the Orc army. When Bilbo regains consciousness, he finds that Thorin has killed Azog but was mortally wounded in the process and dies soon after making his peace with the Hobbit. Sometime after, a disillusioned Legolas decides to leave his father's Realm. Thranduil urges him to go North to meet with one of the [[Dúnedain]], a Man who goes by the name of [[Strider (Aragorn)|"Strider"]]. Thranduil, after seeing Tauriel kiss Kíli's dead body, finally accepts Tauriel's love for Kíli and agrees with her plan to bury the Dwarf.

Bilbo bids farewell to the surviving members of Thorin's Company, telling them they are welcome to join him for tea whenever they are in [[the Shire]], to which he returns with Gandalf. As they part on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf reveals that he knows of the [[The One Ring|Ring]] that Bilbo found in the Goblin tunnels (though unaware that it was the One Ring) before they part ways on good terms. Bilbo's story ends when he returns to [[Bag End]] and finds the townspeople are auctioning off his belongings and are about to sell his house. The scene transitions to Bilbo on the day of his 111th birthday when he receives a visit from Gandalf, ending where ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' begins.

==Deviations from the source material==
''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' covers the final seven chapters of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' with a few elements added from the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. While it generally follows the story, a number of liberties were still taken:

*There is no [[Thrushes|thrush]] telling [[Bard]] of [[Smaug]]'s weak point while trying to kill him (having been replaced by the legend that [[Girion]] had loosened a scale on the [[Dragons|Dragon]]'s breast in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|previous film]]). Also, his son [[Bain]] assists Bard by bringing him the last [[Black Arrow]].
*Smaug directly confronts Bard after several of the Bowman's arrows deflect his hide, whereas the Dragon was unaware of him and was shot down while airborne in the book.
*The [[Master of Lake-town]] dies by Smaug falling on his boat while trying to escape [[Lake-town]] instead of starvation in the desert.
*The storyline concerning [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]] (who is an original character) both riding to [[Gundabad]] where they discover a second Orc army - led by [[Bolg]] - is headed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] (along with thousands of [[bats]]) is invented for the film. It's this army that is designated as the fifth army in the film's eponymous battle instead of the [[Wargs|Warg]] army, as in the book.
*Also at Gundabad, Legolas divulges to Tauriel that his mother had been killed there, though there is never any mention of her in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] writings.
*As all of the members of [[Thorin and Company]] reached the [[Lonely Mountain]] together in the first place; in the books, [[Óin]], [[Bofur]], [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] are not later coming to the Mountain alone.
*[[Galadriel]] does not free [[Gandalf]] in [[Dol Guldur]] in the books, as he never got captured in them, and he is not told to be too weak to actively participate in the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]]. Also, the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] shows an Orc attempting to take [[Narya]] from Gandalf at Sauron's command, although Sauron never exactly knew where the [[Three Rings]] were or who carried them. Furthermore, it is said that only [[Ring-bearers]] are able to see the Rings while they are worn by other Ring-bearers.
*In the books, there is no hint that the [[Nazgûl]] were present during the Attack on Dol Guldur launched by the [[White Council]]. 
*Sauron says "The [[Angmar|Kingdom of Angmar]] [shall] rise," yet the source material gives no hint that Sauron intended to restore the Kingdom of Angmar. 
*In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf points out at the [[Council of Elrond]] that the victory was thanks to the devices of [[Saruman]]. In this film, however, it is chiefly Galadriel who expels [[Sauron]] with her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]].
*The members of the White Council don't realize that Sauron has returned until they encounter him in Dol Guldur, but the books have Gandalf tell the other members this fact already 90 years prior to the Attack on Dol Guldur.
*In the Extended Edition, Radagast gives his staff to Gandalf, since Sauron destroyed Gandalf's staff in their fight in the previous film.
*[[Thranduil]] wishes to claim a particular Elven necklace of white gems from the [[Lonely Mountain]]. It is revealed that they were originally for his wife (a point which is invented for the film).
*When Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor at night in the film's Extended Edition, [[Bofur]] is at watch instead of [[Bombur]]. Bilbo does not offer to relieve Bofur, but Bofur rather appears to somewhat understand Bilbo's motives and knowingly lets him go.
*Gandalf says that Sauron wants to conquer the Lonely Mountain because of its "strategic position." In the books, Gandalf indeed fears that Sauron could ally with the Dragon, but the [[Dark Lord]] isn't concerned with the [[Battle of Five Armies]] or Erebor.
*[[Azog]] isn't present at this point in the books, as he was killed during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]].
*The huge animals called "[[Were-worms]]," which burrow tunnels to Erebor through which the [[Orcs|Orc]] armies travel, never appear in that capacity in any of Tolkien's writings.
*The Orcs have a watchtower on [[Ravenhill]] - which is overseen by Azog - that gives semaphore signals to the rest of the army.
*Instead of a red axe, [[Dáin Ironfoot]] wields a red war hammer.
*Since [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] is unconscious for most of the battle in the book and Tolkien offers only a few retrospective details of what happened, most things in the film's battle are invented, such the presence of [[Trolls]], [[Ogres]], war machinery, and battle rams.
*At one point in the battle, the women of Lake-town decide to take up arms and fight alongside the men.
*Instead of dying while defending their mortally wounded uncle, Fíli and Kíli are slain by Azog and Bolg, respectively, on Ravenhill before [[Thorin]] ever receives such injury.
*Legolas returns [[Orcrist]] to Thorin during the battle by throwing it at (and stabbing) an Orc that Thorin was combating at that moment. In the book, it is in Thranduil's keeping until he lays it on Thorin's tomb at his funeral.
*Instead of [[Beorn]] killing Bolg, it is Legolas who does so.
*Thorin kills Azog after the Pale Orc mortally wounds him.
*Thorin dies on Ravenhill without Beorn ever taking him to safety (though he still makes peace with Bilbo before doing so).
*When Legolas informs his father he will not be returning to [[Mirkwood]], Thranduil urges him to find a [[Men|Man]] known as [[Strider (Aragorn)|"Strider"]]. Thranduil had little to nothing to do with the [[Rangers of the North]] in the books, and, during the events of ''The Hobbit'', Aragorn is a mere 10 years old in [[legendarium]] (but was said to be 87 in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' due to the omission of the 17-year gap between [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] and Gandalf's return to [[the Shire]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'').
*As in the 1977 [[Rankin/Bass]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated film]], most of Bilbo's return journey is omitted, as is Gandalf and [[Balin]]'s subsequent visit to [[Bag End]] years later. The scene of Bilbo's belongings being auctioned off upon his return, however, remains.
*The film ends with a callback to Gandalf's arrival at Bag End for Bilbo's Farewell Party at the beginning of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring''.
