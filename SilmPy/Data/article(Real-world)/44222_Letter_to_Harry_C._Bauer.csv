*'''Subject:''' Tolkien thanks Bauer for an article or reprint Bauer had sent him. While the text Bauer sent is unknown, [[John D. Rateliff]] has noted that "it must have had something to do with the work of [[Wikipedia:Sinclair Lewis|Sinclair Lewis]], since Tolkien immediately segues into saying that he is now inclined to think that the word ''[[Hobbits|hobbit]]'' owes something to Lewis's [[Wikipedia:Babbitt (novel)|''Babbitt'']]". Tolkien also states in the letter that "he read all of Sinclair Lewis" (apparently referring to Lewis's famous books).<ref name=Sac/>
