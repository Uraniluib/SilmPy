'''''Here, There Be Dragons''''' is the first book in the fantasy series ''[[The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica]]'', a fictional story involving John ([[J.R.R. Tolkien]]), Charles ([[Charles Williams]]), and Jack ([[C.S. Lewis]], who never really liked the name Clive).

==Editorial review==

The unusual murder of an Oxford professor brings together three strangers in World War I London: John, a soldier and the professor's correspondence student; Jack, a young Oxford student; and Charles, an editor at the Oxford University Press. One rainy night they meet a curious man called Bert who tells them that they are the caretakers of the Imaginarium Geographica, an atlas of imaginary lands. Forced to flee in Bert's ship, the group sails to the Archipelago of Dreams, where a battle over Arthur Pendragon's throne threatens to place the evil Winter King in charge. Owen brings together elements from well-known works of fantasy and legend: the lands and characters lean heavily toward Greek and Arthurian myth, while clues from the caretakers' works point to the legendary writers they will become, and the characters they will write about. The episodic plot is perfectly played out, there's action at every point, and Owen's amazingly detailed pen-and-ink illustrations, dark and atmospheric, lend a real storybook flavor. This is the first volume in the Chronicles of Imaginarium Geographica series, welcome to an unforgettable ride.
