<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
I've seen the moon 
And the first sunrise 
I'll leave it to the memories 
And kiss the wind goodbye 

For the Eldar 
I'm trapped inside this dream 
Of the Eldar's 
Song of doom 

I've tasted poison 
When I drank the wine of fate 
But the fear was in my heart 
I realized too late 
The house of spirits call 

For the Eldar 
I'm trapped inside this dream 
Of the Eldar's 
Song of the doom 

High's the fee 
Soon my spirit will return 
Welcome dawn 
Your light will take me home 

I say farewell 

To the Eldar 
I'm trapped inside this dream 
Of the Eldar's 
Song of doom
