"'''Learn now the lore of Living Creatures!'''" is a poem-list spoken by [[Treebeard]] to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]". The list seems to be very ancient, as Treebeard said he had learned it when he was young.

==Poem==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Learn now the lore of Living Creatures!
First name the four, the free peoples:
Eldest of all, the [[Elves|elf-children]];
[[Dwarves|Dwarf]] the delver, dark are his houses;
[[Ents|Ent]] the earthborn, old as mountains;
[[Men|Man]] the mortal, master of horses:

Beaver the builder, buck the leaper,
Bear bee-hunter, boar the fighter;
Hound is hungry, hare is fearful...

Eagle in eyrie, ox in pasture,
Hart horn-crown√©d; hawk is swiftest,
Swan the whitest, serpent coldest...
</poem>


The list is said to be very long, and it is certain that Treebeard skipped many of the verses. Merry and Pippin suggested to him the addition of another line to go along:

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Half-grown [[hobbits]], the hole-dwellers.
</poem>

Treebeard approved of this addition to the list.
