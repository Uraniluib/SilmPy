==Summary==
Tolkien thanked [[wikipedia:John Giffard, 3rd Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]] in advance for whisky that Halsbury sent, and thought back of when Halsbury came to visit, on [[26 July|July 26]]. The fragment ended with a statement about [[Galadriel]]. She was "unstained", not part of the [[Oath of Fëanor|deeds]] of [[Fëanor]]. She longed for dwelling in [[Middle-earth]], and had the misfortune that at her time of departure, [[Manwë]] spoke his [[Doom of Mandos|ban on emigration]].

==Notes==
By stating Galadriel had no part in the crimes of Fëanor, Tolkien contradicted himself; in [[Letter 320]], he said she was a "leader in the rebellion against the [[Valar]]".
