The '''Elven Hymn to [[Varda|Elbereth]]''' is a song which was sung by a [[Wandering Companies|company]] of [[Elves]], led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], as they passed through [[the Shire]] in the late [[Third Age]]. It was overheard by [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. Although the elves would have been singing in [[Sindarin]], of which Frodo knew only a little, he was still able to interpret the meaning of the song. Its content is similar to ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]''. 

==Song==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;"> 
Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!
	O Queen beyond the Western Seas!
O light to us that wander here
	Amid the world of woven trees!

Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
	Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!
Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee
	In a far land beyond the sea.

O Stars that in the Sunless Year
	With shining hand by her were sown,
In windy fields now bright and clear
	We see your silver blossom blown!

O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!
	We still remember, we who dwell
In this far land beneath the trees,
	Thy starlight on the Western Seas.
</poem>
