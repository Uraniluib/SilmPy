'''Ellinikós Sýllogos Philon Tólkin''' (Greek: '''Ελληνικός Σύλλογος Φίλων Τόλκιν''', ''Greek Society of Tolkien Friends''), also known as the '''Greek Tolkien Society''' and '''The Prancing Pony''', is a [[Tolkien Societies|Tolkien Society]] based in Greece. 

It started as a semi-official website intended to promote [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] for the Greek audience by hosting a forum; eventually it evolved into a full-functioning society in [[October]] [[2002]].

The society was unofficially divided into two "smials", one in Athens and one in Thessaloniki (and all northern Greece).

Some of the activities of the GTS have been the issues of the ''[[News from Bree]]'' fanzine, as well as co-operating for the subtitlization of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' in Greek theaters. Also, the Society participates in the [[International Tolkien Fellowship]] and its members are often present in Tolkien events over Europe. 

In October [[2007]], the GTS hosted the first overboard Tolkien gathering on Greek ground on the island of [[Wikipedia:Andros|Andros]] with [[Marcel Bülles]] chairman of the [[German Tolkien Society]] and [[Caspar Reiff]] of ''[[Tolkien Ensemble]]'' as special guests. The happening was conveniently named "Cair Andros".
