{{quote|I had the real blessing of watching Peril to the Shire and I have to say I enjoyed it enormously! I can't believe the passion and devotion to Tolkien that was behind such a great undertaking.|"Patty" at ''theonering.net''}}

{{quote|A well thought out storyline. I do like the what was the rest of the world was doing while the Fellowship was off gallivanting about tales. [...] The talents of your elvish singers and harpist also deserve recognition. Your credits [...] complete with popsicle wrangler [...] were a treat as well.|"Sevilodorf" at ''theonering.net''}}
