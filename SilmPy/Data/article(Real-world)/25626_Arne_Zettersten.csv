In [[1965]], Zettersten presented his doctoral thesis on the [[AB language]], a medieval literary dialect first identified by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. And during the 1960s in [[Oxford]], Zettersten became a friend and colleague of Tolkien, as they both shared an interest in a certain collection of medieval manuscripts (the "[[Katherine Group]]"). Their contact continued throughout the last 13 years of Tolkien's life. Arne Zettersten died 2015, aged 81.
