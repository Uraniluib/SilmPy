'''Wuthering Heights''' is a Danish heavy metal band, with a somewhat eclectic musical style which falls in somewhere between progressive, folk, and power metal. Their lyrics are inspired by the work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

==History==
The group formed in [[1989]] under the name Angelica. They changed their name to "Minas Tirith" for the release of a demo cassette, entitled ''Tales From the Woods'' in late [[1992]]. By the release of their second demo in 1995 the band had again changed their name, to "Vergelmir". They were inactive in the studio for a few more years until, as "Wuthering Heights", they released the album ''Within'' in [[1999]]. They followed this up with ''To Travel For Evermore'' in [[2002]] and ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' in [[2004]], which has received some critical acclaim amid the underground power metal and folk metal communities. In the summer of [[2004]] the band played outside Europe for the first time. The gig took place at the ProgPower festival in Atlanta, GA. The band's fourth release was ''The Shadow Cabinet'' from [[2006]].
