==The poem==
<poem>
''Hop along, my little friends, up the [[Withywindle]]!''
''Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle.''
''Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.''
''When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,''
''Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.''
''Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!''
''Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.''
''Hey now! merry dol! We'll be waiting for you!''
<br>
''Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!''
''Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.''
''Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!''
<br>
''Now let the song begin! Let us sing together''
''Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,''
''Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,''
''Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,''
''Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:''
''Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!''
