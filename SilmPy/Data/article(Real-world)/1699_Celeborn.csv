'''Celeborn''' ([[Sindarin|S]]: "silver-tall", pron. {{IPA|[ˈkeleborn]}}) was a noble [[Elves|Elf]] - a member of the [[Sindar]]<ref name=appb/><ref name=rgeo/> - who wedded  [[Galadriel]] of the [[Noldor]]. After crossing the Blue Mountains at the beginning of the Second Age and living in the realm of [[Eregion]] for a while, he and Galadriel moved to [[Lothlórien]] to become the [[Lord of Lórien|Lord and Lady of Lórien]]. His daughter [[Celebrían]] married [[Elrond]] Half-elven whose daughter [[Arwen]] chose a mortal life to wed [[Aragorn]].

==History==
===Early life===
Celeborn was a [[Sindar|Sindarin]] prince from [[Doriath]],<ref name="Sil-13">{{S|13}}</ref> being the grandson of [[Elmo]] the brother of [[Thingol|Elwe/Thingol]], and thus he was the grand-nephew of the [[King of Doriath]].<ref name="GC"/> 

{{seealso|#Telerin descent}}

[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|left|thumb|Līga Kļaviņa - ''Love at First Sight'']]
In the early [[Years of the Sun]] [[Finrod]] and [[Galadriel]] came to Doriath as guests of Elu Thingol. There Celeborn and Galadriel  met, fell in love and were wedded. Galadriel remained in Doriath with Celeborn after [[Finrod]] went to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]]. <ref name="Sil-13"/>

For the rest of the [[First Age]] Celeborn and Galadriel are not mentioned to have played any significant role in the general course of events of the Age, while their relatives, both Sindarin and Noldorin did. The only thing that can be said for sure, is that the couple survived the [[Wars of Beleriand]], including the [[Second Kinslaying]] by the [[Sons of Feanor]]<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>. They may have escaped to the [[Havens of Sirion|Havens]] or the [[Isle of Balar]].

===Second Age===
After the [[War of wrath|fall of Beleriand]], Celeborn and Galadriel came to [[Lindon]] the coastal region west of the Blue Mountains. Celeborn ruled the fief of [[Harlindon]], which was composed mostly of Sindar, under the [[High King of the Noldor]] [[Gil-galad]].<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref> They eventually came to [[Eregion]] where they dwelt for a time with [[Celebrimbor]] and the jewelsmiths of [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]. After Celebrimbor had largely taken over, they made contact with the  [[Nandor]] of Lindórinand, across the [[Hithaeglir]]. Not long after they went through [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] to live there, becoming great among its people. 

It is said that Celeborn fought in the [[Sack of Eregion]], and he and [[Elrond]] narrowly escaped to a dell, where the latter founded [[Rivendell]].<ref name="GC"/> 

After the Sack of Eregion, Celeborn and Galadriel came to Lindórinand, the land of [[Silvan Elves]] which was ruled by King [[Amdir]]. When Amdir died in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], his son [[Amroth]] succeeded him. 

===Third Age===
In early Third Age Amroth was weary of Middle-earth and wished to sail to the [[Valinor|West]]. He departed to [[Edhellond]] and by the year {{TA|1981}}, King Amroth drowned in the Bay of Belfalas. Celeborn and Galadriel took the title [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim|Lord and Lady]] of Lothlórien, the new name for Lindórinand and together they built [[Caras Galadhon]].

Celeborn and Galadriel had a daughter named [[Celebrían]],<ref group=note>Celebrían's exact date and place of birth are not specified.</ref> who later married [[Elrond]] Half-elven of [[Rivendell]], thus making Celeborn and his wife Galadriel the grandparents of the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] and their younger sister [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]]. 
[[File:Rowena Morrill - The Swan-Boat of Galadriel.jpg|thumb|left|Rowena Morrill - ''The Swan-Boat of Galadriel'']]
In response to the growing threat of [[Dol Guldur]], the [[White Council]] was formed in {{TA|2463}}. Galadriel was on it; it is likely that Celeborn was also a member. 

During the [[War of the Ring]] in {{TA|3019}}, Lórien received the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], composed of various travelers on the [[Quest of the Ring|quest]] to destroy [[the One Ring]]. He offered advice, and boats for the [[Anduin]], speeding them on their way. 

Celeborn's most significant recorded actions came in the same year (in March 3019), when he repulsed three attacks by [[orcs]] of [[Dol Guldur]]. Celeborn then marshalled his forces to cross the Anduin and [[Fall of Dol Guldur|lay siege to Dol Guldur]]. He captured the fortress, and Galadriel threw down its walls and purified it.

===After the War of the Ring===
Celeborn attended the wedding of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and his granddaughter [[Arwen]], and on the journey to return bade a fond farewell to [[Treebeard]] as well.

{{quote|I do not think we shall meet again."<br>"I do not know, Eldest.|[[Treebeard]] and Celeborn, ''[[Many Partings]]''}}.

Celeborn returned to Lothlórien, but the power of [[Nenya]] was broken. It no longer was filled with the light and life it had before. Galadriel shortly after passed West with the other [[Ring-bearers]], and Celeborn, weary, moved to Imladris to live with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], Elrond’s sons. After [[Círdan]]'s departure Celeborn was the last of the [[Wise]] in Middle-earth, they that had seen the struggles of [[Elves|Elvenkind]]. It is not recorded when he sought the [[Grey Havens]] and sailed west, but when he did so he took with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth<sup>[[#References|7]]</sup>.

==Character==
What can be gleaned of his personality is that he was quick-thinking and swift to act, one of the wisest elves of Middle-earth in the Third Age. He was a warrior too, leading his followers into battle against [[Dol Guldur]] and other menaces. 

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Up to the time when ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was published, there had been no mention of Celeborn in the previously written legendarium.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later attempted multiple times to fix upon the story behind such an important elf. He remains a fairly unsubstantial character in the legendarium, for despite his profound effect upon the doings of the Elder Days, there is very little direct information on him as a person.

In his first writings (which make up the bulk of the matter of Celeborn)and the works published during Tolkien's lifetime, the elf-lord is portrayed as a kinsman of Thingol and one of the Sindar,<ref name=appb>{{App|B1}}</ref><ref name=rgeo>{{RGEO|Notes}}</ref> and met Galadriel when she came with the Noldor into exile. In a brief, speculative paper written by Tolkien included in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Celeborn is made Thingol’s grandnephew, by the King’s brother [[Elmo]], who is also linked to Círdan. Elmo appears nowhere else in the legendarium.
===Telerin descent===
According to an alternate history of Celeborn and Galadriel in [[Unfinished Tales]], Celeborn was a [[Teler]] of noble rank in [[Alqualondë]], born '''[[Teleporno]]'''<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 347, 364 (note 46)</ref>, grandson of [[Olwë]], King of the [[Falmari]] (so that he still was a kinsman of the king Thingol back in Beleriand).<ref name="GC">{{UT|6}}</ref>

[[Galadriel|Artanis]], Olwë's granddaughter and a [[Noldor]]in princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet ''[[Alatáriel]]'', meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland".<ref name="Shib">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> Teleporno's name gained an additional [[Quenya]] form, '''[[Telporno]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[telˈporno]}}).

Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|First Kinslaying]]. Nevertheless, Artanis’s heart was fired by the stories of [[Fëanor]] of the open lands across the [[Belegaer|sea]]. She urged Teleporno to take a ship eastward to [[Endor]], and he gave in. In doing so the two fell under the [[Ban of the Valar]].

In Beleriand, Teleporno and Artanis were greeted by [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], High King of the [[Sindar]] and Lord of [[Doriath]]. Teleporno eventually "[[Sindarization|Sindarized]]" his name to Celeborn; Artanis Sindarinized the epithet Celeborn had given her, and Alatáriel became Galadriel.
===Controversy===
Celeborn as a Telerin prince seems a late development. This altered origin was not adopted into the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', primarily because it contradicted published [[canon]], and was not incorporated in Tolkien's drafts of the earlier parts, and therefore would have necessitated a major rewrite by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] to account for a separate departure of Galadriel. 

{{quote|On the other hand, the making of Celeborn into a Telerin Elf of Aman contradicts not only statements in The Silmarillion, but also those cited already from The Road Goes Ever On and Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings”|[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[Unfinished Tales]]}}

It's unknown whether Tolkien would have revised the story or would have felt bound by published writings.

His Telerin ancestry would have made the couple first or second cousin. In the [[Morgoth's Ring]] it is stated that the first cousins might marry, but seldom did so, or desired to do so.<ref>{{MR|Laws}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Celeborn.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Celeborn'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''[[celeb]]'' ("silver") + a derivative of ''[[ornā]]'' ("tall"). ''Teleporno'', his original [[Telerin]] name, has an identical meaning. The name Teleporno was "Sindarized" as ''Celeborn'': [[Telerin]] ''[[telepi|telpe]]'' ("silver") (Quenya ''[[telpe|tyelpe]]'') was transformed to Sindarin ''celeb''.<ref>{{UT|6e}}</ref>

He was given the epithet "the Wise" by Galadriel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
