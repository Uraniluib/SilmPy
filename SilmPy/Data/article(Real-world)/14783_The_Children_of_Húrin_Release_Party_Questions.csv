* What was the most remarkable thing you learned about Tolkien from editing Beowulf and the Critics?
* I have heard that C. S. Lewis critiqued/commented on Tolkien's translation of Beowulf.  What part did Lewis play in his Beowulf translation?

==Mark T. Hooker==
* In your interview with the website Tolkien Library (http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/mark-hooker-interview.htm), in answer to the question "why has Tolkien been so unpopular with the critics?" you said that Tolkien "wrote for an audience of one: himself," while we know that Tolkien shared his work in draft with the members of the Inklings. Could you comment on this seeming incongruity?

* Guess writing these articles is much for you... or so it feels when i read them?
* You plan any new books in the future?
* How you came to choose James Dunning for illustrating the Tolkienian Mathomium?

==Verlyn Flieger==
* How did you first get interested in Tolkien?
* Do you prefer to read the Middle-earth related works?
* Your books tend to begin with motifs central to Tolkien's work such as light, time, and music.  What do you see as the relationship between these motifs and what do they tell us about Tolkien's universe?
* After editing Smith of Wootton Major, how you do you see that work in relation to the legendarium?
* How do you view The Hobbit in relation to The Lord of the Rings and the "Silmarillion" legends?
* There has been much debate between you and Tom Shippey on how to best read and interpret Smith of Wootton Major. In your opinion, how well does SoWM function as an allegory?  
* In a rather obscure quote, which appears in a Tolkien obituary, Robert Murray suggested that after Tolkien handed him a copy of Smith of Wootton Major, Tolkien said, "Here is a little counterblast to [C. S.] Lewis which I've written" (The Tablet 879).  What do you think he meant by this?
* How was it to be working on Smith of Wootton Major? 
* Do you feel that Simth of Wootton Major should get some more attention?
* Will you write any new book on Tolkien?
* Tolkien's story of the children of Hurin is often associated with a story from the Kalevala; do you also think it might be derived partly from the Arthurian story of Balin and Balan, as in f.e. Malory/Tennyson/Swinburne, with the strong but 'unlucky' warrior who is banished from a king for his rough manners and who eventually kills a beloved?
* In the chapter in 'Interrupted music' on Tolkien and the Arthurian mythos, you mention the unfinished poem ´The fall of Arthur,´ which has always intrigued me. Is there anything you can tell about it beyond your comments and the paragraph on it in Humphrey Carpenter´s biography?
* There's an (in)famous essay by Bob Dylan critic Michael Gray, in which he, among other things, compares Dylan's ' Lay down your weary tune' to Tolkien's 'Song of Nimrodel,' stressing how Tolkien's poem perfectly fits the melody of the song. Reason may be that Dylan created the song in the ballad tradition (esp. the British, in this case), a tradition Tolkien was also familiar with, though through other means. How do you think Tolkien regarded this predominantly oral traditon?

==Nils Ivar Agøy==
* Were there any special challenges in translating ''The Children of Húrin'' into Norwegian?
* How do you see ''The Children of Húrin'' affecting public perception of Tolkien's work in Norway?
* You also translated ''The Silmarillion''; are there any large differences in translating the part of Túrin Turambar and now ''The Children of Húrin''?
* Since you have been so closely involved, working with the English text, did you find major changes of style, content, etc with the already published parts?
* Do you now have the feeling the story is indeed 'finished'?
* How long did it take to translate ''The Silmarillion'' and now ''The Children of Húrin''?
* You have translated the Unfinished Tales as well, since most of the new Tolkien book comes from Unfinished Tales you have a good view of the new choice Christopher Tolkien took for the new book. Can you tell us a bit more about this?
* Is the new Tolkien book a big improvement compared to Unfished Tales?

==James Dunning==
* Have both enjoyed your art and your articles, what is your prefered medium?
* We saw your illustrations in ''A Tolkienian Mathomium'' by Mark Hooker, how did you get into contact?
* Do you plan to illustrate more Tolkien related books in the future?
* Will you write more articles on Tolkien as well? (please do so!)
* In addition to Tolkien illustrations what other kinds of art do you create?
* How do you work to illustrate a scene from Tolkien's books?
* Can you tell us a bit about yourself... what do you do for a living?
* In your article "Wizardry, Witchcraft and the Bloodthirsty World of Faerie," in the March 2007 issue of ''Beyond Bree'', you talk about the layers on meaning in the word 'wizard.' In the definitions you cite for 'wizard,' the first one (the one with the positive connotation) contains the words 'wisdom' and 'knowledge,' but the second (the one with the negative connotation) only contains the word 'knowledge.' Do you think that Tolkien was aware of this division?

==John Garth==
* What challenges and other interesting moments did you have researching Tolkien's wartime experiences?
* How long did it take to write Tolkien and the Great War?
* Did you find out more informations since the publication of your book since the publication?
* Have you learned new things about Tolkien during the process of writing the book?
* How come you choise to write about the war... is it one of your fascinations?
* Can you clarify some more about Tolkien and horses. I never heard about Tolkien being any good with horses.
* How did you go about obtaining permission to use and publish some of Tolkien's previously unpublished letters and manuscripts for Tolkien and the Great War?

==Diana Glyer==
* To what extent did Tolkien and Lewis help shape each other's invented universes?
* How long did you work on the Company they Keep?
* How do you compare your book to the Inklings by Carpenter?
* Will you be doing lectures in the future on the Inklings, and if so will you also come to Europe?
* Where started your interest in the Inklings?
* We know you combine family life with work and writing, how can you manage to combine it all?
* Is there any update on the publishing of Tolkien's grammer of the langauge of Taliska said to have been spoken by men of the first age and based on Tolkien's study of Gothic?
* Which member of the Inklings do you think had the most lasting influence or impact on another member?
* Do you think there was tension over the fact that Tolkien was Catholic and Lewis, for the most part, remained devoted to the Church of England?
* Tolkien's relationship with Charles Williams seems a bit odd.  Though he must have known him pretty well, in many of his published letters, he was often critical of him and his work, and sometimes went as far as saying he never really knew him.  Why do you think he had such animosity towards him?
* Of the members of the Inklings, who do you think was closest to Tolkien?
* Why do you think C. Tolkien has contributed so much to his father's work without ever having really attempted to write his own fiction?
* What is your favorite book of one of the minor Inklings?
* Out of all the Inklings, it seems to me that Tolkien was the one who was influenced by the Inklings the least (i.e. Lewis's Bandersnatch quote).  How much did the Inklings ''really'' influence or affect Tolkien's work?  Wouldn't Tolkien have probably written all he had regardless if he had ever been a part of the Inklings or not?

==Turbine==
* What has been harder, pleasing the Tolkien fans or pleasing the gamers?
* Were you a Tolkien fan prior to creating the game?
* What would you say is the most innovative/unique aspect about LotRO?
* What was the most difficult task you faced and overcame?
* At the moment, the game plays only in Eriador - what are the planned expansion dates to further areas? How far will this roll out to?

==Michael Martinez==
* Do you have any plans to write more Tolkien-related essays?
* How did you became to write about Tolkien?

==Marcel Bülles==
*How did you first become interested in Tolkien?
*Have you contacts within the Inklings Gesellschaft? What is the difference between the Inklings Gesellschaft and the DTG?
*Why do think that international relations between Tolkien societies are of paramount importance?
* What do you think of the usefulness of the International Tolkien Fellowship?
*Could you tell us a bit about your dissertation on the US fandom?
*What articles/projects do you have in mind on Tolkien right now?

==John D. Rateliff==
