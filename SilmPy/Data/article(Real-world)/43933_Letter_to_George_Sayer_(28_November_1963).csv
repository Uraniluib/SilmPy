==Excerpt==

"A Catholic could not possibly say anything sincere about Jack's books without giving widespread offence"

"But then Jack [C. S. Lewis] never sent me anything. Not even of Screwtape Letters which he dedicated to me (without permission). I was wryly amused to learn from the Daily Telegraph that 'Lewis was never (sic) himself very fond of this work'. I after/often [this word is especially hard to discern] wondered why the dedication was made. Now I knowâ€”or should."
