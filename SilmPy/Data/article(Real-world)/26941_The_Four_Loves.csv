'''''The Four Loves''''' is a book by [[C.S. Lewis]] which explores the nature of love from a Christian perspective through thought-experiments and examples from literature. In a passage in the chapter on friendship ("Philia - Friendship"), Lewis invokes his friends [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ("Ronald") and [[Charles Williams]] ("Charles") as examples: 

{{quote|In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets. Now that Charles is dead, I shall never again see Ronald's reaction to a specifically Caroline joke. Far from having more of Ronald, having him 'to myself' now that Charles is away, I have less of Ronald. ... We possess each friend not less but more as the number of those with whom we share him increases.|C.S. Lewis}}
