==Excerpts==

Daddy may be interested to hear that I have been elected a
fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (on the strength of
'The Lord of the Rings' I suppose):  a pleasant compliment and
pat of approval, and one which few if any 'philologists' or
language men have received.

The Dutch edition and translation are going well.  I have had to
swot at Dutch;  but it is not a really nice language.  Actually,
I am at present immersed in Hebrew.  If you want a beautiful but
idiotic alphabet, and a language so difficult that it makes Latin
(or even Greek) seem footling but also glimpses into a past that
makes Homer seem recent - that is the stuff!  (I am hoping when
I retire to get included in a new Bible-translation team that is
brewing.  I have passed the test: with a version of the Book of
Jonah.  Not from Hebrew direct!  Incidentally, if you ever look
at the Old Testament, and look at Jonah you'll find that the
"whale" - it's not really said to be a whale, but a big fish - is
quite unimportant.  The real point is that God is much more
merciful than 'prophets', is easily moved by penitence, and won't
be dictated to even by high ecclesiastics whom he has himself
appointed.)  However, there are too many absorbing things in the
world.  One has to choose and stick to a few, with which blessing
and counsel (like preachers) I end - and with my love and good
wishes.   

Grandfather.
