'''The Fellowship''' is a collective of musicologists, world-music artists and early-music performers, led by music director [[Carvin Knowles]]. Their style incorporates elements of world music, chant and music from ancient civilizations. 

The band was formed in 1990 as "The Houndes," featuring Caitlin Elisabeth, Carvin Knowles and Patrick Delaney. In 1998 they changed their name to "The Fellowship" when they began a musicology experiment to discover how the music of  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]’s [[Middle-earth]] may have sounded. Within two years of beginning the recording project, their new direction drew a community of like-minded musicians and guest artists who wanted to participate in their musicological experiment.

'''The Fellowship''' have released one album,  ''[[In Elven Lands]]''.  

They perform on an all-acoustic array of ancient and modern instruments that includes harp, cello, lute, hurdy-gurdy, krumhorn and gong.

The first edition of their album ''[[In Elven Lands]]'' featured vocals by Jon Anderson (lead singer of the progressive rock band "Yes") on four songs. For the digitally remastered Second Edition, Jon Anderson is absent, replaced by South African countertenor Stephen Diaz and New Zealand Maori singer Dennise Pehi.
