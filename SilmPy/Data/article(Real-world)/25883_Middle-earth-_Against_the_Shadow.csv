'''Middle-earth: Against the Shadow''' (MEAS), released in [[1997]], was the first and only expansion to ''[[Middle-earth: The Lidless Eye]]'', the second basic set for [[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game|MECCG]], although it also contained hero cards for use with [[METW]]. 

MEAS mostly balances the game by adding hazards against the ''minion'' player and some support resources for the hero. Notable are the hazard creature versions of the five wizards.

*'''Number of individual cards:''' 170

MEAS was sold in booster packs of 12 cards (36 boosters per display), featuring 2 rares, 4 uncommons and 6 commons per booster pack.
