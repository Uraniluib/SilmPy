==From the back==
In this collection of intimate, candid, and sometimes surprising biographical sketches of the celebreated author and Christian apologist, twenty-four men and women who knew C. S. Lewis – as teacher, colleague, friend – offer their reminiscences and impressions of the complex man behind the critical and academic acclaim.

Through their recollections (specially commissioned for this volume), we see "Jack" Lewis dazzling Oxford as he takes on atheists, materialists, and a host of other challengers. Most poignantly, we see him in everyday settings: striding up and down the platform at a railroad station, presiding over leisurely dinners with students, expounding on the virtues of the pub.

"The net effect of this collection", said the Catholic Review, "is to make us feel that we know Lewis as well [his] friends." And to quote the New Yorker, "The heterogeneity of the contributors assures a variety of Lewises, but certain traits appear in all these accounts: intelligence, imagination, gusto, a sense of fun, and most frequently, magnanimity." Includes a complete bibliography of Lewis.
