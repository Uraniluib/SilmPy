}}'''Saeros''' ([[Years of the Trees]]{{fact}} – {{FA|484}}) was an Elf of the [[Nandor]]<ref name="S-Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref> who lived in [[Doriath]].

==History==
Saeros was a member of the court of King [[Thingol]] after the [[First Battle]]. When [[Túrin]] came to Doriath as a fosterchild five centuries later, Saeros had become a counsellor to the King, and was jealous that such honor should be given to a [[Man]]. 

When Túrin was twenty, Saeros insulted him at a royal dinner, comparing the [[House of Hador|Men of Hithlum]] to animals. In his anger Túrin struck him with a goblet, injuring him. The next day Saeros ambushed Túrin in the woods, but was overcome. Túrin went on to strip him naked and told him to run back to [[Menegroth]] like an animal. While running in terror Saeros fell into a ravine and died. Túrin, fearing King Thingol's wrath, fled Doriath, calling himself ''[[Neithan]]'' ("The Wronged").

== Etymology ==
Saeros' name is difficult to translate, but might mean "Bitter Rain" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[saer]]'' = "bitter" and ''[[ross]]'' = "rain").{{fact}} If "bitter" is the root word of his name, then ''Saeros'' is probably a epithet.{{fact}}

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
Saeros was named '''''Orgof''''' in ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', ''[[The Later Annals of Beleriand]]'' and earlier version of ''The Silmarillion''.<ref name="LR">{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 321</ref><ref name="SM">{{SM|Silmarillion}}, pp. 28 & 58</ref> He never confronted Túrin in the woods, but is killed at the dinner party by the goblet Túrin threw at him.<ref>{{WJ|One}}</ref> 

In an accompanying note to ''The Grey Annals'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote the name '''''Orgol''''' in the margin;<ref name=WJP1/> in the appendix to ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] made the following comment on the issue:

{{blockquote|It seems, incidentally, certain from a closer understanding of the relations of the manuscripts that my father rejected the name ''Saeros'' and replaced it by ''Orgol'', which by 'linguistic accident' coincides with Old English ''orgol'', ''orgel'' 'pride'. But it seems to me too late now to remove ''Saeros''.|{{CH|A2}}, p. 287}}
