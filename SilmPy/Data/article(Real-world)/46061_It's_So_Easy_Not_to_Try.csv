'''It's So Easy Not to Try''' is a song written by [[Maury Laws]] (music) and [[Jules Bass]] (lyric) and performed by [[Glenn Yarbrough]] for the [[1980]] animated movie [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'']]. It has the identical melody of "[[Roads (song)|Roads]]" (of which there is also a reprise in ''The Return of the King'') from [[Rankin/Bass]]' [[1977]] adaptation of [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'']].

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
It's so easy not to try;
Let the world go drifting by.
If you never say hello,
You won't have to say goodbye.

It's so easy not to try;
Never stay around to cry.
Move along when troubles come
Like a mindless butterfly.

For what good is it to love
When the loving always ends?
Travel on the road that strays;
Not the one with hills and bends.

It's so easy not to try;
Let the world go drifting by.
If you never say hello,
You won't have to say goodbye.
</poem>
