==From the Publisher==

{{blockquote|The War of the Ring takes up the story of [[The Lord of the Rings]] with the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and the drowning of [[Isengard]] by the [[Ents]], continues with the journey of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] to the Pass of [[Cirith Ungol]], describes the war in [[Gondor]], and ends with the parley between [[Gandalf]] and the ambassador of the Dark Lord before the [[Black Gate|Black Gate of Mordor]]. Unforeseen developments that would become central to the narrative are seen at the moment of their emergence: the palantíri bursting into fragments on the stairs of Orthanc, its nature as unknown to the author as to those who saw it fall, or the entry of [[Faramir]] into the story.The book is illustrated with plans and drawings of the changing conceptions of [[Orthanc]], [[Dunharrow]], [[Minas Tirith]] and the tunnels of [[Shelob's Lair]].}}
