<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
[[Gondor]]! Gondor, between the Mountains and the [[Belegaer|Sea]]!
West Wind blew there; the light upon the [[White Tree of Gondor|Silver Tree]]
Fell like bright rain in gardens of the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] of old.
O proud walls! White towers! O [[Crown of Gondor|wingéd crown]] and throne of gold!
O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree,
Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?
