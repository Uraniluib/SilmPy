'''Laocoon''' was the name Tolkien gave to one of his favourite trees at the [[Wikipedia:University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden of Oxford]]. Laocoon was a [[Wikipedia:European Black Pine|Black Pine, lat. ''Pinus nigra'']]

On the last known photograph of Tolkien (taken [[9 August]] [[1973]]), he appears standing next to the tree.<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/815-The_Queen_of_Hobbits_For_Sale.php The Queen of Hobbits for sale] at [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/ Tolkienlibrary.com] (accessed 24 June 2011)</ref>

According to Dr Stephen Harris of Oxford Universityâ€™s Department of Plant Sciences: 

{{blockquote|The received wisdom regarding the black pine is that it was planted in 1799 from seed that was collected by the Third Sherardian Professor of Botany, John Sibthorp, in Austria. We know that Sibthorp sent considerable amounts of plant material to Oxford from the eastern Mediterranean in 1786/87 and that he was in Austria in 1785. He was also in regions of Black Pine growth in 1795 but he died in 1796.|<ref>[http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/black-pine The black pine] at [http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/ Botanic Garden Official website]</ref>}}

If the story of the Black Pine is true then it should be at least 215 years old. 

The tree suffered a collapse on the [[26 July]] [[2014]] and is to be cut down due to safety concerns.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ_VlXB6pQ Collapse of the Tolkien tree] at [http://www.youtube.com/ Youtube.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/black-pine The black pine] at [http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/ Botanic Garden Official website]</ref>
