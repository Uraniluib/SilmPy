==From the auction==

{{Quote|In the letter Tolkien apologises 'that [[Farmer Giles of Ham|this]] is only half a book. Even so it cost me great pains.' He goes on to mention his health 'Am going away on Friday next by Doctor's orders to ''me'' not to [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]], though she is pretty groggy. I am now nearly out of juice: mental, or physical.'|Bloomsbury Auctions<ref name=Bloom/>}}
