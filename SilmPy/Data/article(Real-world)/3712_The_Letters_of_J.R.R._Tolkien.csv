'''''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien''''' is a selection of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s letters published in 1981, edited by his son [[Christopher Tolkien]] and the biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]]. For the 1999 edition of the book, an index was created by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]].

==Contents==
The selection contains 354 letters, dating between October [[1914]], when Tolkien was an undergraduate at the [[University of Oxford]], and [[29 August|August 29]], [[1973]], four days before his death.

The letters can be roughly divided in four categories:
#Personal letters to [[Edith Tolkien]], Christopher Tolkien and his other children,
#Letters about Tolkien's career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon
#Letters to his publishers at [[Allen and Unwin]] explaining his failing to meet the deadline and related topics
#Letters about [[Middle-earth]] 

The last category is especially of interest to Tolkien fans, as it provides a lot of information about Middle-earth which cannot be found anywhere in the works published by Tolkien himself.
