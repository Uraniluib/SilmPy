The '''AB language''' refers to a medieval literary dialect first identified by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the article "[[Ancrene Wisse and Hali Mei√∞had]]" (published in [[Essays and Studies (1929)|''Essays and Studies by Members of the English Association'', 14]]).

Tolkien had found that the [[Middle English]] spelling habits of the manuscript ''[[Ancrene Wisse (manuscript)|Ancrene Wisse]]'' (i.e., "A") showed great similarities to the manuscripts of the [[Katherine Group]] (i.e., "B"). This lead Tolkien to propose the existence of a standard literary language (the AB language) in the West Midland area of England in the 13th century. Tolkien's further investigations of the AB language led him to publish his [[Ancrene Wisse (book)|edition of ''Ancrene Wisse'']] in 1962.

According to [[Arne Zettersten]], Tolkien's research on the AB language was perhaps his most important academic contribution, influencing the work of his student and colleague [[Simonne d'Ardenne]] and Zettersten himself, as well as contemporary research on Middle English.<ref>''[[J.R.R.
