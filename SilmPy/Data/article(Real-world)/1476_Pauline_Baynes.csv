'''Pauline Diana Gasch, n√©e Baynes''' ([[9 September|September 9]], [[1922]] - [[2 August|August 2]], [[2008]]) was an English book illustrator, whose work encompasses more than 100 books.  Though her early years were spent in India, where her father was commissioner in Agra, she and her elder sister came to England for their schooling.  Baynes attended the Slade School of Fine Art, but after a year she volunteered to work for the Ministry of Defence, painting camouflage, though she was soon transferred to a map-making department (knowledge of which she later employed to good effect when she drew maps of [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] for [[C.S. Lewis]] and of [[Middle-earth]] for [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]). 

Baynes was [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s chosen illustrator. In 1949, she illustrated ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', followed by cover art for the
1961 Puffin edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and a triptych for the slip-case of the 1964 deluxe edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In 1962, she illustrated ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', and in 1967, ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''. Before Tolkien's death, she also illustrated two posters: "[[A Map of Middle-earth]]" ([[1970]]) and "[[There and Back Again (map)|There and Back Again]]" (based on ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[1971]]). After Tolkien's death, she provided illustrations for the poem ''[[Bilbo's Last Song]]'' (as a poster in [[1974]], as a book in [[1990]]) and the collection ''[[Poems and Stories]]'' ([[1980]]). She also painted the covers for the British [[1973]] one-volume and [[1981]] three-volume paperback editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The final published appearance of Baynes' Tolkien art was the addition of her map of "The Little Kingdom" to the fiftieth anniversary edition of ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' ([[1999]]).<ref>"In Memoriam: Pauline Diana Baynes", in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 6]]'', p.vii</ref>
