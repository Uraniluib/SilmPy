==Early comics/cartoons==
[[File:20 November 1954 Newsweek cartoon.jpg|thumb|Single frame cartoon in ''Newsweek'' from 1954]]
The first known published illustration in the comical vein is a single frame cartoon appearing in the [[29 November]] [[1954]] edition of ''Newsweek'' (which contains a review of the newly published ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''). The cartoon, drawn by "M. Simont" (apparently being [[Wikipedia:Marc Simont|Marc Simont]]), portrays the [[Orcs]] of [[Moria]] as hairy creatures with large heads featuring beaks.<ref group=note>The ''Newsweek'' review article speaks about "the terrible feathered orcs", referring to Simon's cartoon. [[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that this portrayal of orcs might have inspired Zimmerman's script of a proposed film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', of which Tolkien wrote in [[letter 210]]: "Why does Z put beaks and feathers on ''Orcs''!?".</ref> [[Gandalf]] wears a robe adorned with what appears to be magical symbols.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?forum=12&post_id=17065|articlename=Newsweek, 1954 - Fellowship cartoon|dated=|website=Guide|accessed=26 February 2017}}</ref>
