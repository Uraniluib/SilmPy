==Summary==
Tolkien reported to his son that the poplars were then leafless (except for one top spray), yet it was still a green and leafy late October.  This time was when [[birches]] look most beautiful, with snow-white skin and remaining leaves shining fallow-gold.  He had to sleep at the Area H.Q.<ref group="notes">An Air Raid Wardens office in the North Oxford area.</ref> that Friday, but was looking forward to visiting [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[wikipedia:C. E. M. Joad|C.E.M. Joad]] the next night.
