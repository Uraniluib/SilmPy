[[File:Alan Lee - Wootton Major.jpg|thumb|right|Wootton Major by [[Alan Lee]]]]'''Wootton Major''' was a town found in ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'', the primary location in the story.  It was named such because it was "larger than [[Wootton Minor]]".  It was well known in the country around it, because of the skill of its craftsmen.  Especially the [[Master Cook]], who was held in high esteem, and every twenty-four years baked a magnificent cake for the [[Feast of Good Children]].  The village held meetings and debates in the old [[Great Hall of Wootton Major|Great Hall]].  From this village came [[Smith Smithson|Smith]], the hero of the short tale, and his ancestors.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
