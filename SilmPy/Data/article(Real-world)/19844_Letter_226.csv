==Summary==
Tolkien told L.W. Forster of his influences. Since the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had already reached [[Bree]] in [[1937]], the Second World War and the [[Letter 102|atomic bomb]] had no influence on the writing. Neither did [[World War I]], though the [[Dead Marshes]] owed something to Northern France after the [[Battle of the Somme]]. However, it owed more to [[William Morris]]' ''[[wikipedia:The House of the Wolfings|The House of the Wolfings]]'' and ''[[The Roots of the Mountains]]''.

==Notes==
* Though not identified, professor Forster was likely L.W. Forster, Schr√∂der professor in German at [[Cambridge|Cambridge University]].
