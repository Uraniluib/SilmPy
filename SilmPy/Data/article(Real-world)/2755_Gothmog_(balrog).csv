'''Gothmog''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈɡoθmoɡ]}}) was the Lord of [[Balrogs]] and the [[High-captain of Angband]], one of the chief servants of the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]] with a rank equal to that of [[Sauron]].

==History==
Gothmog was apparently one of the [[Maiar]] that followed [[Morgoth|Melkor]] to exile, and because of either his brilliant mind or because of his ability to assume an immensely powerful physical form, he was made the Lord of Balrogs.

At the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] he mortally wounded [[Fëanor]], but called a retreat upon the approach of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] with a sizable force.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>  He next appeared at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where he was also named high-captain of [[Angband]], again inferring his power and status as essentially Morgoth's right-hand Balrog ([[Sauron]], another spirit, played a more domestic than front-line role for his master).  There at the Nirnaeth he slew [[Fingon]], thus allowing him to boast of having slain two of the five [[High Kings of the Noldor]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>  He also captured [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] alive in this battle on Morgoth's command, despite this order allowing Húrin to slaughter of many of Gothmog's troll-guard.<ref>{{CH|2}}</ref>{{rp|59}}

He was again deployed as Morgoth's front-line commander in the [[Fall of Gondolin]], where he was slain by [[Ecthelion of the Fountain|Ecthelion]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>  According to the (albeit non-canonical) text, Gothmog piled his iron siege equipment against the [[North Gate of Gondolin]] until it broke from sheer pressure.<ref name="III">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|176}}  The same text states that he also took a front-line position against [[Rog]], turning the tide in that part of the battle.<ref name="III"/>{{rp|179}}  More confirmed canonically, he beat down [[Tuor]] in single combat, but the elf-lord [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]], who was badly wounded, rose and stood over him.  Ecthelion stood no chance against the Lord of Balrogs, and lost his sword in the brief struggle.  But then Ecthelion leaped forward, and stabbed Gothmog in the breast with the spike atop his helm.  They both fell into the [[Fountain of the King]], where Gothmog, if not already killed by the spike, drowned with his opponent.<ref name="III"/>{{rp|183-4}}

{{Pronounce|Gothmog.mp3|Ardamir}}

==Etymology==

The name ''Gothmog'' is derived from the roots GOS-/GOTH- "dread", and MBAW- "compel, force, subject, oppress" (found also in the title for Morgoth "Bauglir": the tyrant or oppressor).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>{{rp|359, 372}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Gothmog's original name was Kalimbo.

'''Kalimbo''' (also called '''Kosomot'''<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 93</ref> or '''Kosmoko'''<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 216</ref>) was the son of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and the [[Ogres|ogress]] [[Fluithuin|Ulbandi]], as conceived in the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]]. Kalimbo is described as a "savage, uncivilized man, barbarian; [[Giants|giant]], monster, [[Trolls|troll]]".<ref>{{PE|14}}</ref>{{rp|12}}<ref>{{PE|12}}, entry for Kalimbo</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his name to '''Gothmog'''. 

In the character list appended to ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' Gothmog was described as "a son of Morgoth and the ogress [[Fluithuin]],"<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>{{rp|216}} but eventually, the idea that the Valar had [[Valarindi|children]] was discarded altogether.

In one of Tolkien's early Middle-earth writings, ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', "Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs" is mentioned.<ref>{{LB|1e}}</ref> It is not, however, certain if it was another name for Gothmog, or it simply meant "a Balrog lord". According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the latter is more probable, as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.<ref>{{LB|1e}}, Commentary on Part I of the second version</ref>
