==Summary==
[[Image:Patrick Browne 23 May 1972.jpg|thumb|left]]
Tolkien tells Sir Patrick Browne of the price of fame, and his views of being a cult figure: it is not at all pleasant. It makes him feel small and inadequate, though he feels flattered. 

==Notes==
* The fragment chosen was the second part of the actual letter. The [[Pieter Collier|Tolkien Library]] has a picture of the full letter, and [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s correspondence, [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/sdebelder/images/LotrLetter12.jpg online].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/sdebelder/SDB002.htm|articlename=#SDB002 -First Edition set (4/1/2) with published Tolkien letter|dated=|website=TL|accessed=21 May 2012}}</ref>
* Though the "Sir Patrick Browne" is not identified in ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', it is quite probably [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-patrick-browne-1360765.html Patrick Browne], a judge, since Tolkien addresses him as such ("Dear judge") in the full copy.
