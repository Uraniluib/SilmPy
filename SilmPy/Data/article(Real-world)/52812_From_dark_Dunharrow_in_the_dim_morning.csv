==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
From dark [[Dunharrow]] in the dim of morning
with thane and captain rode [[Thengel]]'s son:
to [[Edoras]] he came, the ancient halls
of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded;
golden timbers were in gloom mantled.
Farewell he bade to his free people,
hearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places,
where long he had feasted ere the light faded.
Forth rode the king, fear behind him,
fate before him. Fealty kept he;
oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them.
Forth rode Théoden. Five nights and days
east and onward rode the Eorlingas
through [[Folde]] and [[Fenmarch]] and [[Firienholt|Firienwood]],
six thousand spears to [[Anórien|Sunlending]],
[[Minas Tirith|Mundberg]] the mighty under [[Mindolluin]],
[[Kings of Gondor|Sea-kings]]' city in the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]]
foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled.
Doom drove them on. Darkness took them,
horse and horseman; hoofbeats afar
sank into silence: so the songs tell us.
