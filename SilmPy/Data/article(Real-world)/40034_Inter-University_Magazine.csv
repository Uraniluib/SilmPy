The '''''Inter-University Magazine''''' was a Catholic journal, associated with the Jesuit college of the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=IUM>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]|articleurl=http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/inter-university-magazine/|articlename=Inter-University Magazine|dated=2 March 2012|website=HS|accessed=21 June 2012}}</ref>

Among [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s manuscripts is found a note about publishing his poem "[[Tinfang Warble]]" in the "I.U.M[agazine]".<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|IVn}}, p. 108</ref> Another poem published by Tolkien in this magazine was "[[The Grey Bridge of Tavrobel]]" (in the same or in another issue).<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 353</ref><ref name=IUM/>

[[John Garth]] identified the acronym as likely referring to the ''Inter-University Magazine''.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', p. 327</ref> According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the publication of the former poem took place in [[1927]].<ref name=LT1/> However, he has not been able to retrace how this year was established, and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have therefore suggested "a less absolute publication date" for both poems, to sometime between ?[[1925]] and ?[[1927]].<ref name=IUM/><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.
