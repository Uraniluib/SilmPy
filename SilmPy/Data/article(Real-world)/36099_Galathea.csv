Poor '''Galathea''' was [[Farmer Giles]]' favorite cow who was squashed flat when the [[The Giant|giant]] stepped on her as he came blundering across the farmer's lands one fine summer's night.  Her demise prompted [[Garm]] the dog to awaken Giles to tell him of the giant's arrival, claiming that Galathea was as flat as a doormat.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>

The mythological name ''Galathea'' "milk-white" (fem.)<ref>[[wikipedia:Galathea_%28mythology%29|Galathea (mythology)]] (Wikipedia).</ref> is probably chosen because milk refers to cows in general &ndash; or it refers to the actual colour of the cow (which is not mentioned in the story).
