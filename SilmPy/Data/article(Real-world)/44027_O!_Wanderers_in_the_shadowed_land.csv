__NOTOC__
'''O! Wanderers in the shadowed land''' is a song sung by [[Frodo Baggins]] when walking through the [[Old Forest]]. Its purpose was to encourage the other hobbits to continue on. The trees of the Old Forest did not seem to like the song.<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>

==The poem==
<poem>
''O! Wanderers in the shadowed land ''
''despair not! For though dark they stand, ''
''all woods there be must end at last, ''
''and see the open sun go past: ''
''the setting sun, the rising sun,''
''the day's end, or the day begun. ''
''For east or west all woods must fail... ''
</poem>
(Frodo's voice faded there leaving the song incomplete)
