'''Narn i Hîn Húrin''' ([[Sindarin]] for "'''Tale of the Children of Húrin'''"), also called "'''The Narn'''", is a chapter in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', a posthumously published work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] edited and published by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. It is a long story of all that happened to [[Húrin]] and his children [[Túrin]] and [[Nienor]], after Húrin was cursed by [[Morgoth]]. In 2007, Christopher Tolkien published ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', wherein Tolkien completed the story and completed a single narrative of this tale with minimal editorial presence.

==Story==
The story elaborates on what is told of these characters in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', starting with the childhood of Túrin, continuing through the captivity of his father in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Túrin's exile in [[Doriath]], to Túrin's time in [[Nargothrond]] and ending with his suicide after having slain [[Glaurung]].

The story has some inconsistencies when compared with ''The Silmarillion'', and at points there are gaps and multiple versions. This is because [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never finished the story during his lifetime, and his son [[Christopher Tolkien]] had to choose from all the work to create a consistent narrative for ''The Silmarillion''.

The story of the ''Narn'' continues in the ''Later Narn'', which is published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and in the "Wanderings of Húrin", a text which was found to be too different in style from the rest of ''The Silmarillion'', but which continues the ''Narn'' after Túrin's death. It ends with Húrin's eventual release and the bad deeds which follow him. This story was finally published in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]''.

==Publishing notes==
Note that the title of the ''Narn'' is wrongly given as '''Narn i Hîn Húrin''' in the published ''Silmarillion'' and ''Unfinished Tales''. This was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] which he later regretted, done only to prevent people from pronouncing ''[[Hîn|Chîn]]'' like the English "chin".<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 322</ref>
