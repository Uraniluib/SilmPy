==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|This collection of articles is a Festschrift for Leena Kahlas-Tarkka. In her long career Leena Kahlas-Tarkka has inspired and encouraged countless students with her teaching and the example she has set as a scholar. Her research merits include studies of the early development of English pronouns and verbs, the languages of the Salem witchcraft trials, and individual Early Modern thinkers and translators. The twenty-four articles in this volume cover four different areas of English studies: medieval scholarship, corpus studies, books and genres, and literary perspectives. Together they represent a modern take on philology at work, combining new methods and approaches with a traditional sensibility for the social, cultural and biographical issues that inform the linguist and literary scholar of today.}}
