'''Brian Donald Hewens Miller''' ([[14 October]] [[1924]] - [[26 February]] [[2001]]) was an English scholar and philologist. 

Miller was a Lecturer in English Philology at Oriel College and Brasenose College in Oxford in [[1953]]-[[1957|57]].<ref>''[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/brian-miller-728943.html Brian Miller Obituary]'' at Independent.co.uk, as of July 7, 2010.</ref> During his time in Oxford, Miller also became one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s B.Litt. (''Bachelor of Literature'' or ''Bachelor of Letters'') students (starting on [[20 January|January 20]], [[1952]]). During four years he worked on his thesis on the [[Middle English]] fabliau (comic bourgeois tale) ''Dame Sirith'', examined by Tolkien and [[G.V Smithers]] on [[2 March|March 2]], [[1956]].<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull, Christina]], ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Chronology'', first reference p. 382, last p. 486.</ref>

Miller and Tolkien seem to have continued staying in touch. In [[1971]], he sent Tolkien a copy of C.T. Onions' ''Modern English Syntax'' (the revised edition by Miller, published in the same year). Tolkien replied to Miller on [[21 June|June 21]], thanking for the gift (see letter ''[[Letter to Brian Miller]]'').
