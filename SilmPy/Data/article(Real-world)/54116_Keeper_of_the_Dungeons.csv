The '''Keeper of the Dungeons'''<ref group="note">Despite appearing in the ending credits of ''The Battle of the Five Armies'', he was never given an actual name by the film makers, making him and Azog's underling the only orcs with speaking roles without a name</ref> is a Gundabad orc played by [[Conan Stevens]] in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. Originally intended to be an early design of [[Azog]], his design was later reused for [[Bolg]], and appeared as such in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'',<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/azog-bolg-and-yazneg-the-trios-tangled-design-history/|articlename=Azog, Bolg … and Yazneg: The trio’s tangled design history|dated=16 December 2013|accessed=17 June 2017|website=[http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com A Tolkienist Perspective]}}</ref> and was then scrapped and re-used for this Orc.

==History==
The Keeper of the Dungeons first spots Gandalf hanging in a cage in [[Dol Guldur]]. He removes the cage, and then opens it to remove Gandalf. He then starts interrogating Gandalf about the [[Three Rings|Elven rings]], when suddenly, he spots [[Narya]] on the [[Wizards|Wizard]]'s hand. He attempts to chop it off, but is interrupted by [[Galadriel]], who blasts the orc in pieces, killing him.<ref group="note">This all happens in the extended edition. In the theatrical version, he still attempts to kill Gandalf, but this time for intruding into Dol Guldur.</ref>
