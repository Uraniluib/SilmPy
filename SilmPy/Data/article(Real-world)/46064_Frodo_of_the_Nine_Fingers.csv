Frodo of the Nine Fingers
And the ring of doom...</poem>

'''SPOKEN (MINSTREL OF GONDOR)''': "It has its beginnings two Ages past,
When [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] set forth to reclaim the [[Dwarves]]' [[gold]]
from the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]...
And while on his quest Bilbo stumbled into a deep dank cave."

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">When Bilbo found that shiny ring
In [[Gollum]]'s cave of gloom,
He never thought that it would turn
Into a ring of doom.

The Dragon Smaug, the [[Spiders]], too,
The [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]], the [[Thranduil|Elven-king]],
They came to know the power of
The Hobbit and his ring.

Frodo of the Nine Fingers
And the ring of doom.
It started with a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] in
Gollum's cave of gloom.

The power of the ring, it grew,
And [[Gandalf]] sat in thought.
He knew that it must be destroyed
In fires where it was wrought.

For if in evil hands it fell,
The earth would know its end.
No force of arms would win the day,
No army could contend.</poem>

'''SPOKEN (GANDALF)''': "For evil flourished everywhere and lay on the land like a festering malignancy. There was one hope though, in a distant land, the noble [[Aragorn]], heir to empty throne on [[Gondor]] awaited the small band to return and become king. But he could not triumph until the ring was destroyed, so went the prophecy."

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">Frodo of the Nine Fingers
And the ring of doom
Accepted a heavy burden
For the fires to consume.</poem>

'''SPOKEN (GANDALF)''': "Frodo and his gallant companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] had many brave adventures, until finally they reached the rocky border of [[Mordor]], domained the black lord [[Sauron]]. There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. Samwise vowed to enter the Orc-infested tower alone to save him, and the ring of doom was missing around Frodo's neck."

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">Frodo of the Nine Fingers
And the ring of doom.
Why does he have nine fingers?
Where is the ring of doom?
</poem>
