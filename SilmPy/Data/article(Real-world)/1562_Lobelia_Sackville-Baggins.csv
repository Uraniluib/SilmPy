'''Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, n√©e [[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]''' ({{TA|2918}} - {{TA|3020|n}}, died aged 102) was the second child, and only daughter, of [[Primrose Bracegirdle|Primrose Boffin]] and [[Blanco Bracegirdle]]. 

==History==
Lobelia was born in [[Hardbottle]] and was renowned in the [[The Shire]] for her temper and greed. She married [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s cousin [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], and they had one child together, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]], who was born in {{SR|1364}}.<ref name="Bag">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

Her envy of [[Bag End]] was well-known; <ref name="Return">{{H|Return}}</ref> she could not wait to inherit it, and was furious when [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] made [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] his heir. However, when Frodo left for [[Crickhollow]] he sold Bag End to Lobelia, but unfortunately Otho had died by then.<ref name="Party">{{FR|Part}}</ref> 

During the [[War of the Ring]], Lobelia was imprisoned in [[Lockholes]] for arguing with the [[Chief Shirriff|Chief]]'s Men, and attacking one of them with an umbrella. When she came out, Lobelia was popular for the first time for bravely standing up to the [[Saruman]]'s [[Ruffians|Men]]. However, she was crushed to find out her son had been murdered whilst she was in prison.

After the War of the Ring, Lobelia returned to her home village to live with the other [[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]s, giving Bag End to Frodo. When she died, she gave her money to Frodo to be used to help [[hobbits]] left homeless by Saruman and her son.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>
