==Summary==
This fragment of a letter (just two sentences), dated 23 October 1937, was sent to [[Stanley Unwin]]. Unwin had called him a genius, and added that he doesn't say that to everybody &ndash; in fact, it was the first time in thirty years. Tolkien thanks him, and tells him that he would start writing on something soon.
==Notes==
* Tolkien was working on several writings at this time, the most prominent of them being ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''.
