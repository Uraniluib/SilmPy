The '''Birmingham Oratory''' is a Roman Catholic church in [[Birmingham]], England. It is used primarily by the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, a congregation of priests and lay-brothers. Because of its baroque design, it is often called the "Little Rome in Birmingham". 

The church was constructed between 1907 and 1910 as a memorial to the Blessed John Henry Newman, a prominent English cardinal who converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. 

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], a devout Catholic, worshipped here for about seven years. [[Francis Xavier Morgan]], Ronald and [[Hilary Tolkien]]'s guardian, was a priest of the oratory.
