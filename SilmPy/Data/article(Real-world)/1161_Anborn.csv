}}'''Anborn''' was a [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger of Ithilien]]. 

==History==
He was one of the Rangers in the company under [[Faramir]] who were on a mission to ambush the [[Men of Harad]] in [[Ithilien]]. He had been left behind as a scout near the [[Harad Road|road]]. Just before he returned to [[Henneth Annûn]] he saw [[Gollum]] lurking among the trees, yet he mistook him for a wild beast. He did not shoot him because Faramir had commanded his men not to slay wild beasts for no purpose.<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

Later, Anborn answered Faramir's question as to what was in the forbidden pool below [[Henneth Annûn]], saying that the creature was not a bird since it had four limbs and dove manwise.  He offered to shoot it with his bow, at Faramir's command.  Faramir stayed his hand and when [[Gollum]] was captured had Anborn guard the creature.<ref name="pool"/>
