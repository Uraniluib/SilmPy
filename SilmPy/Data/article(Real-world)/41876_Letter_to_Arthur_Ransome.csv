On [[15 December]] [[1937]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to [[Wikipedia:Arthur Ransome|Arthur Ransome]]'''.<ref name=CG>{{CG|C}}, pp. 207-8</ref>

*'''Subject:''' A reply to Ransome's letter of [[13 December]]. Tolkien acknowledges Ransome's suggestion about changing some words in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Ransome had suggested that it might be inappropriate to use the word ''men'' when referring to [[Hobbits]] and [[Dwarves]]: Tolkien justifies the character [[Thorin]]'s use of ''man'' by claiming it was "''the language in those days''". Tolkien promises to send him a revised copy of the book "''if there is a reprint''", adding that "''sales are not very great''". He also writes: "''To be fancied by you, that is more than any hobbit could have expected''", and that his children have kept Ransome's books from when they were young.<ref name=CG/><ref name=Leeds>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3305/tolkien_sales_are_not_very_great|articlename=Tolkien: "Sales are not very great"|dated=16 October 2012|website=[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ University of Leeds]|accessed=21 October 2012}}</ref>
