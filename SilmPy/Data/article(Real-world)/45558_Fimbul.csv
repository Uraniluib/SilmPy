'''Fimbul''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] who was part of [[Azog]]'s pack that was pursuing [[Thorin and Company]] in the [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' film series]]. He was played by [[Stephen Ure]].

==History==
When Azog had [[Yazneg]] killed for his failure to catch the company of [[Dwarves]] as they headed toward [[Rivendell]], Fimbul became Azog's new lieutenant.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''</ref> Once [[Bolg]] took over leadership of the pack when Azog was summoned back to [[Dol Guldur]] by the [[Sauron|Necromancer]], he continued to serve as lieutenant. When the pack finally caught up to the Company again in [[Lake-town]], Fimbul was the one who notified Bolg that [[Thorin]] and most of the Company had already gone. Almost immediately after that, a slain Orc fell into the boat Fimbul was sitting in at that moment, launching him into the air, only to be decapitated by [[Legolas]] (who happened to be on the balcony of [[Bard]]'s house at that moment).<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''</ref>
==Etymology==
Fimbul has no in-universe meaning: his name is old norse for "great" or "mighty"<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fimbul-</ref>
