'''Livia Rusz''' (also, Livia Rusz) is a Romanian and Hungarian graphic artist, best known for her work in illustration, comic strip and comic book genres. 

Livia Rusz became the first Romanian illustrator of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s work, when she contributed drawings for the first Romanian-language edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ([[O poveste cu un hobbit (1975)|''O poveste cu un hobbit'']], 1975). While working on this project, she was reportedly unable to compare her renditions of [[Hobbits]], [[Elves]] or [[Orcs]] with any previous portrayals by other artists, owing to the scarcity of foreign literature sources in Romania — her work therefore owed much to imagination<ref>(Romanian) György Györfi-Deák, "Cu ochii copiilor, pentru bucuria lor", in ''Caiete Silvane'', June 2009 [cited on Wikipedia], as of June 5, 2010.</ref>.
