==Summary==
Tolkien had read his second chapter, [[The Passage of the Marshes|Passage of the Dead Marshes]], to [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams|Williams]] and reported that they approved of it.  He was nearly done with a third chapter: [[The Black Gate is Closed|Gates of the Land of Shadow]].  He had written three chapters when he only meant to write one.  Soon however he would have to wrench away to tackle exam-papers and lectures.
