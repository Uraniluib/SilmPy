The '''Lament for Boromir''' was a song sung by [[Aragorn]] and [[Legolas]] as the funeral-boat of [[Boromir]] drifted away:

<blockquote>
Aragorn sang: <br>
''Through [[Rohan]] over fen and field where the long grass grows<br>
''The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. <br>
''‘What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight? <br>
''Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight? <br>
''‘I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey, <br>
''I saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away <br>
''Into the shadows of the North, I saw him then no more. <br>
''The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of [[Denethor]], <br>
''‘O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar, <br>
''But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.’ <br>
<br>
Then Legolas sang: <br>
''From the mouths of the [[Bay of Belfalas|Sea]] the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones, <br>
''The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans. <br>
''‘What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve? <br>
''Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve. <br>
''‘Ask not of me where he doth dwell – so many bones there lie, <br>
''On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky, <br>
''So many have passed down [[Anduin]] to find the flowing Sea. <br>
''Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’ <br>
''‘O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward roads runs south, <br>
''But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea’s mouth’. <br>
<br>
Then Aragorn sang again: <br>
''From the Gate of the Kings the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls, <br>
''And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. <br>
''‘What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today? <br>
''What news of Boromir the bold? For he is long away.’ <br>
''‘Beneath [[Amon Hen]] I heard his cry. There many foes he fought, <br>
''His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought. <br>
''His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest, <br>
''And [[Rauros]], golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast. <br>
''‘O Boromir! The [[Tower of Guard]] shall ever northward gaze, <br>
''To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days. <br>
</blockquote>

[[Gimli]] then comments that they left the east wind to him, but he would not sing it.  Aragorn responds that the people of Gondor endure the east wind but do not ask it for tidings, because in that direction lies [[Mordor]] and the Evil in the East.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>
