The '''British Broadcasting Corporation''', or '''BBC''', is the world's largest broadcasting corporation. As such, the company, and especially BBC Radio, have had a major influence on the adaptation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works. 

==BBC Radio Drama==
The ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/soundstart/rdc.shtml BBC Repertory Company]'', was founded in 1940. Early stars included [[Norman Shelley]] and Carleton Hobbs, who have played [[wikipedia:John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Watson]] and [[Wikipedia:Sherlock Holmes|Holmes]] in over nintey radio dramas. 

The "''Rep''" kept an ensemble cast of 30 to 35 actors, up until the mid-1980's. This cast included young theatre talent, such as [[Anthony Daniels]] and [[Bill Nighy|William Nighy]], and was sometimes expanded with popular names. 

This section of the BBC is now called the ''National Radio Company'' or ''NRC'', and has been awarded many times.
