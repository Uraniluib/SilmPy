==Editorial Reviews==

"Because of the combination of information, understanding and insight on which it is founded, The Magical World of the [[Inklings]] is more than outstanding. It is not in the same league with anything else I have come across." - [[Owen Barfield]].


"It is only recently that the full play of Lewis's neo-Platonism is reaching a wider public. Nobody has more revealingly shown the occultic and mythical character of this world-view, and its influence on Lewis's fiction, than did Gareth Knight in his superb book The Magical World of the Inklings." - Dr Andrew Walker, Director of the Centre for Theology and Culture, King's College London.
