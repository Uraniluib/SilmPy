'''Golfimbul''' was a king of the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] of [[Mount Gram]].<ref name="HParty">{{H|Party}}</ref>

==History==
Golfimbul led a band of [[Orcs|goblins]] in an invasion of [[the Shire]] in {{TA|2747}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>. [[Bandobras Took]] met Golfimbul in the [[Northfarthing]] of [[the Shire]] and defeated him in the [[Battle of Greenfields]]. During the battle Bandobras, who was large enough to ride a horse, charged at Golfimbul and knocked off his head with a club. According to a legend, Golfimbul's head flew through the air for 100 yards and went down a rabbit hole. It is said that this is how the game of [[golf]] was invented.<ref name="HParty"/>

==Etymology==
"Fimbul" is Old Norse for "great".<ref>[[Wikipedia:Fimbulwinter#Etymology]]</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] notes that the connection with the English word "golf" suggests that the name is either fictitious or translated [[Westron]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 167</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
At an early stage in writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used the name "[[Fingolfin]]" for the Goblin-leader, which also contained the word "golf" for the joke about the origin of the game (although not as prominently as in "Golfimbul").<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 39</ref>  Many years later, in the never-finished 1960 rewrite of the story, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] intended to change the name to "Gulfimbul".<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, p. 776</ref>  [[John D. Rateliff]] speculated that this was either a further evolution of Tolkien's languages or because he was dropping the golf-joke reference<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, note 24, p. 785</ref> (the 1960 revision was an effort to "upgrade" ''The Hobbit'' to the same epic level as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'').
