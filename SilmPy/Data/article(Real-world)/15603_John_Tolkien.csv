'''John Francis Reuel Tolkien'''  ([[16 November|November 16]], [[1917]] - [[22 January|January 22]], [[2003]]) was [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R.]] and [[Edith Tolkien]]'s first son. He took his second name after his father's guardian, Father [[Francis Xavier Morgan]].<ref>{{HM|Bio}}</ref>

John often had difficulty falling asleep and his father would come on his bed and tell tales. These stories included the tale of [[Carrots]], a boy with red hair who climbed into a cuckoo clock and went off on a series of strange adventures (this was the premise for the character of [[Tom Bombadil]]{{fact}}), and also a tale called "[[The Orgog]]".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 125</ref>

In 13 February [[1944]]  John Tolkien was made Exorcist and Acolyte (the two highest of the Minor Orders of the Roman Catholic Church) in a ceremony at Stonyhurst. He was given his Orders as a priest on [[10 February]] [[1946]].

Father John Tolkien wrote the script of a film about the Cardinal Newman's life, that was shown in June 1957 at the Oratory of Birmingham.<ref> [http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/22nd-june-1957/19/a-film-on-newman A film on newman]</ref>

Between 1957 to 1987 Father John Tolkien lived in Stoke-on-Trent.

In September 1973, Father John Tolkien celebrated a Requiem Mass for his father at the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, in Oxford.

Father John Tolkien's grave is also in the same cemetery, not far from that of his parents.
