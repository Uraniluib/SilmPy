This action packed game simulates the epic struggle from the final chapters of THE HOBBIT. Elves, Men, Dwarves and Great Eagles do battle with Orcs, Wolves and Wargs for control of Lonely Mountain and the vast treasure. As the Free Peoples player you control the hastily allied armies defending the mountain spurs and the Front Gate, entrance to the ancient Dwarven Kingdom. Your numbers are few but among them are some of the best warriors known to Middle-earth. As the Dark Player you command Bolg of the North and his vast host. The weight of numbers is with you as is the element of surprise. The second wave of goblins comes scrambling over Mount Erebor itself. Who will win dominion over the mountain in THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES?
