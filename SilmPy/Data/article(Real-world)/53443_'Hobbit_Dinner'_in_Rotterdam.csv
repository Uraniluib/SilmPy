==Tolkien's speech==

Tolkien delivered his speech in English, Dutch and Elvish. He included the finishing statement: “[...] ''that it is now exactly twenty years since I began in earnest to complete the history of our renowned hobbit-ancestors of the Third Age. I look East, West, North, South, and I do not see Sauron; but I see that Saruman has many descendants. We Hobbits have against them no magic weapons. Yet, my gentlehobbits, I give you this toast: To the Hobbits. May they outlast the Sarumans and see spring again in the trees.''”<ref name=Bio>{{HM|Bio}}</ref>

In [[1993]], an audio recording of the speech was discovered by [[René van Rossenberg]]. An excerpt of the recording was released in [[2014]].<ref name=Huff/>
