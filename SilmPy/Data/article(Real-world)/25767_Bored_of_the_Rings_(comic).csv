Following the release of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], ''[[wikipedia:Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' published spoofs of them under the title '''''Bored of the Rings'''''.

'''The Feeble Shtick of Ka-Ching!''' was published in #416 (cover date April 2002), '''The Two+ Hours''' in #428 (cover date April 2003) and '''Rehash of the Thing''' in #440 (cover date April 2004). The stories were translated for ''Mad Special'' the German version of the magazine.

==Synopsis==
The comic satirizes the ''The Lord of the Rings'' film drawing in seven pages of cartoons. The story is contained in a series of standalone drawings, each spoofing a major scene in the movies, or referencing a then-current event in American media. 

Though it shares a name with the famous [[Harvard Lampoon]] [[Bored of the Rings (book)|book of the same name]], it takes only some names, like Legolamb and Spam Gangrene, and shares no plot elements.
