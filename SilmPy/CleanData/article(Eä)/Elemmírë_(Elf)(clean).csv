 
Elemmírë (Quenya, pron. ) was a Vanyar Elf, famed for the creation of a lament for the Darkening of Valinor, the Aldudénië. When Morgoth assaulted  the Two Trees of Valinor, the Vanyar and other Elves of Valinor were celebrating a festival on Taniquetil, and so Elemmírë most likely personally witnessed the destruction of the Trees. The song the elf made to lament the death of the Two Trees was said to be known by all of the Eldar.
==Etymology==
Elemmírë is obviously named after the star Elemmírë.
Note that the form of the word does not allow us to know whether Elemmírë was a male or a female Elf.
