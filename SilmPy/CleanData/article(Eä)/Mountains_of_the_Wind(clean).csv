The Mountains of the Wind was, according to the Ambarkanta, a range of mountains in the middle of the Middle-earth to the west of Hildórien. It was thus named because of the strong winds "coming from the East before the Sun". The Mountains of the Wind are no more mentioned in the later versions of the legendarium.
In the Ambarkanta maps, the Mountains of the Wind are not shown on Map V, labelled "After the War for the Sake of the Elves"., p. 239, 248 (map), 257.
