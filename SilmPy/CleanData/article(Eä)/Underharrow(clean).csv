Underharrow was a small hamlet on the banks of the Snowbourn river in the valley of Harrowdale in Rohan.  Located just south of Edoras, it was very close to the town of Upbourn.  As the great host of the Rohirrim passed through the town during the War of the Ring, many women were standing sadly outside their homes.  They knew that many of their husbands, fathers, and sons would never return from the battle that was soon at hand.
