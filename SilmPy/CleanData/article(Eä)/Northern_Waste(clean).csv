The Northern Waste was a vast cold region of mostly ice and snow, in the far north end of Middle-earth, beyond the Mountains of Angmar, Gundabad and the Grey Mountains. The main known area was Forochel.
The location was also named Forodwaith (Sindarin, "Northern lands, people") after the hardy Forodwaith (people) folk, who inhabited it.
==History==
The Waste had been made very cold earlier in Ardas history because of the presence of Utumno and Morgoths evil cold emanating from it. The region remained cold even after Utumnos destruction.

The region was once inhabited by a hardy Men folk, the Forodwaith (people) who gave the region its name. However in later years (possibly suffering by the Witch-king of Angmar) their Lossoth retreated to the Cape of Forochel.
Dragons also dwelt in there and after many years they multiplied and became strong and made War of the Dwarves and Dragons against the Dwarves. Cold-drakes came from the Northern Waste and drove the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains out of their homes, and most of the Dwarves then moved to Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills.
According to Frodo Bagginss When evening in the Shire was grey, Gandalf had travelled to the Northern Waste.

In the earliest General Map of Middle-earth by Christopher Tolkien, the northern portion of the Westlands is featureless, labelled as "Northern Waste", with the name "Forodwaith", in smaller letters, above the Mountains of Angmar; this seemed to suggest that Forodwaith is a part of the wider Northern Waste, if not a smaller separate region. This nomenclature was carried over to Pauline Bayness A Map of Middle-earth.
Later, Christopher Tolkien realized that the two names are synonymous. The misunderstanding was corrected in the later map known as The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age, where only the name "Forodwaith" appears, labeling all the blank portion north of the Mountains of Angmar and the Grey Mountains.
