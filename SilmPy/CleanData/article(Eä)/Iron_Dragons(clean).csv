The  were creatures of iron and bronze forged by the smiths of Morgoth within the pits of Angband. They were only ever used against the peoples of Gondolin during its Fall of Gondolin. 
==History==
It was Maeglin who first conceived of the creation of monsters of fire and iron, and he brought this idea to Melko during his betrayal. When they came against Gondolin, they piled against the northern gate where the Orcs within would swarm into the breach.
Based on their descriptions, it can be said that the Iron Dragons were inanimate in nature. p. 213 They were made by the most cunning of Melkos smiths and sorcerers. Their iron was expertly linked, so that they could coil and crawl like slow rivers over difficult terrain. Within these devices were Orcs armed with scimitars and spears, ready to emerge at need. It is said that after their appearance at Gondolin, such devices would not be seen again until the Dagor Dagorath.

John Garth has speculated that the Iron Dragons were perhaps supposed to be partly allegorical of the tanks debuted in the Battle of the Somme.John Garth, Tolkien and the Great War
