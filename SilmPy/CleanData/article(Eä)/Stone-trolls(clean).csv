Stone-trolls were a race of trolls in the service of Sauron. Not much is known of these creatures, except that they inhabited the Westlands of Middle-earth and that they spoke a "debased form of the Westron". It is possible that they were not actually living beings, but mere counterfeits made by Melkor, and they would return to their stone images once exposed to the light of the Sun.
Bert, Tom, and William — the trolls encountered by Bilbo Baggins and his companions on their journey to Lonely Mountain — were likely of this kind, as they spoke Westron.Robert Foster (1978), The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 366
In , Samwise Gamgee composed the humorous poem "The Stone Troll", about Tom Bombadil visiting an old troll gnawing on the bones of Tim.

The three trolls attempt to trap and carry the Dwarves in bags. This is reminiscent to the scene in Beowulf (poem) where Grendel carries his human prey in a glove.
