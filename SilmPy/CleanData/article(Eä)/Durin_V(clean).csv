2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Durin Vs story is expanded on in a series of quests. During his reign, the dragon Thorog took Helegrod, a northern city of his kingdom located near the source of the Bruinen. Durin took up the axe Mírdanant, a gift from the elves of Eregion to his ancenstors, and led a small company of dwarves to reclaim the city. Durin and Thorog killed each other, and only one dwarf of his company survived to tell the story.
:Helegrod was left abandoned by the dwarves. Mírdanant was said to be blessed by the elves with words of protection, and so the death of the king while bearing the axe and its loss in the abandoned city was a source of tension between Durins Folk and the elves. A quest in the game involves reclaiming Mírdanant from the reanimated carcass of Thorog and returning it to the elves of Rivendell, who in turn return it to Glóin.
