The Floating Log was an inn in the village of Frogmorton, in the Shires Eastfarthing. The Floating Log stood on the East Road that passed through the Shire, about halfway between Hobbiton and the Brandywine Bridge, and so must have been a busy place. In the time of the War of the Ring, though, Sharkey and his Men took over the Shire, and shut the inn down.
