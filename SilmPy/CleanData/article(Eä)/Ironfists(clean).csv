The Ironfists were one of the seven houses of the Dwarves that dwelt in mountains of the East of Middle-earth. They were originally paired with the Stiffbeards., pp. 301, 322 (note 24)
It is possible that the Ironfists were among the "Houses of other Fathers" who sent troops to help Durins Folk in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.

1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
: The unnamed Dwarven tribes were given invented names in an early supplement. While these were published before the publication of Tolkiens late note on the name of the Dwarven houses of the East, it has been suggested that the Ironfists could correspond to Thel√≥rs tribe (as portrayed in Middle-earth Role Playing).Thomas Morwinsky, "A Brief History of the Dwarven Mansions", in Other Minds issue 4 (July 2008)
2002-5: The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game:
