__NOTOC__
Galathilion, the Tree of Tirion or Tree of Túna was a tree made by Yavanna for the Elves of the city of Tirion. It was made in the image of Telperion, as the Amanyar loved the White Tree most, although it gave no light.
It grew in a high open courtyard beneath the Mindon Eldaliéva and had many seedlings in Eldamar. From it came Celeborn, White Tree, the White Tree of Tol Eressëa; through which it became the ancestor of Nimloth of Númenor and the White Tree of Gondor.
Legolas noted that the Doors of Durin displayed the Tree of the High ElvesActually the :File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Doors of Durin.jpg, displays a pair of trees flanking the composition, not a sole tree; unless they are both taken to symbolize the "Tree of the High Elves". which probably represented Galathilion., entries "Emblems — Eldar", "Tree of the High Elves"
