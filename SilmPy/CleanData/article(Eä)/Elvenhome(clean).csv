Elvenhome almost always refers to Eldamar (which is "Elvenhome" in the Elves own tongue), the homeland of the Elves in Aman, which is its translation. 
The word also was a general term for a land inhabited by Elves. For example, an "Elvenhome" in the song about Beren and Luthien refers to Doriath, and an Elvenhome is mentioned in the Hobbit-poem The Hoard, which, in that context, probably referred to Nargothrond. p.116, entry "Elvenhome"
