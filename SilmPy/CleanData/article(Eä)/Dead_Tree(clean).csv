The Dead Tree ( - ; the wikipedia:Snag_(ecology) stood Third Age 3019) was planted by King Tarondor (King of Gondor). It was the third and last White Tree of Gondor. It died at the same time as Belecthor II the twenty-first Ruling Steward. 
For lack of a seedling, the Dead Tree was left standing in the Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith) of Minas Tirith "until the King comes"., p. 206. It stood throughout the following centuries and the War of the Ring. That was until King Aragorn found a new seedling on Mindolluin in 3019.
When it was replaced, it was removed from the court but was placed in the Rath Dínen with all the honour that would normally be accorded a fallen Kings of Gondor.
