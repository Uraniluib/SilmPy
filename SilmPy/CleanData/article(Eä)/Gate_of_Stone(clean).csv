The Gate of Stone was the second of the Seven Gates of Gondolin, standing half a league from the Gate of Wood.  It was in form a wall with two stone towers.  The gate was, in fact, a large, dark, and polished stone placed upon a pivot, above which was a bright lantern.  When pushed upon on one side, the gate would swing until perpendicular to its previous position.  This feature could doubtless be disabled in time of siege.  The guards of the Gate of Stone were robed in gray.  It followed the Gate of Wood and was followed by the Gate of Bronze.
