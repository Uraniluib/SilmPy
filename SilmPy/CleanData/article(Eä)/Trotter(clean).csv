In the earliest unpublished versions of The Lord of the Rings, the character who became Aragorn was called Trotter instead of Strider (Aragorn) and was a Hobbits instead of Man. His name was derived from the fact that he had wooden feet after being tortured in Mordor. The background of Trotter is explained in The History of Middle-earth, volume IX, Sauron Defeated.
