The Outer Void, or the Timeless Void, was a term used in various ways.
Cosmologically, it describes the uninhabited regions of (non)existence outside Time and Eä, the absence of the Flame Imperishable.
Morgoth used to wander in the Void to look in vain for the Flame Imperishable.
The Timeless Halls of Ilúvatar seem to be apart from the Void; Eä is created amidst the Void but is not a part of it. 
After his defeat in the War of Wrath, Morgoth was cast out into the Timeless Void "through the Door of Night beyond the Walls of the World", but legends predict that he will return to the World before its end. The Void thus in that context refers to the vast distant empty spaces of Eä. This was often confused by Elves and Men with the Void that existed before the creation of Eä.
Saurons spirit also entered the Void after The One Ring was destroyed.
It is also possible Gandalfs spirit entered the Void after his battle with the Balrog in Moria, as he "passed out of thought and time."
