The Vanyar (Quenya, pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin ) are one of the three groups of Calaquendi, along with the Noldor, and some of the Teleri (more specifically, the Falmari). They comprise most of those who did not leave Aman.
== Origins ==
According to legend, the clan was founded by Imin, the first Elves to awake in Cuiviénen, his wife Iminyë, and their twelve companions. At this time, they were called the Minyar (Q: "first ones", pron. ). However, it was Ingwë, the first Vanya to travel with Oromë to Valinor, who became their king. They were the first to reach Beleriand after the Great Journey. 
All of the Vanyar journeyed to Valinor before the beginning of the Years of the Sun, and remained there. They are said to have the greatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, and Manwë and Varda love them for this.
At first the Vanyar dwelt in Tirion with the Noldor but they loved the light of the Two Trees of Valinor and settled in the plains and woods Valinor or the slopes of Taniquetil. Ingwë is called High King of the Elves. He lives on Taniquetil beneath the halls of Manwë. 
Another notable Vanya was Indis, the second wife of Finwë and grandmother of Galadriel. It is from her Vanyarin blood that Galadriel gained the golden part of her famous silver-gold hair.
== Description ==
The Vanyar were the first and smallest clan of the Elves, being only fourteen in number in their beginning. p. 381 All among them had blond hair. Few of them were ever seen in Middle-earth, as they only returned for the War of Wrath.
==Names==
The Vanyar called themselves Minyar, "the Firsts", their ancient name. Another name was Ingar or Ingwer which means "Chieftains" (etymologically related to the name Ingwë). 
In Sindarin they were called Miniel.
The Vanyar also known under the name "Fair-elves", from the fair colour of their hair., Vanyar They were also known as the "Light-elves", and also as the "Spear-elves" for their love of spears, as opposed to the sword and shield of the Noldor and the bow and arrow of the Teleri., p. 215 footnote to §29
==Etymology==
The name Vanyar means "the Fair" in Quenya, referring to their golden hair. It seems to be from a primitive Elvish form bányâ, p. 351, p. 402 (stem BAN) but also from wanjâ (stem WAN), p. 383. The Teleri called them Baniai.
== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In the earliest versions of J.R.R. Tolkien legendarium (see: The Book of Lost Tales Part One), they were called Teleri, while the Elves known as Teleri in the published version of The Silmarillion were called Solosimpi.
In the late manuscript The Shibboleth of Fëanor (ca. 1968), the Vanyar are also called Ingwi. Christopher Tolkien notes that this might be the only use of the term since the The Lhammas (1930s), when Ingwi was a name for an early conception of the Lindar (that is, being the first clan of Elves, the house and people of Ingwë)., pp. 332, 356 (note 3)
