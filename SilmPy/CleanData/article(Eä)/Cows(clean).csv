Cows, also known by the archaic plural Kine and occasionally as Oxen, were pasture animals in Middle-earth.
==History==
Cows were domesticated for farm use in most of Middle-earth. They produced milk, which was used as a beverage in Gondor,, "The Siege of Gondor" and the Shire., "An Unexpected Party" Being generally stronger than horses, cows also pulled the heavier wagons and wains in Middle-earth., "Minas Tirith (chapter)"
Yet still, there were undomesticated oxen. The wild-oxen of the East were, according to legend, descended from the Kine of Araw, the herd of Oromë., "The Realms in Exile" Vorondil the Hunter hunted them in the far fields of Rhûn, and of their horns he made the Great Horn of Gondor, which served as an heirloom to the House of Stewards until its destruction.
==Inspiration==
Cows are a major source of food even in todays world. Their use as farm animals seems little more than logical. J.R.R. Tolkien spent most of his life in Oxford, and cows would also play a role in other stories, such as Farmer Giles of Ham, where the Giant steps on Farmer Giles favourite cow, Galathea.J.R.R. Tolkien, Tales from the Perilous Realm (2008 edition), "Farmer Giles of Ham"
The white oxen of Rhûn were likened by Tolkien to an wikipedia:AurochsWayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page 265, a bovine species common in the ancient and medieval world until its extinction.
==Etymology==
An "elvish" word for "bull" is mundo. The Sundocarme MBUD, which lists among its derivatives a Quenya word mundo meaning "snout, nose, cape",, root MBUD could perhaps be related to mundo.
In Qenya, the word for "ox" is yakko or yako, "cow" is yaksi or yakse. In Noldorin, "milch cow" is gach, "cow" is gacha, and "a yoke ox - bullock" is gagron. Other Gnomish names are mûs or mui ("cow"); muir ("heifer"); mû ("ox"), muin ("kine, cattle"); and mugli ("calf")., p. 105, pp. 36, 58
In Tolkiens juvenile language Nevbosh, the word for cow is woc, which is both the reverse of cow, and an alteration of the French word vache.http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/nevbosh.htm Nevbosh article in Ardalambion
