Quickbeam, or in Sindarin Bregalad, was one of the younger Ents of Fangorn Forest belonging to the people of Skinbark. His name was given because of uncharacteristic hastiness. 
The rowans-trees in his keeping (among them Carnimírië, Lassemista, and Orofarnë) suffered greatly at the hands of Sarumans Orcs, so he was the first ent to make his mind up at the Entmoot. He sheltered, in his Ent-houses, the two Hobbitss, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took while the other ents made up their minds at the entmoot. He played a great part in the Ents resulting Battle of Isengard on Isengard.
==Etymology==
The name Quickbeam was given to him because he was hasty for an Ent. His Sindarin name, Bregalad, means "quick (lively) tree", derived from  *BERÉK- having to do with "violence, suddenness" and galadh, "tree"., p. 82
Quickbeam and Quicken are actual English names of the "Rowans" or "mountain Ashes". It was not coincidental that "rowan" is mentioned in Quickbeams song., p. 762
