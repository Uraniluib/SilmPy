Bungo Baggins ( - , died aged 80) was a well-to-do Hobbits, and the father of Bilbo Baggins.  Father and son were so much alike, in looks and behaviour, that Bilbo seemed like a "second edition" of his "solid and comfortable" father.
==History==
Bungo was the eldest child of Mungo Baggins and Laura Grubb. He married Belladonna Took, daughter of the Gerontius Took, towards . Bungo and Belladonna had only one child together, the infamous Bilbo Baggins.
Apart from fathering Bilbo, Bungos other achievements were that he built and excavated the rather luxurious Bag End in the Hobbiton Hill in Hobbiton and that he laid down several bottles of Old Winyards wine that would be enjoyed by Rorimac Brandybuck after Bilbos Farewell Party and by the small party on 21 September  that Frodo Baggins gave before leaving Bag End.
Bungo had an aptitude for either remembering or coining proverbs.  Bilbo quoted his fathers sayings "third time pays for all" before making his first descent into Erebor and "while theres life theres hope" when leading the Dwarves down to Smaugs lair.
==Etymology==
The name Bungo was meaningless in contemporary Hobbitish Westron. It represented an original name Bunga.
