Dragons also known as the Great Worms were evil creatures seen mostly in the northern Middle-earth. They were greedy, cunning, seductive and malicious, probably a creation by Morgoth out of fire and sorcery sometime in the First Age.

===The origin and early history of dragons===
Seeing the strength of the Noldor in battle, Melkor realized that orcs alone were not sufficient to defeat his enemies. He therefore began to breed a new race of monsters: the dragons.How this was done is unclear.
The Father of Dragons was Glaurung, a mighty wyrm with a fearful intelligence and a powerful hypnotic gaze. Glaurung played an integral part in the fate of the Children of Húrin. Among his many crimes were the destruction of the Elf-realm of Nargothrond and a spell cast upon Nienor which stripped her of her memory. This eventually led her to a disastrous reunion and marriage to her long-lost brother Túrin. When Nienor learned the truth of Glaurungs plot, she flung herself to her death. Glaurung was finally slain by Túrin, who afterward committed suicide in reaction to Glaurungs plot.
At the Fall of Gondolin, Morgoths foul host included dragons, "many and terrible" including the fearful Beast of Gondolin.
During the War of Wrath, Morgoth unleashed a new terror upon Middle-earth – the winged dragons. Chief among these was Ancalagon the Black. Eventually slain by Eärendil the Mariner, Ancalagons fall crushed the towers of Thangorodrim. Many of the dragons were destroyed in the War of Wrath but some fled and survived into the later Ages.
===Dragons after the First Age===
It would appear that the dragons fled to the Northern Waste, far from the lands of Men and Elves. Over the centuries, the race of dragons continued to breed and repopulate, particularly in the Withered Heath, an area in between two spurs of the Grey Mountains.
In the late Third Age the dragons of the Withered Heath, stirred by the Necromancer, began to harass the Northmen and War of the Dwarves and Dragons with the Dwarves around the year  (Dáin I and Frór of Durins Folk were killed by a great cold-drake in ). It was perhaps in these wars that dragons swallowed four of the Seven Rings.
The most fearsome dragon of the Third Age was Smaug, who laid waste to the Dwarf-realm of Lonely Mountain and the nearby town of Dale. This devastated the area and sent Durins Folk into exile. Smaug remained in the abandoned halls of the Lonely Mountain for many years until the coming of Thorin and Company and their "burglar", the Hobbits Bilbo Baggins. This began a chain of events that led to Smaugs death at the hands of Bard the Bowman.
Although Smaug was the greatest of the dragons of his day, he seems not to have been the last of his kind as Gandalf told Frodo Baggins that "there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough to melt the Rings of Power", indicating the presence of other, lesser dragons.
==Characteristics==
The dragons were huge and longeval, with their lives spanning centuries. They shared a greed of treasure (especially gold), subtle intelligence, immense cunning, great physical strength, and their eyes and words had a hypnotic power called "dragon-spell". Those who did not wish to be compromised by a dragons speech did never give directly information, but talked vaguely and in riddles, since denying an answer, would anger it to violence.
Apparently, dragons came from eggs.: Glóin: "dragonet new from the shell"
It may be that dragons could sport horns. where Eärendil wielded a bows "made of dragon-horn"
While dragons were armoured with iron scales, they had a soft spot underneath, in the region of the chest, which could be pierced by blades or darts.: "But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes.": "dragons were softer underneath, especially in the region of the - er - chest".
===Means of locomotion===
Some dragons (Glaurung) crawled like snakes, yet had four legs, like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapodophis Tetrapodophis. These must have been the most common type of dragons in the First Age, since the winged fire-dragons only first appeared during the War of Wrath, while the winged Cold-drakes are only reported in Turambar and the Foalókë. These (such as Ancalagon and Smaug) could both walk on four legs and fly using wings. Breeds of wingless dragons did survive into later Ages.
===Fire breathing===
The Urulóki (singular Urulok&euml;, Fire-drakes) could breathe fire. It is not entirely clear whether the term "Uruloki" referred only to the first dragons such as Glaurung that could breathe fire but were wingless, or to any dragon that could breathe fire, and thus include Smaug.  
Dragon-fire (of the Urulóki) was hot enough to melt Rings of Power: four of the Seven Rings of the Dwarves were consumed by Dragon-fire, although it was not powerful enough to destroy the One Ring itself.
The dragons who could not breathe fire were known as Cold-drakes. Those were found mainly in Ered Mithrin.
