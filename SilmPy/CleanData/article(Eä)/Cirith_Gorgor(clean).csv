Cirith Gorgor was the point where the mountain ranges of the Ered Lithui and the Ephel Dúath met, to the north-west of Udûn (valley) and Mordor. It was sealed by the Morannon (Black Gate) and guarded by the two Towers of the Teeth, Carchost and Narchost.
It was also called the Haunted Pass of Cirith Gorgor, because of the evil that lurked there.
==Etymology==
Cirith Gorgor is Sindarin from cirith "pass" and gorgor "extreme horror".
