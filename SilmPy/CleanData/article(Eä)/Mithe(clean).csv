Mithe was a body of water in the Shire, the outflow of the Shirebourn river into the Brandywine. 
At the Mithe there was a landing-stage called Mithe Steps, from which a lane ran to Deephallow and so on to the Causeway road that went through Rushey and Stock.
==Etymology==
The name is obviously unrelated to the English verb Wiktionary:mithe meaning "hide, conceal, avoid".
Andreas Möhn has suggested that Mithe means "Place where two streams meet", derived from Old English Wiktionary:muþ or Wiktionary:gemyþ "river-mouth, meeting of streams". Möhn adds that Mithe "is evidently related to mouth and probably a derivative surviving in English place-names".
