The Moors of the Nibin-noeg were high uplands that rose between the Vales of Sirion and the Narog, northeast of Nargothrond., note 16  On the eastern side rose prominence of Amon Rûdh.  The moor was covered in thickets of aeglos (plant)., p. 128
The moorlands were associated with the Nibin-noeg because in ancient times they had been part of their lands. Nargothrond to the west had originally been delved by the Nibin-noeg,, p. 121 as had the chambers at the top of Amon Rûdh, known by the Petty-dwarves as Sharbhund before the coming of the Elves., p. 128
In the The Second Silmarillion Map the Moors were named Moors of the Neweglu., p. 182 F 6-7, 187 (note 26). The name Neweglu does not appear elsewhere, but it is close to the name Neweg, Neweglîn, one of the names of the Petty-dwarves found in the Narn papers., p. 187 (note 26).
