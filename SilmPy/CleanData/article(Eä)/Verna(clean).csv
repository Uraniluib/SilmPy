Verna was an obscure location in southwest Beleriand near the Mouths of Sirion.
Arvernien was named after it.
==Inspiration==
Verna does not appear in narration or any maps of Beleriand; J.R.R. Tolkien appears to have invented the name in order to explain the etymology of Arvernien., p. 19 Since Tolkien explains Arvernien as "Land beside Verna", geographically, Verna could refer to adjacent regions like the forest of Nimbrethil or Lisgardh.
==Etymology==
Verna could be related to Quenya feren which means "birch, beech tree", and if so, it could refer to the forest of Nimbrethil ("(forest of) silver birches").This connection was suggested by the Encyclopedia of Arda, and it referred to Arvernien, without acknowledging the existence of Verna as an independent wordhttp://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/arvernien.html. Another possibility is that it refers to a river, obviously Sirion, and comes from the SundocarmÃ« WER, "winding" (thus, "Winding River").David Salo, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/34598 Message 34598, Elfling
