Linhir was a town in southern Gondor, at the juncture of the River Gilrain and the River Serni, north of the Ethir Anduin. Through it passed the road from Pelargir to Ethring.
Angbor, the Lord of Lamedon, was here attacked by the Haradrim and Corsairs of Umbar during the War of the Ring. On 11 March , Aragorn and the Grey Company arrived at the town (with, of course, the Oathbreakers). Terror came upon their assailants and they fled. The Men of Lamedon fled as well; all save the stout-hearted Angbor. Eventually the Corsairs were driven back to Pelargir, where they were defeated.

2014: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:As in the book, Linhir was a city in the region of Central Gondor. It straddled the rivers Serni and Gilrain just past their confluence and therefore was built in both Dor-en-Ernil and Lower Lebennin, but was mainly considered part of the former. Three brothers, "Erchar", "Garvir", and "Herion", sons of the late "Comeldir", commanded the soldiers of Linhir following Aragorns passage. The brothers were commanded to defend the city, but Erchar and Herion instead attacked the enemy forces in Dor-en-Ernil, resulting in the deaths of many of their men. The brothers were later convinced to return, and when both sides recovered from the terror of the Oathbreakers the remaining Corsairs of Umbar and Haradrim launched a second attack. The Gondorians were again victorious but suffered heavy losses.
