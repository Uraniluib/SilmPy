==History==
About  many Stoors from Dunland entered and settled in the Eastfarthing. Throughout that Age, whenever Bree-hobbits visited the Shire, they mostly reached Buckland or the Eastfarthing, as these were closest to their home, and rarely ventured further west.
When Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took travelled from Bag End to Crickhollow much of their trek took place in the Eastfarthing, where they first encountered the Nazgûl and were protected by Gildor. Continuing eastward, the crossed the fields of the Marish and met Farmer Maggot before they left the Eastfarthing on the Bucklebury Ferry.
Upon their return from their adventures in the south, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Meriadoc Brandybuck discovered the evil afoot in the Shire when they entered the Eastfarthing. On the first night they stayed at the uncomfortable guard-house near the Brandywine Bridge. At Frogmorton the Travellers were “arrested” and the spent the night at the Shirriff-house. The next morning they journeyed westward and left the Eastfarthing.
==Culture==
By the time of the War of the Ring the inhabitants of the Eastfarthing were still mainly Stoors, especially in the Marish, and they were known for many peculiar names and strange words uncommon in the Shire. Some months of the Shire Calendar, in the Eastfarthing had different names, the ones used in the Bree Calendar.
In muddy regions, such as the Marish, Hobbits wore boots and were house-dwellers, like Farmer Maggot.
The Golden Perch inn was said by Peregrin Took to serve the best beer in the Eastfarthing.
