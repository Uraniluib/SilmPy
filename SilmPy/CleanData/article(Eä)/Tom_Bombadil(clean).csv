1955: The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series):
:Norman Shelley voiced Bombadil, and Tolkien thought his portrayal "dreadful". Goldberry was portrayed as his daughter, rather than his wife. 
1979: The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series):
:In this series, Tom was voiced by Bernard Mayes. Like Norman Shelley before him, he also voiced Gandalf.
1988: J.R.R. Tolkiens War in Middle Earth:
:Tom Bombadil can be found outside his house in the Old Forest.
1990: J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings Volume I:
:Tom Bombadil rescues the party from the Willow Man, and provides information, supplies, shelter, and side-quests for the party.  He later rescues the party from the Barrow Wights, and very briefly joins as a temporary playable character while inside the barrow.  His role runs almost directly parallel to the original, with some related passages of The Fellowship of the Ring quoted directly.  However, Goldberrys role is significantly changed to provide a quest for the party.
1992: Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series):
:When he adapted the 1981 The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series), Brian Sibley deeply regretted cutting Bombadil from the radio series.Brian Sibley, http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html The Ring Goes Ever On When he made Tales from the Perilous Realm into a radio series, he decided to change the section "The Adventures of Tom Bombadil". Rather than several (unadaptable) Hobbitish poems, Sibley adapted the chapters from The Fellowship of the Ring. Bombadil is voiced by Ian Hogg.
2001-2007: The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game:
:Although Tom Bombadil does not appear in The Lord of the Rings (film series), Decipher produced a card for the character. He was portrayed by Harry Weller-Chew.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Daran Norris portrayed Bombadil with a Scottish accent. His role is much like that in the book, and as one of the few characters in this video game, he keeps most of his songs. 
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:In the The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition), some of Bombadils poems are transferred to Treebeard, and so is his encounter with Old Man Willow.
2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:Bombadil is a summonable power. Once summoned, he can plow through enemy lines. His most powerful weapon is a "Sonic Song". As soon as Electronic Arts secured the rights to the books, it was decided that Tom Bombadil should be in it; his appearance is kept close to his description in the book.http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battleformiddleearth2/news.html?sid=6139678 The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle-earth II Q&A - Enter Tom Bombadil, http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot.com
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Tom can be found either inside or outside his house in the Old Forest. He helps the player track down crebain scouts possessing important information, and later arrives to rescue the player from the Barrow-Downs when (s)he gets himself in more than (s)he is prepared for, much like the Hobbits in the Book.
2012: Lego: The Lord of the Rings:
:Bombadil is a playable character.  He uses a trowel as a weapon and for digging in certain spots. Tom can be found in his house on the road to the north of Bucklebury Ferry in the forested area between Bree and the Shire. It is unclear if this forest is meant to be the Old Forest or not; it is in the right location, but the game never specifically names it and its physical appearance does not fit the books description.
