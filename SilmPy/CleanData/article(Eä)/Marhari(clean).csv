==Etymology==
Marhari is a Gothic name meaning horse-soldier. The first element is related to English "mare" (see mearas)., Note 6 The second  element -hari is a simplified version of Gothic -harya "armyman, warrior" (seen also in Vinitharya) to indicate a later age. 
In Old English this element became -here and is seen in the later Rohirric name DÃºnhere which translates as "hill warrior".
