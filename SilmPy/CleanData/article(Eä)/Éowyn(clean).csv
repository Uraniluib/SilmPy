==Analysis==
Just as MacDuff disconcerted http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Macbeth Macbeth by revealing he was not "of woman born", Lady Éowyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old prophecy by Glorfindel, fulfilling that the Witch-king would not be slain by a man. However, the Witch-king actually recited the prophecy incorrectly: he said that "no living man may hinder me," though the prophecy actually said that "not by the hand of man will he fall." Glorfindels prophesy, unlike his own version, implies that the Witch-king will not fall to a man. In Tolkiens writing, man and woman applies simply to the gender of any Middle-earth race. Only when he capitalised Man did it denote the race of Men. The Witch-king may not have realised that the prophecy meant only a male, thus, his moment of doubt and hesitation when he faced Éowyn.

1955-6: The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series):
:Olive Gregg provides the voice of Éowyn.
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Éowyn is briefly seen, but has no lines.
1979: The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series):
:Éowyn is portrayed by Karen Hurley.
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:Éowyn is voiced by actress Nellie Bellflower. She appears unintroduced, but Merry fills Pippin (and so the spectator) in on the details. She is not terribly wounded, and appears healthy beside Faramir at the coronation.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Elin Jenkins plays the part of Éowyn. She is introduced much earlier than in the book when Gandalf escapes from Isengard and borrows a horse from Theoden. Unlike some adaptations her recovery in the Houses of Healing, and the blossoming of her relationship with Faramir are included. She is last encountered in the penultimate episode gifting Merry the horn he would blow later during the scouring of the Shire.
2002-3: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Éowyn is portrayed by Miranda Otto. Jacksons adaptation shows two different explanations for Éowyns injuries after fighting the Witch-king. In the Theatrical Release, her wounds are less severe than in the book; she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. In the extended scenes of the Extended Edition, she is near death: her brother finds her and grieves, and later we see her being healed in the Houses of Healing, where she shares a tender moment with Faramir.
