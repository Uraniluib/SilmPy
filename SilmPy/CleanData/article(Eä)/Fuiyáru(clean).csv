Fuiyáru was a deadly nightshade that grew about the Halls of Mandos. It is said to have been particularly abundant before the doors of Nienna., p. 14
==Etymology==
The name Fuiyáro is Qenya, likely a literal translation of "nightshade". Its composition probably relates to the elements Fui (also hui) "fog, dark, murk, night", and yaru (also yara) "gloom, blight". The Gnomish name of the flower was Fuior.
==Inspiration==
Patrick H. Wynne has identified the flower as the Wikipedia:Atropa belladonna.
