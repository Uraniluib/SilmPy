Rats were creatures often found in filthy and unfriendly places of Middle-earth. A specific breed of rats seems to have been the "brown water-rat", mentioned in Hobbits poetry.
"Rat" was also commonly used as a humiliating nickname. ("I saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat.") ("What have you to say, you descendant of rats?") ("Id make you squeak, you miserable rat.") (nickname: "...that little frightened rat..."; "...those stinking Morgul-rats"; "You up there, you dunghill rat!") (nickname: "Then youll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.")
