luine (pl. luini) is a Quenya word meaning "blue"., p. 66
The word occurred mainly in Exilic Quenya Quenya; the Vanyar in their Vanyarin used ulban for blue, adopted and adapted from Valarin.
==Examples==
*Vardo tellumar nu luini "beneath the blue vaults of Varda" (Namárië)
==Cognates==
*Sindarin luin
==Other versions==
In some linguistic manuscripts, J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with luine being a cognate of Sindarin duin ("river"), but noted that luine as meaning "river" was not used. Patrick H. Wynne has suggested that  luine meaning "river" perhaps only survived in compounds as -duinë (cf. Nunduinë#Etymology)., p. 31
