__NOTOC__
ONO is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme. 
ON/NO (or ONO/NŌ) signifies "beget/be born". NŌ (or NO) signifies "generation, people, folk, large group regarded as of common ancestry"., pp. 26, 168, 170-171 (root appearing as "ON/NO", "√ONO/NŌ", "NO; NŌ." and "√NŌ")
While ONO shortly is explained as signifying "beget, give birth to", a longer signification is given as "family, tribe or group having a common ancestry, the land or region in which they dwelt"., pp. 387, 413 (root appears as "*ONO") The latter signification shows the blending with NDOR.

===NŌ-===
In the Qenya Lexicon appears the root NŌ-, signifying "become, be born"., p. 66
===NŌ-, NOWO? (NONO?)===
Also in the Qenya Lexicon appears the root NŌ-, NOWO? (NONO?), signifying "ahead, in front; after, of time; tomorrow" (one of the derivatives is Qenya nuo "tomorrow"). Patrick H. Wynne therefore connects this early root to the late Quenya word noa ("tomorrow" or "yesterday")., p. 34 (note 23)
