The Took family was the pre-eminent clan of Hobbits in the Shire, being wealthy and having held the office of the Thain for centuries.  ("Took" was pronounced like "Two-k", not like "book" or "took" as in the past tense of "take").
==Territory, origins and customs==
Tooks were mainly of Fallohides Hobbit stock, and had quite a reputation for unusual behavior (among other things being more adventurous than the other Hobbits), a quality not valued in the Shire. For this reason they were seen as less respectable. An absurd legend among other families, was that one of the Took ancestors married a fairies. The Istari Gandalf was a known, if disreputable, associate. Bilbo Baggins and Meriadoc Brandybuck both had Took mothers.
 
The majority of the Tooks lived in the Great Smials of Tuckborough and in the surrounding area of Tookland, which lay in the Westfarthing.  A smaller clan called the North-took Family who lived far up in Long Cleeve; these were descendants of the legendary hero Bandobras Took.
As was customary in traditional hobbit families, the head of the Took family ruled the clan with his wife, thus upon his death, she continued to rule as the matriarch of the family. Such was the case with Lalia Clayhanger who succeeded her husband, Fortinbras Took II, to clan leadership. However, the Thainship passed only through male descent, so her son, Ferumbras Took III, was the Thain immediately after his father’s death.
Took men usually were given high-sounding names which evoked battles, weapons or figures of legend, like Gerontius, Fortimbras or Isembold. Razanur Tûk (Pippin) was named after Razanur, a mythical traveller. Took women had names of jewels, or exotic or mythical flowers.
==History==
The first recorded Took was Isumbras Took I, who in  became the 13th Thain of the Shire after Gorhendad Oldbuck crossed into Buckland and became the Master there.   Thereafter Isumbras Took was known as Isumbras I and the office of the Thain became hereditary within the Took family.
Excavation of the seat of the Took family, the Great Smials, was begun  in  by Thain Isengrim Took II.
Bandobras Took, the "Bullroarer", defeated an Orc-band in the Northfarthing in .
In  his descendant Peregrin Took became the 20th Thain of the Took line, the 32nd in the Shire.   In  Thain Peregrin I handed his office to his son, Faramir Took I and rode away from the Shire (later it is said that he and Meriadoc Brandybuck were laid to rest beside the bed of Aragorn after his passing).
In the Fourth Age the Great Smials became an important repository of historic books and records.

==Family Tree Notes==
==Etymology==
Tûk was an older name of unknown meaning in Hobbitish Westron.
Took is a Welsh surname, referring to a type of sword. One of the earliest spellings of the Hobbitish form of the name in The History of Middle-earth (Tūca) matches the Welsh spelling for this name/sword,Mark T. Hooker, Tolkien and Welsh, pp. 126-127 which suggests that Tolkien apparently was aware of the Welsh meaning.
==Inspiration==
The inspiration for Elvish blood amongst the Tooks may have possibly come from the Tollkühn family intermarrying with nobility:


The inspiration for the name Took may have come from Tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy".
