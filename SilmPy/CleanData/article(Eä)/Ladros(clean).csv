Ladros was a highland region to the northeast of Dorthonion. It was held briefly as a fief by the House of Bëor, but lost to Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach ("Battle of Sudden Flame").
==History==
The region of Ladros seems originally to have been a fief of Finrod (at least, his brothers Angrod and Aegnor held "the northern slopes of Dorthonion"). Finrod later assigned this land to Boromir (Lord of Ladros) of the House of Bëor, whose members had long been loyal in his service. Boromir became Lord of Ladros.
Of the House of Bëor, there were three lords of Ladros — Boromir himself, his son Bregor, and Bregors son Bregolas. In Bregolas time, Morgoth overwhelmed Dorthonion and Ladros in the Dagor Bragollach, in which Bregolas himself was slain. His brother Barahir and Barahirs Outlaw Band, became outlaws in their own land, assaulting Morgoths forces from their hidden lair at Tarn Aeluin on Ladros southern borders. They were betrayed by Gorlim the Unhappy,(who was himself deceived by Sauron into divulging the Outlaws whereabouts.) and all were slain but Beren, who escaped into the south. 
After this time, Ladros fell under the yoke of Morgoth until it was swallowed by the Belegaer at the end of the First Age.
