Carn Dûm was the capital and chief fortress of the Witch-kings realm of Angmar., Carn Dûm  It was located at the western end of the Mountains of Angmar, the north-western extension of the Misty Mountains.
 
==History==
Around  the chief of the Nazgûl came north to found the realm of Angmar, seeing hope in the disunion of Arnor while the southern kingdom of Gondor remained powerful.  The Witch-king, as he became known, established Carn Dûm as his capital and populated it with Men of Darkness, Orcs, and other fell creatures.
 
Allying with the Hill-men of Rhudaur, the Witch-king in Carn Dûm sent forces that resisted the claim of Argeleb I of Arthedain of lordship over all of the former lands of Arnor.  Clashes resulted and in  Argeleb was slain. Arveleg I, the son of Argeleb, with strength from Cardolan and Lindon, repelled Rhudaur and Angmar from the Weather Hills and established an uneasy, fortified frontier.
 
In  a stronger host commanded from Carn Dûm invaded Cardolan, surrounded Weathertop, and killed Arveleg.  Again a coalition of Arthedain (now ruled by Araphor, son of Arveleg I) and Lindon contained the menace.
 
The kingdom of Arthedain perished in the Fall of Fornost in .  However, in  the Witch-kings forces were driven north-east after the Battle of Fornost by the cavalry of Gondor and destroyed.  Glorfindel of Rivendell drove off the Witch-king himself.
 
The host of Gondor left no Man or Orc alive west of the Mountains.  On the eastern side in  Frumgar led the Éothéod into the North and they drove the last remnants of Angmar away.  At this time then Carn Dûm was wholly abandoned. While it is possible that Carn Dûm was repopulated after , when Orcs began making secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains, its name was never mentioned again in any histories.
==Etymology==
The etymology of Carn Dûm is uncertain and it could be any from the Elvish or Mannish languages.
Dûm is a Khuzdul word meaning "halls, mansions". The name Carn Dûm therefore could be Khuzdul (suggested by its proximity to nearby Gundabad) but J.R.R. Tolkien used K for this language instead of C.
In The Return of the Shadow, "Carndoom" appears as an early name of Dimrill Dale which, according to Tolkien, means "Red Valley". This corresponds with Sindarin carn "red" and tûm "valley". (note 13, p. 433) 
David Salo favours the Sindarin interpretation of "red valley", and provides the name as an example of the few Sindarin phrases where the adjective precedes the noun (others being Sarn Athrad and Sarn Gebir)., p. 102 Otherwise, neither words carn and dûm have been attested (carn could be a short form of caran possibly also seen in carcharoth, "red maw")
Another suggestion, is that the name roughly translates as "mountain fortress" in wikipedia:Gaelic;http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/carndum.html Carn Dûm at the Encyclopedia of Arda although Tolkien uses Celtic elements for some translated Mannish names, this would have been the only instance where he uses Gaelic. It is unknown whether this is just coincidence or not.
