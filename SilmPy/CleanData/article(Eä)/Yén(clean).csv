Yén (plural yéni, line 2) is Quenya for "long year" or "great year",, p. 62 (forms yén, yéni, and yēn) and was a unit of time used by the Elves of Middle-earth after the first rising of the Sun. Compare with a Valian Years, the unit of time used in Valinor.
:1 yén = 144 solar years = 52,596 days
J.R.R. Tolkien used Valian Years to measure the passing of time in the Elder Days as recorded in the The Annals of Aman, but such a Valian Years equals 9.582 solar years = 3500 days (in older versions, the The Lost Road and Other Writings, it equals 10 solar years).
