Valmar or Valimar (Quenya, pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin ) was the city of many bells in the heart of Valinor where many of the Valar and Maiar dwelt. It lay on the Girdle of Arda in the east-central part of the Plain of Valinor, west of Taniquetil. 
The Two Trees of Valinor grew nearby on the mound of Ezellohar. It is said that the houses in Valmar had roofs of gold and their floors silver and their doors were of polished bronze; and that they were lifted with spells and their stones were bound with magic.
== Etymology ==
The name Valmar means "dwelling of the Valar" (from Valar and -mbar = "dwelling").
