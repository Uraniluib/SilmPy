Umbarto was a Quenya Amilessë given to Amras son of Fëanor by Nerdanel his mother after the insisting of the former that he have a different mother-name than Ambarussa, his twin.  Umbarto meant, prophetically, the fated; Amras was accidentally burned alive in the ships of the Teleri at Losgar during the Return of the Noldor.  Because of its meaning, Fëanor had quickly urged Nerdanel to change it to Ambarto, but while she relented, she said that nevertheless Umbarto would be its true form.  Amrod echoed this after the tragedy that took Amras life.
