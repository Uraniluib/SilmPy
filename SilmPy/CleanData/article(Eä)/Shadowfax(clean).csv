Shadowfax was a mighty Horses of Rohan, the chief of the Mearas, noted for its speed, "like an arrow".
==History==
In September  Gandalf was in Rohan and Théoden reluctantly gave him any horse of his choosing. At first the horse did not allow him to come near and Gandalf had to follow him far over the fields for two days before he tamed it. It carried him throughout the War of the Ring without bridle or saddle. With it Gandalf rode to the Shire and then followed Frodo Bagginss trail to Bree, Weather Hills and Rivendell. In February of Third Age 3019 Shadowfax returned to Edoras.
Shadowfax came alone to Gandalf in the outskirts of the Fangorn Forest and he introduced the horse to the Three Hunters. Hasufel and Arod recognised it as their chieftain. Shadowfax carried Gandalf and Gimli to Edoras. The horse was able to run from Edoras to Minas Tirith almost without stopping, and his ground speed rivaled the flying speed of the fell beasts of the Nazgûl. Shadowfax was at the Grey Havens with Gandalf when he sailed on the White Ship. Shadowfax, as one of the line of Nahar, presumably was with him when sailing for the West.
Shadowfax also possessed extraordinary courage.  He was the only free horse in the world capable of standing before the Witch-king during the Siege of Gondor instead of fleeing.This reference excludes horses used by the forces of Sauron such as the horses ridden by the Nine Riders.
==Etymology==
It is an anglicized form of Old English Sceadu-faex having shadow-grey mane (and coat). It does not actually occur in Old English. Fax is an obsolete English word., pp. 762-3
