Eregion (Sindarin, pron. ) or Hollin was a sub-realm of the Noldor Elves in Eriador during the Second Age, located near the Walls of Moria under the shadow of the Misty Mountains. It was the only lasting Noldorin realm outside Lindon.
==History==
Eregion was founded by the Noldor who left from Lindon early in the Second Age.
Its capital was Ost-in-Edhil, which was founded in .
The Elves of Eregion lived in harmony with a Dwarves civilization, trading freely with their kingdom of Moria, or Hadhodrond in the Sindarin. A high road ran from Ost-in-Edhil to Khazad-dûm, and an unprecedented friendship between the two races began in that time. Eregions jewel smiths achieved the highest levels of craftsmanship since Fëanor. 
Eregion was populated by Noldor, and for a while ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn, until they left for Lothlórien on the other side of the Misty Mountains. It was then ruled by Celebrimbor, a descendant of Fëanor. Under his rule the Elves of Eregion became friends with Annatar, the "Lord of Gifts," and created the Rings of Power. When Annatar was revealed as the Dark Lord Sauron, the Elves of Eregion tried to keep the Rings from falling into Saurons hands, but only managed to rescue Vilya, Narya, and Nenya (the Three Rings of the Elves).
 
Sauron returned to Hollin with a vengeance in , and despite the assistance of the Dwarves, he Sack of Eregion it. The survivors fled to Lindon, Lothlórien, and the refuge of Imladris (Rivendell). The doors of Moria were shut and sealed, and Celebrimbor was slain.
In the Third Age, Eregion was a pleasant but unpopulated land.
