tharni is a Westron word which means "quarter". Dependant on where it was spoken, it has two meanings:
* A division of the Shire. It was translated Farthings in the text., p. 45
* In Gondor, it was a silver coin (Sindarin canath), worth one fourth of a Castar, or Mirian.
==Etymology==
It has an older form tharantīn, from possible Adûnaic *tharan "four".
