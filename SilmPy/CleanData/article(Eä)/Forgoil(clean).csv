The Forgoil, or the Strawheads as it reportedly translated in Westron, were the enemies of the Dunlendings. In the rest of Middle-earth, they were known as Rohirrim. 
==Etymology==
Forgoil is the only known word in the language of the Dunlendings. It is possible that the final part of the word, -il, is a plural marker, such as in the case of Westron il cf. mûmakil (which is perhaps Haradric); similar formation with the ending -li is also seen in Quenya.Helge Fauskanger, "http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/mannish.htm Various Mannish Tongues", Ardalambion There is also a possibility of a plural formation with infixion from *forgol
The (possible) element go has been tied to the Pre-Númenórean word Go-hilleg,J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Peoples of Middle-earth, "Tal-Elmar (chapter)" which is untranslated, but refers to the Númenóreans. It could mean "head", in this sense.Roman Rausch, "http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/Drughu.htm Tar-Elmar and the Drughu tongue", http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/ Sindanórië However, both these interpretations remain speculation; J.R.R. Tolkien never left any notes on the subject.
