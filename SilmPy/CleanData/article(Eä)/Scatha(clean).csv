Scatha the Worm was a mighty Long-worms of the Grey Mountains and one of the greatest Dragons to infest that range of the north.
==History==
Little is known of Scathas life, except that he possessed a great hoard, stolen from the Dwarves. He was slain by Fram son of Frumgar in the early days of the Éothéod. 
His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the Men of the Éothéod and the Dwarves of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." It was rumored that for this insult the Dwarves killed him.  
It seems like Frams people retained at least some of the hoard, and Eorl brought it south when they settled in Rohan. The Horn of the Mark that Éowyn gave to Meriadoc Brandybuck after the War of the Ring many hundred of years later was said to come from Scathas hoard.
