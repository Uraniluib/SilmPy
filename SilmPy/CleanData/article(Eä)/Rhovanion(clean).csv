Rhovanion or Wilderland was a large region of northern Middle-earth. The Great River Anduin flowed through it, and the immense forest of Mirkwood was a part of it.
Properly speaking Rhovanion was the name of a small region east of Greenwood, which later was the Kingdom of Rhovanion, but the name was used for all of Wilderland by the late Third Age.
Many wild horses and wild kine roamed the plains of Rhovanion.
==History==
=== First Age ===
In the First Age the Elves passed through it during the Great Journey, and much later the Atanatári (Fathers of Men) followed them. It is not otherwise mentioned until the Second Age.
=== Second Age ===
Rhovanion played host to two Silvan Elves Elf kingdoms ruled by Sindarin lords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (or Lothlórien).
The great battlefield (or Dagorlad) of the War of the Last Alliance against the host of Sauron lay in the south of Rhovanion, and in the Gladden Fields of the Great River the High King of Gondor and Arnor, Isildur, son of Elendil, was killed.
=== Third Age ===
In the early Third Age, it was a quite populated area: in the north lay the Dwarves kingdoms of Lonely Mountain and the Dwarf halls in the Ered Mithrin, and the Mannish kingdom of Dale, in the north of the Great River Anduin lay the Mannish realm of Éothéod, and in and around the south and east of Greenwood the Great lived the Men of Rhovanion.
In  Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged. The King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of Gondor served in his army. Vidugavias daughter Vidumavi married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar (King of Gondor) in , which led to the Kin-strife in . Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and with a Rhovanion army he reclaimed his Kingdom in .
In the north of Greenwood lived the Silvan elves ruled by Thranduil, and in the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled Amdír and later Amroth. In the far south, near the great falls of Sarn Gebir, watched the northern guard of Gondor, and in the valleys of the Anduin lived Stoors (Hobbitss).
In  the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half its people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in  the Wainriders overran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but in  Rhovanion revolted, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from the west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of Rhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant relatives.
In circa  Sauron returned as the Necromancer he took residence at Dol Guldur in the south of Greenwood. And Greenwood became evil, and was renamed Mirkwood. The Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale were destroyed and scattered when the Dragons Smaug took Erebor, and Gondor retreated from the Falls. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably the Beornings and the Men of Lake-town upon the Long Lake. The Men of Éothéod removed south at the invite of Gondor, and settled the plains of Calenardhon, later Rohan. After being driven out of Erebor the Dwarves relocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the Ered Luin in Eriador.
At the end of the Third Age, the Kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were restored as a result of the death of Smaug and the Battle of Five Armies, and Sauron was removed from Mirkwood by the wizard Gandalf. During the War of the Ring it held off an invasion by Saurons forces, and after Sauron was defeated Mirkwood was clean again, and renamed Eryn Lasgalen, or "Wood of Greenleaves". Some time during the Fourth Age Gondor claimed large parts of it.
