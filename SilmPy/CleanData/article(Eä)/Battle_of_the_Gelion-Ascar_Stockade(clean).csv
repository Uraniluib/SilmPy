The Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade was a battle fought about  between Orcs of the Ered Luin and the Haladin under Haldad.  The Orcs laid siege to the Gelion-Ascar Stockade, where the Haladin had retreated upon their initial attack.  The food of the fortress ran out, and Haldad made a sortie in which he and his eldest son, Haldar, were killed.  His daughter Haleth held the Haladin together for another ten days, until Caranthir came to rescue them.  The Elf-lord drove away the Orcs, saving the besieged.
