File:Narfil Palùrfalas - House-of-the-King.jpg

The House of the King was one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondothlim, under the personal command of King Turgon in Gondolin.  They wore white and gold and red, and their emblems the moon and the sun and the Scarlet Heart.  During the Fall of Gondolin, the Kings House was untouched until all the houses were gathered again at the Square of the Palace, for they had remained there during the fighting at the North Gate of Gondolin.  But after Gothmog (balrog) was slain by Ecthelion, they hurled themselves upon the Orcs, and even slew two score Balrogs.  They forced one of the terrible Fire-drakes into the Fountain of the King, and it perished, though the water did also.  But many of them were killed by the heat, the serpents, the enemy, and one another, for the steam that rose from the fountain obscured their view.  But a body of them saved the king, and there was a rally of men beneath Glingal and Belthil.  No more is said of this house, but they probably perished with Turgon.
