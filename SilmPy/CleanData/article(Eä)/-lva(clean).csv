-lva is a pronominal ending in Quenya meaning "our", of two persons where one addresses the other. Only attested in the genitive -lvo in the word omentielvo. For this reason it has been argued that the ending may actually be *-lwa, since there is some evidence that wo would change to vo in Quenya and the w of *-lwa could be derived from the dual ending -u.
