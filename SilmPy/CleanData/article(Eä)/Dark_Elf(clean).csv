When Melian set her Girdle of Melian around the land of Doriath, Thingols kinsman Eöl left that land, and dwelt instead in the forest of Nan Elmoth. Living under the dark shadows of that ancient forest, and preferring the night to the day, he came to be widely known as the Dark Elf.
Eöls epithet was no doubt influenced by the fact that the Sindar to whom he belonged were of the Moriquendi, the Dark Elves who had never seen the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.  It is debatable that the Dark Elves referred in the case of Eöl not to the Moriquendi but to the eastern elves who hated the sun.
The question of Eöls title is addressed in the following margin note by Tolkien:
