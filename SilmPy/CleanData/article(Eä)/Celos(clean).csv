The Celos was a lesser river or stream that flowed out of the White Mountains into the Gondorians land of Lebennin, a little to the west of Minas Tirith. It was a tributary of the larger River Sirith.
==Location==
The smaller-scale map that accompanies The Lord of the Rings and Unfinished Tales shows the Celos flowing into the Sirith from the east, while the large-scale contour map of Gondor shows it flowing from the west. A brief reference in Unfinished Tales suggests that the Celos was the next river eastward from the Gilrain, which would make the large-scale map correct.The rivers name on that map, incidentally, is spelled Kelos, but the pronunciation is the same in either case. Christopher Tolkien noted the error of the small-scale map in The Treason of Isengard; the correct location of the Celos is thus being the western tributary., p. 322 (note 9)  
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name Celos derives from the Sundocarme KELU ("flow out swiftly") + ending -sse, -ssa. The Quenya cognate is kelussÃ« ("freshet, water falling out swiftly from a rocky spring")., p. 11

2014: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The river Celos was located between Lower Lebennin in the region of Central Gondor and Upper Lebennin in the region of Eastern Gondor. The river Sirith joined it to the east, below the Warning beacons of Gondor of "Sirthanc". The village of "Erynos" stood across from the mouth of the Sirith, on the western bank of the juncture. South of the meeting of the rivers the combined river flowed south through the city of Pelargir and into the Anduin. The Celos was the domain of the lighthearted River-maid "Silverfroth", one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the time of the War of the Ring.
