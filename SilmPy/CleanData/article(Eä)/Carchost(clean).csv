Carchost was the eastern of the two towers that flanked the Black Gate of Mordor (otherwise know as the Morannon).  Together, Carchost and its counterpart Narchost were known as the Towers of the Teeth or even the Teeth of Mordor.  They were originally made by the men of Gondor but in the later Third Age they had been long abandoned by the Gondorians and were overrun with evil. Sauron used them as watch towers to guard Mordor, protecting it from the very nation which had originally built them.
