kundo is a Quenya word for "guardian"., p. 260
Helge Fauskanger has suggested that Tolkiens manuscript note "cundo lord", p. 117 is a related gloss, also in Quenya. The latter form conforms to the orthography used in The Lord of the Rings (where Tolkien represented the k-sound with the letter "c").
