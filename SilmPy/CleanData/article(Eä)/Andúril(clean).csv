Andúril was the name for the sword Narsil after its reforging in Third Age 3018 for Aragorn, the heir of Isildur. 
==Appearance==
Its blade had engraved the designs of Seven Stars between the rayed Sun and the crescent Moon, symbols of Elendil, and his sons Anárion and Isildur. It also had many cirth. Its blade was notably brilliant, justifying its name.
==History==
Narsil was a symbol of the kingship of Arnor and Gondor, but was broken at the end of the Second Age. Its fragments remained a heirloom for the Kings of Arnor, and the Chieftains of the Dúnedain. 
Boromir, son of the Stewards of Gondor, travelled to Rivendell for the Council of Elrond because of the prophetic dream of his brother Faramir. The dream told him to "Seek for the Sword that was broken".

Finally, after three thousand years, when Aragorn set out for the War of the Ring, Narsil was reforged by Elven smiths of Rivendell, and Aragorn renamed it "Andúril". 
Aragorn carried the sword during his journey south as part of the Fellowship of the Ring, and fought with it, the Sword That Was Broken or the Sword Reforged. When entering Meduseld he initially refused to surrender it to Doorward Háma and entered a long argument with him, until convinced so by Gandalf.
Already famous during the War of the Ring, Aragorn often used the sword to help establish his credentials as the Heir of Isildur and the throne of Gondor. This was especially true when he convinced the Oathbreakers to fulfill their oath to support Gondor in its time of need.
== Etymology ==
Andúril means "Flame of the West" in Quenya,, p. 34 (form: Andūril) composed of andúnë, "west" and ril, "brilliance"). "West" here refers to Númenor.
==Inspiration==
Broken swords that are reforged are also seen in the Volsungasaga and the Nibelungenlied.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Narsil is reforged after Rivendell, though this reforging is not shown. Neither Narsil nor Andúril are named.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Narsil is reforged after Rivendell, and Aragorn carries Andúril thereafter.
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Because of Aragorns warrior-persona in this video game, Andúril merely serves as a melee weapon upgrade after Rivendell.Connie Veugen, "A Man, lean, dark, tall: Aragorn Seen Through Different Media", published in Reconsidering Tolkien (edited by Thomas M. Honegger (http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/10975/1/Aragorn_Final.pdf read in PDF))  Aragorn does not use the broken sword at any point prior. Notably, the swords blade is constantly illuminated; it glows red during the day, and blue at night. In the games credits, artist Jason Rosenstock is explicitly mentioned as the designer of Andúril.Vivendi, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), User Manual, page 22, "Aragorn Sword Design"
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:In The Two Towers, when asked by Háma to disarm outside Meduseld, Aragorn is very reluctant, saying that normally he would give up his weapon, "if I bore now any sword but Andúril".J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, "The King of the Golden Hall" This scene and dialogue is omitted from the film on the grace that the sword Aragorn surrenders there was not Andúril. 
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Andúril is not forged from the shards of Narsil until late in the third film. Elrond had the sword reforged only after Arwens pleading. He then took the sword to Aragorn in the camp of the Rohirrim at Dunharrow. Aragorns acceptance of the sword, along with his decision at that time to take the Paths of the Dead, showed his willingness to accept his destiny of becoming king. 
:In the The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition), the Mouth of Sauron refers to the blade as Elvish; this could either be a reference to its reforging or a mistake on behalf of the writers.J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens (adaptors), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition), "The Mouth of Sauron (scene)"
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The reforging of Narsil is experienced by the player in the quest arc called "The Blade that was Broken". The player sets out to find the last of the Silithair, shining adamants crafted by Elves of the house of Fëanor in days of old, in order for the Elf-smiths of Imladris to reforge the sword into Andúril.http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Quest_Arc:The_Blade_That_Was_Broken Quest Arc: The Blade That Was Broken, Lorebook, lotro.com
