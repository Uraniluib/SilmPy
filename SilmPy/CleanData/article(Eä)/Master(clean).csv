Master was a title used for many people, the most prominent being Tom Bombadil, whose jolly and riddling songs gave him mastery over all things in his domain.
Other characters who have also been honoured with this title include:
* Frodo Baggins was called "little master" by Barliman Butterbur and Master by both Samwise Gamgee and Gollum, the latter case due to Frodos ownership of Gollums precious: the One Ring.
* The elected civil leader of Lake-town upon the Long Lake was called Master of Lake-town.
* The Uruk-hai Ugl√∫k used the title of his own Master, the Wizards Saruman.
