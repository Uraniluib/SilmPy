Tumhalad was a field in West Beleriand that lay between the Narog and its tributary, the Ginglith. Here the army of Nargothrond, led by Túrin and Orodreth, fought the Battle of Tumhalad, a last desperate defense against an onslaught led by the Dragons Glaurung. The Elves were overrun and Orodreth, King of Nargothrond, was slain.  Túrin carried the dying Gwindor from the battle before speeding back to the defense of Nargothrond.
