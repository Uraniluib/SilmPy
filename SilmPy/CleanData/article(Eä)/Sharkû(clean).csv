sharkû is an Orkish word meaning "old man"., p. 763Robert Foster used the form sharkú in his The Complete Guide to Middle-earth (see entry for Sharkey). Modified to fit the Westron (and anglicized in The Lord of the Rings) it was rendered as "Sharkey", used by the Orcs and Men of Isengard as a nickname for their leader, the Wizards Saruman., p. 658
==Etymology==
Andreas Möhn has suggested that sharkû might be derived from a hypothetical Mannish Sundocarme ZAR. The ending could be identified with the ending seen in Gandalf#Names.
