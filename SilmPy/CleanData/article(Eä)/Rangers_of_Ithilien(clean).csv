The Rangers of Ithilien were a Gondorians special operations force, selected from the descendants of the people who had dwelt in Ithilien before it fell from Gondors control. Dressed in camouflaging green and brown, they crossed the Anduin in secret to harass the forces of the Enemy in Gondors old domain and used several secret retreats in the region.
==History==
It is likely that the Rangers of Ithilien were established at the same time that Henneth Ann청n was built, in  when most of the remaining inhabitants of the region departed due to Uruk-hai attacks from Mordor. The Rangers main task was to harry Saurons forces whenever they entered Ithilien.
At the time of the War of the Ring the leader of these Rangers was Faramir, son of the Ruling Steward Denethor. Other Rangers at that time were Damrod, Mablung (ranger of Ithilien), and Anborn.
On 7 March , Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee witnessed a harassing attack by the Rangers of Ithilien upon a regiment of Haradrim marching north.  The two hobbits were captured by Faramir and other Rangers and brought to Henneth Ann청n.  Faramir learned of the The One Ring carried by Frodo and captured Gollum, but on 8 March he let the three go to seek entry into Mordor.
Faramir and the Rangers of Ithilien left Henneth Ann청n on 9 March.  The Rangers fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  When the Army of the West marched through Ithilien on its way to the Morannon, a powerful force of Orcs and Easterlings tried to ambush its leading companies, but the Rangers of Ithilien, led by Mablung (since Faramir was recovering in the Houses of Healing) trapped the ambushers and destroyed them.
After the defeat of Sauron it may be that the Rangers of Ithilien became the White Company, the guard of Faramir, who became the Prince of Ithilien at the command of King Aragorn., p. 326, entry "Rangers of Ithilien"
