The castar, or Sindarin mirian, was the chief currency in Gondor. A smaller coin was the tharni or canath, a silver coin worth a fourth of the castar.
==Etymology==
Westron castar bears a striking resemblance to the Hobbitish word kast and Rohirric kastu, which mean "mathom". Sindarin mirian seems to be derived from m√Ær, "jewel".
