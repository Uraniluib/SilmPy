Aldalómë is one of the names of the Fangorn Forest, used by Treebeard in his song In The Willow-meads Of Tasarinan. The other names mentioned by Treebeard are Ambaróna and Tauremorna.
J.R.R. Tolkien notes in his Unfinished index that it means tree-twilight, and refers to Quenya words alda tree and lómë dimness, twilight, night (quoted in Scull - Hammond, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 385).
