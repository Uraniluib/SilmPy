The Little Lune was the Western tributary to the river Lh√ªn. It originated from the Ered Luin probably after the War of Wrath.
The Little Lune was the Northern border of the Lindon and North of it was Dwarf country., p. 313 One named Dwarf realm that lay beyond was that of Thorins Halls in the late Third Age.
It was just a few miles south of the Little Lune that the ancient Dwarf city of Belegost was located.
