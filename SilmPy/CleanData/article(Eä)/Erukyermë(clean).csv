The Erukyermë was one of the Three Prayers held on the summit of the Meneltarma in Númenor (the others being the Erulaitalë and the Eruhantalë). The Erukyermë was held at the beginning of each spring. The ruling King of Númenor or Ruling Queen of Númenor, followed by a silent crowd, would climb the mountain on foot, and at its peak utter a prayer for the approaching year. Traditionally, three Eagles, known by the Númenóreans as the Witnesses of Manwë, would hover over the King and his people at this time.
It was just after the Erukyermë of  that Tar-Meneldur, the sixth King of Númenor, surrendered the Sceptre to his son Tar-Aldarion. (note 16)
Since Erukyermë marked the beginning of a new year, this points to the existence of a separate calendar for religious purposes, beginning at vernal equinox. For civil matters the Edain started the year in the middle of winter, just after Yule, a tradition attested as far back as the First Age.
