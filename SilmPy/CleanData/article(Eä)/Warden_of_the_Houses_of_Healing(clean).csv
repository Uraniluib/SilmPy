The Warden of the Houses of Healing was a character mentioned in the last stages of The Return of the King. He was a Gondorian who was in charge of the Houses of Healing.
== History ==
Not much is said of him, and no name has been given to this character.
He seems to have annoyed both Gandalf and Aragorn due to his tendency to get into a prolonged discussion about the herbs, herb-lore and other lore; in the mean time, he had shown his ignorance concerning the healing properties of athelas, which by that time had been almost forgotten, save those of the few who still remembered the lore of the Elder Days.
Sometime later, when Éowyn has been healed (at least bodily-wise), the Warden counselled her to take rest for at least a week from now, but Éowyn was determined to go beyond the Houses of Healing, and in one of her wanderings she met Faramir, and conversing with him for a while, she set all the dreams of her past deeds to naught. And so began the love of Faramir the Steward of Gondor and Éowyn the Shieldmaiden of Rohan.
At that tidings the Warden of the Houses of Healing was rejoiced, and his heart was uplifted.
== Notes ==
* Warden of the Houses of Healing was the title given to the chief healer of the Houses of Healing in Minas Tirith, a position of some power and authority.
* Although the title of the Warden of the Houses of Healing refers to a broader category, the Warden of the Houses of Healing in The Return of the King is, no doubt, an individual character.
