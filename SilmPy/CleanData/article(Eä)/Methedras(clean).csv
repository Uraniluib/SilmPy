  
Methedras (Sindarin for "Last Peak") was the southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains. Upon its eastern slopes sprang the Entwash River, which flowed into the western edge of Fangorn Forest, growing about the base of the mountain.
 
To the south, Methedras stood above Isengard in the valley of Nan Curun√≠r.  The sources of the Isen River were upon the mountain.  On 3 March  the Ents diverted the waters of the Isen to flow into Isengard, flooding its pits and creating a lake about the tower.
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the draft version of "The Riders of Rohan", Methedras was named Methen Amon.  This name would be changed to Methendol before the final name of Methedras was adopted., note 18
