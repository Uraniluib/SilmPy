A Telco is the straight stem line that appears in written Tengwar, which can extend above or below the writing line (although in the original system there was a third option, a telco that extended both above and below the line). Combined with the lúva (bow) stroke, it forms the basis of all the standard characters of the Fëanorian alphabet.
