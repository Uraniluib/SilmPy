Hobbiton Hill, usually called simply The Hill, stood to the north of the town of Hobbiton.  Bag End was tunneled into this hill by Bungo Baggins.
The earth removed in excavating Bag End was shot over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground forming the Bagshot Row; it became the gardens and earthwalls of the other dwellings., p. 765
