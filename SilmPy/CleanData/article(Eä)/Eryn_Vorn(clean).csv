Eryn Vorn (Sindarin for Blackwood) was a wooded cape in Eriador, and a region of dark pine trees.
==History==
Located in western Minhiriath, Eryn Vorn (likely named so by the Númenóreans) was originally part of the vast ancient treescape that covered most of north-western Middle-earth. During the Second Age, however, these forests were decimated by the Númenóreans in their greed for ship-building timber, before being almost completely burnt down by the forces of Sauron during the ensuing war in Eriador.
By the latter half of the Second Age, the surviving natives of Minhiriath had retreated either north to Bree, or hidden themselves in Eryn Vorn which was probably all that remained of the vast forests in Minhiriath for long years thereafter. 
From , Eryn Vorn nominally formed a part of Cardolan and by the end of the Third Age, scattered woodlands had reappeared in much of the rest of Minhiriath. 
It is probable that people remained hidden in Eryn Vorn by the Third Age. Although Bree was the westernmost permanent settlement of Men by the late Third Age, the woods of Minhiriath were home of a few, secretive hunter-folk at the time of the War of the Ring. These wild people were afraid to cross the river Baranduin because of the Elves who dwelt beyond.These Elves surely are the Elves of Lindon, the realm located north of the cape.
==Etymology==
Eryn Vorn is Sindarin and has been given the translation "Blackwood". The name consists of eryn ("wood") and vorn ("dark"),, p. lxv the latter being the lenition form of morn.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin - the Noble Tongue: I. Soft Mutation" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 8 June 2011)
The name Eryn Vorn first appeared on Pauline Bayness Map of Middle-earth (1970), for which J.R.R. Tolkien had supplied notes on additional names. The first printing of the map wrongly has Erin Voru.
