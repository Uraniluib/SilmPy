 
Ilmandur was supposed to be eldest of the three sons of Elendil, who only appears in the third version of the manuscript of "The Council of Elrond" where Elrond tells how the sons of Elendil governed  the three cities of Gondor, but Tolkien struck out the name in pencil., p. 119
According to Christopher Tolkien, Ilmandur was probably meant to be the lord of Osgiliath, as Ilmen in his name means the realm of stars, giliath in Sindarin, present in the name Osgiliath., p. 122
