Haldir was an Elves of Lothlórien, probably a Silvan Elves, and a marchwarden who guarded the forests northern borders. 
==History==
Haldir was one of the Galadhrim; unlike his brothers, Rúmil (elf of Lórien) and Orophin, Haldir had traveled outside Lórien and knew Westron. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on Telain in the trees. 
Haldir was accompanied by his brothers between 15 February and 16 February,  when they encountered the Fellowship of the Ring who arrived in Lórien. His brothers interacted little with the Fellowship because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated Gimli rather poorly due to bad relations between Elves and Dwarves. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until Galadriel said he did not have to. 
He had heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had met before. Haldir became their guide to the city of Caras Galadhon. 
After Celeborn and Galadriel had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Haldir led them to their Elven boats.
