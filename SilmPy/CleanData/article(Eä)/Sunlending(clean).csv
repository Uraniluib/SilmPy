:Not to be confounded with: Sunlands, the name of Harad in the Westron
Sunlending was the name used by the Rohirrim of the land of An칩rien, Sun-land. It is mentioned in the song From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning, l. 15: "six thousand spears to Sunlending".
The name Sunlending did not refer to the climate, but was rather heraldic, as An칩rien was immediately attached to Minas Anor. Sunlending was thus connected to the name and the emblem of An치rion, brother of Isildur., p. 776
