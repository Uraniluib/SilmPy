Mindon Eldaliéva was the tower of Ingwë, the High King of the Elves, which was built upon the summit of Túna in the city of Tirion within the Calacirya. The city had many towers of white stone and the highest was the Mindon Eldaliéva, surmounted by a silver lamp whose beams radiated far into the mists of the sea.
==History==
The Eldar raised the hill of Túna and constructed the city of Tirion and the tower of Mindon upon it in . In , Yavanna gave the Noldor the tree Galathilion, the image of Telperion (although it gave no light of its own), and the Elves planted it in the great court beneath the Mindon.
The house of Finwë fronted the great square below the Mindon, and it was in this house that the unrest of the Noldor manifested itself in  when Fëanor drew his sword upon Fingolfin and accused him of usurping his place and the love of his father.
In  when Morgoth and Ungoliant stole the light of Valinor and the Silmarils, Fëanor came to the court below the Mindon. There he voiced his grievances against the Valar, persuaded great numbers of the Elves to return to Middle-earth, and swore (with his seven sons) the Oath of Fëanor. While those of the House of Fëanor did not look back as they began their march, many of the noblest and wisest did glance behind as Tirion receded, and the lamp of the Mindon Eldaliéva was their last sight of their city.
As the Elves marched, a dark figure appeared upon a rock and proclaimed the Doom of Mandos. Although Fëanor and great numbers of his followers ignored the prophetic curse, Finarfin repented and returned, to behold once more the beam of the Mindon in the darkness.
== Etymology ==
