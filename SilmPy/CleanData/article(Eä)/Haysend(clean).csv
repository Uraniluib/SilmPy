Haysend was the village at the southern tip of Buckland, at the place where the River Withywindle flowed out of the Old Forest into the Brandywine. It was named for the fact that it stood at the end of the High Hay, the Hedge raised to protect the Bucklanders from the strange things that lived in the Forest and beyond it. 
According to the poem "Bombadil Goes Boating", its inhabitants had a more fierce and protective attitude than most Hobbits, which is hardly surprising given the perilous location of their village.
