Tintallë, meaning "the Kindler", was the original title of Varda, derived from her making of the first faint stars in ancient times.  Much later, after she used the dews of Telperion to kindle much brighter stars, the Elves called her Elentári, the Queen of the Stars.
When the Fellowship of the Ring left Lothlórien, Galadriel lifted her arms and sang a song in final farewell in which she referred to Varda as Tintallë. (Exert of song below)
"An sí Tintallë Varda Oiolossëo
ve fanyar máryat Elentári ortane,
ar ilyë tier undulávë lumbulë"
Translation: For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds,
and all paths are drowned deep in shadow
