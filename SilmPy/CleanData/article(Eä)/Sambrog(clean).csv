Sambrog is a character created specifically for The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar. He is the Wight-lord of Othrongroth and was summoned by the Witch-king of Angmar. It is unknown if he created him or just called for his presence. The Witch-king summoned him to slay some Free peoples who overheard of their plans. Yet, Tom Bombadil sang a song which vanished the Barrow-wights before he could do so. Chapter 11: "Othrongroth"
