Ingil (as was his name in the earlier stages of development) was the son of Ingwë#Other versions of the legendarium in the The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation). He was among the Elves who came to Tol Eressea. He rested upon Kôr with other Elves and built a tall grey tower. The dwelling was called Koromas, but was later known as Kortirion, in memory of their ancient dwelling of Kôr in Valinor which also upon a hill and had a similar tower.
Meril-i-Turinqi said that long ago he returned to Valinor and is with Manwe. He became a blue bee to follow Telimektar and is seen among the stars as Nielluin (Sirius).
In later versions of the Silmarillion, this character is named Ingwiel in most of the references, and in at least one instance he is mention to lead the Valinorean Noldor to the War, instead of Finarfin. Only in one of his last references his name was altered to Ingwion, which is used in this article.
