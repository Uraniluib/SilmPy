Anghabar (Iron Delvings; ang "iron" + habar "delved mine") was a mine in the northern part of the Echoriath, or Encircling Mountains of Gondolin. It was Maeglins questing for precious ores in the mountains that led him to discover a rich seam of hard iron in the northern part of the range. From the mine of Anghabar, that iron was extracted and used to increase and improve the arms of Gondolin, ready for the desperate and destructive battles in the closing years of First Age.
