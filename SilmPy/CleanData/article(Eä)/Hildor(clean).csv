Hildor was one of the many names among the Elves for the race of Men, meaning "the Followers" or "the Aftercomers"., pp. 386-7
==Etymology==
Hildor is a Quenya word, and contains an influence from the Sundocarme KHILI ("follow"). In the The Etymologies, and in the manuscript Parma Eldalamberon 17, appears the Quenya form hildi ("followers = mortal men"; "after-comers"), derived from the Sundocarme KHILI#Other versions., p. 364, pp. 101, 103
Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the unattested singular form of plural Hildor should be Hildo.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 16 June 2011)
