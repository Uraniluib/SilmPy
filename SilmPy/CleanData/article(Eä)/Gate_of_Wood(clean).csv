The Gate of Wood was the first gate of the Seven Gates of Gondolin.  It was placed at the end of the secret passage and the beginning of the Orfalch Echor, in an arch bordered by pillars.  It was essentially a wooden portcullis that rose upon being touched in a certain place, an attribute which may have been cancellable in the case of siege.  It was followed by the Gate of Stone.
