Odo Proudfoot ( - ) was a Hobbit of the Shire.
==History==
Odo was the son of Bodo Proudfoot and Bilbo Baggins aunt, Linda Proudfoot and gave rise to a line of Proudfoot Family (or, as Odo himself preferred, "Proudfeet"). 
Odo was among the guests at the famous Bilbos Farewell Party at which Bilbo Baggins disappeared. At that time, he was an elderly hobbit indeed, being ninety-seven years old. He only lived for a few more years after the Party, but from him had come at least two generations of descendants, including his mischievous grandson Sancho Proudfoot, who attempted to excavate for treasure in Bag End.
==Etymology==
The name Odo was meaningless in contemporary Hobbitish Westron. It represented an original name Oda.
