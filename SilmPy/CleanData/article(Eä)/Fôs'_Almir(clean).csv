In early versions of the legendarium, Fôs Almir (the Bath of Flame), also called Faskalan, Faskala-númen (the Bath of the Setting Sun) and Tanyasalpë (the bowl of fire), was a purifying bath into which Túrin and Nienor entered., p. 138 (§2), pp. 115-6
The bath was fashioned as a great basin with golden floor and walls of polished bronze. An "arcade of golden pillars topped with fires engirdled it" and Yavanna "set a great and nameless Magic around it, so that therein was poured the most of the waters of the fruit of the noon and it became a bath of fire"., p. 187
