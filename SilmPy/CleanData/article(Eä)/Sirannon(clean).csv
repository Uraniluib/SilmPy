The Sirannon, or Gate Stream, was a stream in Eriador.
==Course==
Beginning at the Celebdil, it flowed past the Doors of Durin, the gates of Moria (hence its name) to Ost-in-Edhil, the old capital city of the Noldor of Eregion, where it joined the river Glanduin. Along the river, from Ost-in-Edhil to Moria, ran an ancient road.
The Sirannon dropped over the Stair Falls beyond the gates of Moria, and its sound was heard from miles around.
==History==
On 13 January  (by which point both Moria and Eregion had long been abandoned), the Fellowship of the Ring found that the Sirannon had been dammed by someone or something, and before the gates of Moria there was now a foul lake. In this lake dwelt the Watcher in the Water, who nearly caught the Ring-bearer Frodo Baggins.
Moria was eventually resettled by Dwarves during the Fourth Age, therefore the Sirannon was probably cleansed.
==Etymology==
The name obviously means "stream-gate"., p. 360 The Westron name Gate-stream is its translation.
