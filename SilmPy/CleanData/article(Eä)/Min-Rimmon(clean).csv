Min-Rimmon was one of the seven Warning beacons of Gondor of Gondor, on the northern flanks of the White Mountains.  It was the fifth beacon west of Minas Tirith and was the highest peak in a group of crags known as the Rimmon. With Eilenach and Amon DÃ®n, Min-Rimmon was one of the oldest beacons, set in place even before the foundation of Rohan.
On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
==Etymology==
mindon means "peak" in Sindarin, p. 511, thus Min-Rimmon refers to the "Peak of the Rimmon".  "Rimmon" is a name of forgotten origin, coming from the Second Age before Gondor was established.
