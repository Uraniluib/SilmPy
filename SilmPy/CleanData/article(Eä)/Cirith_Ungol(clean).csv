Cirith Ungol was located on the north shoulder of the Morgul Pass. These two passes through the western mountains of Mordor were the only way towards the land from the west.
Cirith Ungol was guarded by the Tower of Cirith Ungol, built by the Men of Gondor after the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was fought. 
During the War of the Ring, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were led up the Stairs of Cirith Ungol to this pass by Gollum to the lair of the giant spider Shelob, who dwelt there.
It is not known whether the pass and the tower were called Cirith Ungol when the Men of Gondor held it.
