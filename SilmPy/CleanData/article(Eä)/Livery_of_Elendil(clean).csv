The Livery of Elendil were a number of symbols used by the Realms in Exile and their decendant kingdoms, Gondor and Arnor. It consisted of the Seven Stars, the Crown of Gondor and the Nimloth (tree). Upon Arnors fall and the failing of the line of the Kings of Gondor the crown was largely dropped from usage and not until the coming of Aragorn, and the raising of his banner at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, was the crown used again.
