Dagnir (died ) was a member of Barahirs Outlaw Band.
__NOTOC__
== History ==
Dagnir fought in the Dagor Bragollach under the command Barahir. He was part of a small group of men loyal to their lord that survived. The survivors formed a small band and lived as Barahirs Outlaw Band in Dorthonion, near Tarn Aeluin. 
They lived in hiding for some time, until Morgoths agents captured Gorlim and coerced him into giving the location of their hideaway. Orcs were sent to raid it, and succeeded. Dagnir and the other outlaws were killed. Only Beren survived, as he had been away on an errand.
== Etymology ==
The Sindarin name Dagnir means "slayer" (or "bane") from dag + (n)dîr, cf. Dagnir Glaurunga "Glaurungs Bane".
