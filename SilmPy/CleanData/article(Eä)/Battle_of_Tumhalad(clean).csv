The Battle of Tumhalad was the last battle of the Elves of Nargothrond. It was fought on the plain of Tumhalad between the Narog and its tributary, the Ginglith.
==Prelude==
The battle was fought as result of a massive Orcs-buildup beneath the Ered Wethrin and in the Pass of Sirion. Messengers from Círdan brought these tidings and a message from Círdan concerning a warning from the Valar Ulmo that the Elves of Nargothrond should not fight in open battles against the armies of Morgoth.
However Túrin, a Men and an influential commander of Nargothronds forces, urged King Orodreth to venture out and fight the forces of Morgoth.

==The Battle==
The Elves of Nargothrond, though, were not used to open battle for they had always waged a guerilla war, ambushing but never assaulting the forces of Morgoth. Also, the evil hosts were larger than anticipated and led by the Dragons Glaurung. 
The forces of Nargothrond could not withstand the assault and were driven towards the plain of Tumhalad, where most of them, including King Orodreth and the Elf-lord Gwindor, were slain. Only Túrin withstood the attack of Glaurung, as he wore the Dwarves-crafted Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin.
==Aftermath==
The defeat suffered by the Elves allowed the Sack of Nargothrond by Glaurung.
Elven casualties undoubtedly were very high, given that Nargothrond is totally erased with this defeat and unable to continue forth even in a weakened state, like how Doriath did after the Battle of the Thousand Caves. The few survivors fled to Doriath, the Isle of Balar or possibly rallying to the  futile defence of Nargothrond itself.
