Barad Eithel (Sindarin "Tower of the Well") was the mountain fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, thus the seat of the High Kings of the Noldor (until the Nirnaeth Arnoediad).  
It was set in the eastern foothills of the Ered Wethrin, at Eithel Sirion, the source of the River Sirion. It was here that the Nirnaeth Arnoediad took place, and where Fingon was slain, giving Morgoth the chance to take control over the chief stronghold of both Mithrim and Dor-l√≥min.
==Etymology==
The name Barad Eithel is Sindarin meaning "Tower of the Well" referring to the Wells of Sirion; from barad "tower" and eithel "well".
