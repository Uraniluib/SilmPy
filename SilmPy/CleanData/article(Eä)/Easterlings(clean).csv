The Easterlings were Men who lived in the East of Middle-earth, and were enemies of the Free peoples. 
== History ==
===First Age===
In the First Age, Men Awakening of Men in Hildórien in the East. Some of them were early corrupted by Morgoth, prompting others (the Edain) to migrate westwards.
Centuries later, after Dagor Bragollach, tribes of Men joined the Edain in Beleriand, long after their arrival. These Easterlings (First Age) came from the east, probably Eriador and were also called "Easterlings". Two of their leaders were Bór and Ulfang.
===Second Age===
In the Second Age Sauron escaped the judgment of the Valar and continued his former masters work, turning the Men of the East and South to evil and dominating them. Under the authority of the Dark Lord, many towns and walls of stone were built, and those under his influence became numerous and armed with iron. To these men, Sauron was feared as a king and god. During the Dark Years Sauron dominated most of the Westlands, and when Sauron was driven back to Mordor, he continued his expansions eastwards gaining servants and worshippers.
===Third Age===

After Saurons defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, these "Wild Men" were released by his tyranny but they still had The Darkness in their hearts. Evil and restless, they battled against each other and some withdrew to the hated west. Thus they encountered the lands of Gondor and since then, tribes brought trouble periodically with several attacks and migrations. Even Northmen often assailed Gondor for a long time.
They first enter the records of Gondor in  attacking Gondor from the plains between the Sea of Rhûn and the Ash Mountains. Tarostar managed a first victory against them in . In  they invaded Ithilien but Turambar (King of Gondor) destroyed the horde and conquered a new territory in Rhûn for Gondor.
In the following centuries the Easterlings cease, while Gondor was free to extend its borders to South Gondor. That was until the days of Narmacil I when the Easterlings resumed their attacks, even some greedy Northmen joined them. In  an Easterling army marched in the lands between Rhovanion and the Sea of Rhûn. Forces from Gondor - aided by Northmen of Rhovanion - defeated them and destroyed their camps and settlements east of the Inland Sea.
After this defeat the Easterlings disappeared from the Gondorian records for some period, during which Gondor was again occupied with the south and the Corsairs of Umbar.
=== The Wainriders ===
During that time tribes of Easterlings form the confederacy known as the Wainriders (q.v.) who would trouble the Kingdom and the Northmen. 
Gondor was weakened by the Great Plague and the Wainriders defeated the Gondorian army in , raided the lands of Rhovanion and enslaved its people. Some of these lands eventually were reclaimed by King Calimehtar (King of Gondor). 
In  the Wainriders, allied with the Haradrim of Near Harad and the Variags of Khand, managed a brief victory against Gondor, despite the assistance by the Éothéod; eventually they were Battle of the Camp in their camp during their celebrations. 
After this defeat the might of the Wainriders was broken although still held Rhovanion, and they retreated east. Most importantly, King Ondoher and both his sons were slain in that assault, an event that led to the extinction for the line of the Kings of Gondor. 
In  the Necromancer (who was actually Sauron) retreated from Dol Guldur for some centuries. That period was known as the Watchful Peace for the Westlands, but during that time Sauron retreated to the East and managed to create a strong alliance between the various tribes of Easterlings.
===The Balchoth===
The Balchoth were a fierce race southeast of Mirkwood, under orders of Dol Guldur and no doubt related to the Wainriders. In  they and Orcs overran the plains of Calenardhon and almost destroyed the army of Steward Cirion, but were defeated by the Éothéod.
In  some Easterlings renewed their attacks and entered the new-founded Rohan. Thus Eorl fell fighting in the Wold.
During these struggles Sauron reclaimed Mordor unnoticed in .
=== War of the Ring ===
Easterlings serving Mordor fought in the War of the Ring alongside the Haradrim and Variags. They appeared in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of Dale.
In the Fourth Age some Easterlings were subdued by Aragorn and King Éomer.
== Culture ==
The Easterlings were in general more primitive than Gondor. They were motivated by Sauron to hate Gondor and seek its riches. 
Troops mentioned in the Easterling forces aiding Sauron in the Third Age included swordsmen, spearmen, horsemen, mounted archers, and chariots ridden by chieftains.
The weapons that the Easterlings used were primarily crude, jagged spears, making them especially effective against cavalry, as well as a shorter, odd, glaive-like version used for close combat. 
Some like the Wainriders and the Balchoth had large chariots, wagons and wains which they used to run their foes down, as well as live in and used to fortify their camps. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Easterlings were bearded and used axes.
