Fenmarch was a region of eastern Rohan that stretched from the Firienholt along the Mering Stream, and therefore marked part of Rohans eastern border with Gondor.
==Etymology==
The fen element of the name means "marsh" and is a reference to the wetlands along the Mering Stream. March is an old word for "borderland" - a reference to the border with An√≥rien - and has the same derivation as Riddermark, a name for the whole country of Rohan.
Note that J.R.R. Tolkien writes that on reflection he would have preferred the form "Fenmark", to the extent that he recommended this alternative version for translated versions of the book., p. 770
