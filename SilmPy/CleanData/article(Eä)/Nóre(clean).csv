__NOTOC__
nóre (or nōre) is a Quenya word used for "land associated with a particular people"., p. 413 (note 25), p. 26 
Originally it meant "people", but it was blended and confused with the quite distinct root ndor "dry land" (cf. Sindarin dôr) and the suffix forms -nórë, -ndórë or -dórë are also seen shortened to -or.
In the early manuscript the The Etymologies, Quenya nóre is glossed as "country, land, race"., p. 378

*ONO blended with NDOR
==Examples==

*Valinor = Valinórë (strictly "the people of the Valar") and Valandor ("the land of the Valar")
*On the other hand, Endórë, Endor = ENED + NDOR
