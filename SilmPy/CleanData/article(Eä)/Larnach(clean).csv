Larnach was one of the woodmen who dwelt in the Forest of Brethil, south of the River Teiglin. These people were harried by the Gaurwaith outlaws from Doriaths western borders, and in a raid by these outlaws, Larnachs daughter was rescued by Túrin, under the alias of Neithan., 104
In his search for Túrin, Beleg later came upon the fenced homestead that was Larnachs home, and was told the story., 108
