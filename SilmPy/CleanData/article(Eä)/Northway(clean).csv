The Northway was a road in the Shire. It is named as such only in the 1960 rewrite of The Hobbit, published in The History of The Hobbit: Return to Bag-End, so it may not be considered canonical., p. 815
The road sprang from the Great East Road just west of Frogmorton, crossed the Water, and led to Oatbarton.  A side-road branched off just before the Northway reached the Northfarthing and stretched to Dwaling and Brockenbores. On the intersection stood an inn, the All-Welcome Inn.
