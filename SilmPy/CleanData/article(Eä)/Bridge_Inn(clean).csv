The Bridge Inn was an inn on the West side of Brandywine Bridge in the Shire.  It was torn down by the Ruffians during the War of the Ring, and replaced with a guard house.  Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took were arrested here by the Shirriffs when they returned home from their adventures.
