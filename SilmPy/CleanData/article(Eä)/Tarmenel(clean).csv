__NOTOC__
Tarmenel was a term that clearly translates as "high heaven", though as it only appears in one of Bilbo Bagginss rhymes, it is hard to be sure exactly what the term referred to. In Elves cosmology, the world was enfolded in different layers of airs, and it seems that Tarmenel was a term for the highest or outermost of these - the "Over-heaven".
==Etymology==
Tarmenel is a Quenya name, described as signifying "true firmament",, pp. 19, 22 apparently consisting of tar + menel.
