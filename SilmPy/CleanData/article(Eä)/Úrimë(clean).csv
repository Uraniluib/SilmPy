Úrimë (Urui in Sindarin) was the eighth month of the year in the Kings Reckoning and the Stewards Reckoning of Gondor, following Cermië, and preceding Yavannië. In the New Reckoning it was the fifth month of the year.
Úrimë in the Kings Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards Reckoning) corresponded to Wedmath in the Shire Calendar (approximately modern 24 July through 22 August).
