The Eglath ("The Forsaken") were the Teleri Elves (Eldar) of the Great March who decided to stay in Beleriand seeking their lost leader ElwÃ« (Thingol). The main host of the Teleri followed Olwe on their way to Aman.
The Eglath eventually became the Sindar with Thingol as their King.
==Etymology==
The name comes from Sindarin verb egla plus the plural ending -ath.
