:Not to be confused with Mardil
Madril was Faramirs second in command in The Lord of the Rings (film series). He is played by John Bach.
==History==
Madril was a Ranger of some experience. He helped Faramir in his ambush of Haradrim in Ithilien, where they also captured Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee. After a short stay at Henneth Annûn, the company moved on to Osgiliath to reinforce its garrison.
Despite initial doubts, the Orcs held off an attack. Madril sent scouts to Cair Andros to see if there was any enemy activity in the North. However, the Orcs crossed the Anduin in Osgiliath with boats, and Faramirs men were caught unawares.
The orcs overpowered the Gondorian troops, and at Madrils advice, Faramir called for a retreat. During the call, Madril was badly wounded. He was left behind in the evacuation. As he lay dying, Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul) stabbed him with a spear, killing him outright.
