Sharku was an Orcs invented for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. He was played by Jed Brophy.
==History==
Sharku was one of the Wargs-riders who ambushed the column of Rohan women and children retreating from Edoras to the safety of Helms Deep. Th√©oden and his guard, with the help of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, fended off the attack. However, during the battle Aragorn got tangled in the harness of Sharkus Warg and both the beast and the ranger fell off a cliff. Sharku, mortally wounded, survived just long enough to gloat about Aragorns (supposed) death to Legolas and Gimli.
==Etymology==
Sharku means "Old man" in Black Speech.
