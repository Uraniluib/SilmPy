The South Undeep was one of two westward bends of the river Anduin located between The Wold and the Brown Lands (the other being the North Undeep).  The South Undeep was the smaller of the two bends.  Both of the Undeeps had many shallows and wide shoals that afforded an easy crossing for armies, which occurred a number of times during the history of Gondor and Rohan.
