File:David T. Wenzel - Raft-elves.jpg
The raft-elves brought goods on the Forest River between the Woodland Realm and Lake-town. The goods were stored in barrels which were tied together and then poled or rowed up the river. Sometimes they also used flat boats, on which the goods were loaded.
The term "raft-elves" is mentioned only once, so likely these elves pertained to Thranduils Elves of Mirkwood.
