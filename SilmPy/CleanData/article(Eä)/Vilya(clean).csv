Vilya (Quenya, pron. ) or Wilya (pre-Second Age and Vanyarin, ), as a proper noun, was one of the Rings of Power made by the Elves of Eregion.  Vilya, Nenya, and Narya were the Three Rings, more powerful than the rings given to Dwarves or Men.  Like the other Elven Rings, Vilya was jeweled: it contained a great blue stone set in a gold band, which contributed to its titles as the Ring of Sapphire and the Blue Ring.  A lesser-used title of Vilya was the Ring of Air, signifying its pre-eminence even over the other Rings of the Elves; it was generally considered that Vilya was the mightiest of these three bands.
==History==
By , Celebrimbor, the lord of Eregion, had forged all Three Rings independently of Annatar, a guise of the Dark Lord Sauron.  As a result, none of the Three were stained by his evil.  However, like all the Rings of the Elves, Vilya was still under Saurons influence when he wielded The One Ring, which held dominion over all the others.
When Sauron made his Ring in , Celebrimbor became aware of his designs and in  gave the Three Rings to Elven guardians, with Vilya sent to Gil-galad in Lindon.  Sauron waged war against the Elves in Eriador but was eventually defeated.  Afterwards, Gil-Galad gave Vilya to Elrond, who bore it through the later years of the Second Age and all of the Third Age.
Upon Saurons destruction in , the power of Vilya faded and it went over the sea along with Elrond at the end of the Third Age.

It is the fourth letter of the sixth grade or Tyellë, which contains "semi-vocalic" consonants and it is the sixth letter in the fourth series of consonants.  In early written Quenya this letter represented W when the letter was called Wilya.  Over time this letter ceased to have a clear function.  However, in the Mode of Beleriand (as seen in the Doors of Durin of Moria inscription) Vilya is used for a following W in the diphthong iw.  The Westron name for this letter is Á.See Westron Tengwar.
