The Blue Mountains (Sindarin Ered Luin), also known as the Ered Lindon, was the mountain range at the far west of Eriador.
== History ==
== Early history ==
In the early days of Arda after the fall of the Two Lamps, the Blue Mountains were formed as the Valar widened the Belegaer and thrust Middle-earth eastward to protect Valinor. The Blue Mountains lined up with the Grey Mountains (ancient), forming the western wall of Arda. These two ranges lay parallel to the Orocarni in the northeast and Yellow Mountains in the southeast that formed the eastern wall. At their northern end, a narrow gap separated the Blue Mountains from the Iron Mountains, which stretched across the entire north of Middle-earth.
Sometime during the Years of the Trees two Fathers of the Dwarves awoke under Dolmed and founded the two westernmost houses of the Dwarves (the Firebeards and Broadbeams).  They subsequently built two great city-states, Nogrod and Belegost.
In the First Age, the Blue Mountains were an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven rivers flowed from its western side, and the land these rivers flowed through was known as Ossiriand. Later, when the Green-elves settled there, the land was called Lindon, and the mountains sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.
The Blue Mountains were ruined during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, and in the south central end of the range the sea broke through. The Lhûn now flowed through the mountains to the Gulf of Lune. On the western side a small section of Lindon remained, and here the retreating Elves built the kingdom of Lindon, ruled by Gil-galad, last High King of the Noldor.
The Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost were also ruined when the mountains were broken, causing most of the Dwarves to migrate east to Moria, leaving a remnant behind. 
== Third Age ==
By the Third Age, Dwarves dwelt in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially in the parts south of the Gulf of Lhun where they have mines that are still in use. 
The Blue Mountains apparently saw the return of many of the Firebeards and Broadbeams due to the isolation/stagnation of Khazad Dûm, and the later awakening of Durins Bane.
In , fleeing the fall of Fornost Erain, Arvedui briefly hid in old dwarven mines in the Blue Mountains.
  
It also became the new home for many of Durins Folk who were exiled from their halls in Lonely Mountain by Smaug the Dragons who had Sack of Erebor.  After the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, King Thráin established his throne in the Southern range beyond the Shire and later his son Thorin ruled after he went missing. During Thorins reign, many of the wandering Longbeards joined him in Thorins Halls and they became prosperous in a fashion. However, Erebor was retaken from Smaug by Thorin and company in , and it can be assumed most if not all of Durins folk relocated there.
