 
The Battle of the Peak was Gandalf name for his climactic battle with the Balrogs known as Durins Bane, on the peak of the mountain called Celebdil.
Gandalf pursued the Balrog from the depths of Moria. On the peak they fought for two days and nights from 23 January to 25 January . During the battle, Durins Tower was destroyed and the entrance to the Endless Stair was blocked. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and it broke the mountain-side as it fell. Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.
