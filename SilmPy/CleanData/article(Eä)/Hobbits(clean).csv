Hobbits were between three to four feet tall, the average height being 3 feet 6 inches, with short legs, slightly pointed ears and furry feet with leathery soles, resulting in most never wearing shoes. Early in their recorded history, Hobbits were divided in three kinds with different customs and temperament. The Stoors grew facial hair and had an affinity for water, boats and swimming and wore boots; the Fallohides were fair, tall and slim, an adventurous people, friendlier and more open to outsiders. Finally, the Harfoots were the most numerous and instituted the living in burrows. In later days the Harfoot traits became the "norm".
Hobbits had a life span somewhat longer than Men of non-Númenórean descent, averaging between 90 and 100 years. The time at which a young hobbit "came of age" was 33. The two oldest-living recorded hobbits (except Gollum) were The Gerontius Took (who reached the age of 130) and Bilbo Baggins (who surpassed him at 131). 
Throughout their history Hobbits had showed unparelleled skill, courage and also endurance and resistance in times of danger and terror. During their Wandering Days Hobbits demostrated an easiness to adapt to the environments they visited and adopted the customs and languages of the peoples they were in contact with. In the Shire, they had settled with a closed and comfort-loving lifestyle; they were fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed, socializing and talking about genealogies. Hobbits also liked to drink ale in inns, and ate at least six meals a day when they could get them. Every Highday and after noon, Hobbits celebrated a small holiday with evening feasts. 
However, their hidden potentials resurfaced in difficult times; in the Long Winter, Gandalf admired their uncomplaining courage and pity one for another, thanks to which they survived. Another example of Hobbitish hardiness and resistant nature, was Gollum, who despite using the One Ring for years, did not transform into a Wraiths under the Rings evil power (unlike the Nazgûl).
 These surprising Hobbit traits also were tested and proven during the Quest of Erebor and, most notably, the War of the Ring.
==Origin==
File:Lidia Postma - Hobbits comparison.jpg
Hobbits were considered Men. Nearly all scholars agree that Men were closely related to Hobbits, far more closely than Men were to either Elves or Dwarves.  It was thus commonly assumed that Hobbits were among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar and were the result of the same act of creation as Men.  This would imply that Hobbits had the Gift of Men to pass entirely beyond Arda.
It is supposed that Hobbits branched out from Men as a race in the Elder Days. Their exact origin is unknown and they come into the records not earlier than the early Third Age where they were living in the Vales of Anduin in Rhovanion, between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains. They have lost the genealogical details of how they are related to the rest of mankind. While they stayed there, the Northmen knew them. Their descendants, the Rohirrim, had that memory of the holbytlan and they remained an object of lore until they contacted them during the War of the Ring. Many old words and names in "Hobbitish" are cognates of words in Rohirric, so much so that even someone without linguistic training could make out the relation (Meriadoc Brandybuck would later write an entire book devoted to the relationship, Old Place Names in the Shire).
==History==
File:Robin Wood - Mathom lore.jpg lore
While situated in the Valley of the Anduin River the Hobbits lived close by the Northmen. Some time near the beginning of the Third Age, they undertook, for reasons unknown, but possibly having to do with the Dol Guldur, the arduous task of crossing the Misty Mountains, beginning thus their Wandering Days.  Some of the Stoors, however, stayed behind, and it is from these people that Gollum would come many years later.  The Hobbits took different routes in their journey westward, but eventually came to a land between the River Baranduin (which they renamed Brandywine) and the Weather Hills.  There they founded many settlements, and the divisions between the Hobbit-kinds began to blur.
In the year , two Fallohide brothers decided to cross the River Brandywine and settle on the other side.  Large numbers of Hobbits followed them, and most of their former territory was depopulated.  Only Bree and a few surrounding villages lasted to the end of the Third Age.  The new land that they found on the west bank of the Brandywine is called The Shire.
Originally the Shire-hobbits swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arnor, being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair.  During the final fight against Angmar at the Battle of Fornost, the Hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded.  After the battle the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in absence of the king the Hobbits elected a Thain of the Shire from among their own chieftains.
The first Thain of the Shire was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the Oldbuck family.  However, later on the Oldbuck family crossed the Brandywine River to create the separate land of Buckland and the family name changed to the familiar "Brandybuck".  Their patriarch then became Master of Buckland.  With the departure of the Oldbucks/Brandybucks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thain, the Took family (Indeed, Peregrin Took was son of the Thain and would later become Thain himself).  The Thain was in charge of Shire-moot and Muster and the Hobbitry-in-arms, but as the Hobbits of the Shire led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives the office of Thain was seen as something more of a formality.

Though in The Hobbit it is mentioned that Gandalf "was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures," no female Hobbits are depicted in J.R.R. Tolkiens stories doing so; however Hobbit women do appear in his works, such as the formidable Lobelia Sackville-Baggins and Sams wife Rose Cotton.
== Etymology ==
:This section explains the fictional etymology of the word in the linguistic context of Middle-earth; for the actual origin of the word see the section #Inspiration below.
Hobbit was derived from Old English holbytla, "hole-dweller" which represents the Rohirric language., p. 144 In a letter, Tolkien commented on the pronounciation of the word hobbit: "I am sure many hobbits drop their hs like most rural folk in England".J.R.R. Tolkien, "Letter to Alina Dadlez (19 September 1962)" (letter); quoted in , p. 1036
The relationship hobbit/holbytla parallels the original Westron Kuduk (Hobbit), derived from the actual Rohirric kûd-dûkan (holbytla, hole dweller). This name obviously derives from the times when the hobbits lived at the Vales of Anduin with the Northmen.
Hobbits were also called Halflings by the Dúnedain, first when they still measured 2 rangar tall; twice as high as a hobbit who would reach only 1 ranga. The word retained even when the later generations of Dúnedain became shorter. However, the term is slightly offensive to Hobbits, as to themselves they are not half of anything, and certainly do not use the term to refer to themselves.
Halfling represents a translation of Westron banakil. In Quenya the word is perian pl. Periandi, dedication to Elaine Griffiths and in Sindarin Perian pl. Periannath.

==Inspiration==

Tolkiens etymology for Hobbit is interesting as well: the word obviously constructed meaningless as a spontaneous inspiration, without prior intent, but it would have been natural for him to see in it the German prefix hob meaning small (e.g. hobgoblin, hobbledehoy and hobyah). However this prefix dates back "only" to the 13th century, too late by Tolkiens standards; thence when later he began to work out the language relations further (see: Mannish) he decided that it could be a derived form of an Old English word such as holbytla.
According to Tolkien, the word hobbit came first, and then he decided to write The Hobbit around it. As a university lecturer, he was in the process of correcting reports when he started scribbling on a blank piece of paper and wrote, "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit", and the rest of the story sprang from that.Humphrey Carpenter, J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, p.172 The idea of a little hole dwelling creature was introduced to Tolkien by one of his students in a story he had written.
It was revealed recently that the word pre-dated Tolkiens usage, though with a different meaning). Tolkiens concept of hobbits, in turn, seems to have been inspired by Edward Wyke Smiths 1927 childrens book Wikipedia:The Marvellous Land of Snergs, and by Sinclair Lewiss 1922 novel Wikipedia:Babbitt (novel). Tolkien wrote to W.H. Auden that The Marvellous Land of Snergs "was probably an unconscious source-book for the Hobbits" and he told an interviewer that the word hobbit "might have been associated with Sinclair Lewiss Babbitt" who enjoys the comforts of his home.
The name hobbit had previously appeared in an obscure "Wikipedia:Denham Tracts" by Michael Denham, which includes several repetitions. There is no evidence to suggest Tolkien used this as a source &mdash; indeed he spent many years trying to find out whether he really did coin the word. Denhams "hobbit spirits" (which are never referenced anywhere except in the long list) have no obvious relation to Tolkiens Hobbits, other than the name (which may possibly imply hob- "small"): Tolkiens Hobbits are small humans, not spirits. Nonetheless, some few people have suggested that the reference in the Denham list should invalidate the trademark.
== In popular usage ==
"Hobbit" is a trademark owned by the Middle-earth Enterprises, as some of names, places and artifacts included in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. For this reason Dungeons and Dragons and other fantasy tend to refer to Hobbits and Hobbit-like races rather as Halflings (hin in the Mystara universe, hurthlings in Ancient Domains of Mystery).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis Homo floresiensis, a possible species in the genus Homo (thus, related to humans) discovered in 2004, has been informally dubbed a "hobbit" by its discoverers due to its small size.
Tolkien fandom have noted that in depictions and adaptations such as The Lord of the Rings (film series), Hobbits are shown with unusually large feet, a conception probably influenced by the widespread art of the Brothers Hildebrandt. However, Tolkien himself never mentioned that large feet was a general feature of Hobbits.
