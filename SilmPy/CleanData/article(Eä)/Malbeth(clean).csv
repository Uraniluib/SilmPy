Malbeth was a seer and royal counsellor gifted with foresight who is remembered in lore for two prophecies concerning the fate of the descendants of Isildur. 
==History==
Malbeth was probably a Dúnedain of the North who appears to have been a royal counsellor., entry "Malbeth"Malbeths Númenorean ancestry is also evidenced in the length of time between the dates of the seers known prophecies (1864 and 1975); at the time of the second prophecy, Malbeth must had been well over 100 years old. 
===Last King of Arthedain===
In  when the son of Araphant (fourteenth Kings of Arnor of Arthedain) was born, Malbeth advised Araphant to name his son Arvedui meaning "last king",
In  Arvedui was forced north by the forces of Angmar to the Ice Bay of Forochel to seek the help of the Lossoth. Círdan, hearing of Arveduis plight from Arveduis son Aranarth sent a ship to rescue him in the spring of that year. The Snowmen advised the king not to board the ship as they could smell danger in the air, they suggested that the king should wait until the summer when the Witch-kings power isnt so strong. Arvedui did not heed the advise and he perished when the ship broke upon some ice in a severe storm; thus, Malbeths prophecy was fulfilled.
===Paths of the Dead===
Malbeths second prophecy was in the days of the Arvedui (ruled  - ), the last king of Arthedain, in which the seer foretold Aragorns passage through the Paths of the Dead even though the event was over a thousand years in the future:
==Legacy==
Malbeths second prophecy was also fulfilled in  during the War of the Ring when Aragorn (sixteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain) learned from the palantíri that Gondor was being threatened from the south by a fleet of Corsairs from Umbar. He needed a route to get to them in haste, and Elronds message ("Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the Paths of the Dead") told him how.
Aragorn (with Legolas, Gimli and the Grey Company) travelled through the Paths of the Dead to the Stone of Erech where Aragorn blew a horm to summon the Oathbreakers. He told them he was Isildurs heir and so they fulfilled their oath and defeated the Corsairs which helped Gondor win the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
==Etymology==
Malbeths name is Sindarin for "Golden Word" from mal meaning "gold", and peth (becoming lenited to beth) meaning "word, voice".
