Ruby Baggins, n√©e Bolger, was a Hobbits of the Shire.
==History==
The daughter of Adalgar Bolger, Ruby married Fosco Baggins. They had three children: Dora Baggins, Drogo Baggins and Dudo Baggins. 
==Etymology==
Perhaps its not unintentional that a Hobbit woman with a jewel-name married into the Baggins family, recently made rich by Bilbos travels. Both Rubys marriage and name are consistent with the Bolgers being of a higher class., p.198
The name of the ruby derives from Latin http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rubeus rubeus meaning "red".http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ruby#Etymology_1 Wiktionary entry
