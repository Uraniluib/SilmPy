She died in , eight years after her husband. 
==Etymology==
wikipedia:Atropa belladonna is the name of a poisonous plant,J.R.R. Tolkien, Douglas A. Anderson, The Annotated Hobbit, "An Unexpected Party", note 8 fitting in with the Hobbit-habit of naming girls after flowers.
The word is understood as an Italian name, a rarity among Hobbits, and translates as "beautiful lady" although it derives from Latin bladone "nightshade".
The name participates in a circular wordplay with the names of her sisters, Mirabella Took and Donnamira Took, also Italian names.
==Inspiration==
In her first appearance in the fiction, Belladonna - which has stayed unchanged from the earliest survived sketch of the story, "The Bladorthin Typescript" -  is described as "one of three remarkable daughters of the Old Took". Humphrey Carpenter, in his attempt to draw an analogy between Bilbo and Tolkien, noted that Tolkiens mother, Mabel Suffield, was one of three remarkable daughters of John Suffield, who lived to be nearly a hundred.Humphrey Carpenter, J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography, "Enter Mr. Baggins", page 175
