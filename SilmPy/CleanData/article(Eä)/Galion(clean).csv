__NOTOC__
Galion was a Silvan Elves who served as butler in Thranduils halls in northeastern Mirkwood.
==History==
Galion served King Thranduil (and presumably also Thranduils son Legolas). One evening in  Galion and the captain of the guards decided to taste some new wine that had recently arrived to "see if it is fit for the kings table".  The heady vintage from Dorwinion soon put the two Elves asleep, which gave Bilbo Baggins his chance to free Thorin and Thorin and Company (who had been imprisoned in Thranduils dungeons during the Quest of Erebor).  Using the captains keys and his The One Ring, Bilbo freed the Dwarves and secreted them into several empty barrels.  When other Elves arrived to push the barrels in they found Galion and woke him up.  When the workers noted the heaviness of some of the "empty" barrels, Galion growled at them and ordered them to push the barrels into the water.
==Etymology==
The name Galion is said to be not Sindarin, although perhaps "Sindarized in shape"., p. 54For a name given the same description, cf. Lake-town#Etymology.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1968: The Hobbit (1968 radio series):
:Peter Baldwin provided the voice of Galion.
1982: The Hobbit (1982 video game):
: The game features an NPC simply known as "Butler" that appears in the Elvenkings halls, where he empties wine barrels to send back down the river, but he will throw the party members in the dungeons if he spots them. It is also possible for him to be killed, either by the player or one of their companions.
2003: The Hobbit (2003 video game):
:This video game depicts only Galion, and not the Captain of the Guard. The butler does not succumb to drunkenness, but because Bilbo puts three herbs - Moonleaf, Willowweed and Spiders Bane - in his mug. This change was possibly made to ensure a more favourable wikipedia:Video game content rating system.
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Galion is portrayed by Craig Hall. He is briefly seen by Bilbo Baggins (while hes wearing the One Ring) in the cellars of the Elvenkings Halls praising the selections of wine.
