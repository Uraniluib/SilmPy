Eastfold was a part of the realm of Rohan. Laying between the White Mountains and Entwash, it was bounded by the Mering Stream at the east and Snowbourn River at the west.
The whole area was traversed by the Great West Road parallel to the Mountain range. Locations of the Eastfold included the Folde to the west, with the capital city of Edoras nearby, and the Fenmark, being the south-eastern borders of Rohan. To the east laid Anórien of Gondor.
A similar name, the East Dales, are mentioned when it is told how the Rohirrim who had fallen in the Battle of the Hornburg were buried in two mounds; "those of the Westfold in one and those from the East Dales in another." It has been suggested that the name is obviously a synonym for Eastfold., pg. 419
