Cold-drakes were dragons that could not breathe fire. Morgoth bred and used cold-drakes in First Age. After the War of Wrath, some cold-drakes were found in the Northern Waste north of the the Grey Mountains.
As the millennia passed, their numbers grew, until they became a serious threat in the later centuries of the Third Age to the Dwarves that mined the Grey Mountains. In , Dáin I, Kings of Durins Folk, and his second son Frór were slain at the gates of their Dáins halls by a Cold-drake. The attacks of these fearsome creatures persuaded the Dwarves to migrate eastwards from the Grey Mountains, and it was soon afterward that their Dwarf realms in the Iron Hills and at Lonely Mountain were established.
