The East-West Road, Great East Road or Great Road, was the long road that ran east to west through Eriador, and crossed the Greenway at Bree. More commonly called simply the East Road.
==History==
The Great East Road was originally laid by the Dwarves probably during the First Age, and ran from the Iron Hills through  Rhovanion to Moria, from which it continued across Eriador to the Blue Mountains, and then on into Kingdom of Doriath in Beleriand. 
 
The western parts were built to facilitate the passage of companies of Dwarf craftsmen (and later, their armed escort) across eastern Beleriand, before the Battle of the Thousand Caves by the dwarves of Nogrod ended their trade.
After the ruination of Nogrod and neighbouring Belegost, focus shifted to the eastern part of the ancient road, which had been built by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in the Misty Mountains. Khazad-dûms inhabitants, the Durins Folk Dwarves, continued to grow in power and influence, and their trading needs meant that the road from the Iron Hills that travelled through Mirkwood to their gates, known as the Old Forest Road, became widely known. On the western side of the Misty Mountains, after traversing the High Pass, the road continued to the Blue Mountains, and this part ultimately became known as the Great East Road in later days.
 
When the Númenóreans realm-in-exile of Arnor was founded, the Dúnedain of Arnor took over the maintenance of the Great East Road, and built several fortresses on or near it (including Weathertop), and expanded or created bridges over the rivers Baranduin (Brandywine Bridge) and Hoarwell (Last Bridge). After Arnor was divided in , the Great East Road formed the boundary between two of its successor states, Cardolan and Rhudaur. During the Angmar Wars, Arthedain and Cardolan tried to mantain a frontier along the Weather Hils, the East Road, and the lower Hoarwell against Angmar and Rhudaur.
By the late Third Age the most notable users of the road were the Dwarves who traveled to and from the mines of the Blue Mountains. Those often stopped at Bree, and when they traversed the Shire they brought scarce news from the outside world; actually being the main link with the wide world for the Shire-hobbits.
==Course==
The western end of the Road was the Grey Havens, and that portion gave access to the Blue Mountains.
West of the crossroads the Hobbits had colonized the Shire, and their most important towns lay athwart the East Road; (Hobbiton and Michel Delving to name two).
Where the Great East Road met the Greenway lay the ancient village of Bree. A days ride east lay The Forsaken Inn, beyond which lay Rivendell. 
==Other versions==
Originally, the Road made two great curves: a great loop south of Weathertop to the North-east and then made a great bend southwards, round the feet of the Trollshaws; the text of the First Edition reflects this by saying "the Road bent back again southward towards the River". Because of Christopher Tolkiens "carelessness" in the 1954 General Map of Middle-earth, the Road has only a small northward curve between Weathertop and the Last Bridge, and then runs in a straight line to the Ford of Bruinen. In the Second Edition onwards, in order to agree with the map, the portion of the text was corrected to "the Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen".
The relevant map in Barbara Stracheys atlas Journeys of Frodo reflects the earlier descriptions.
