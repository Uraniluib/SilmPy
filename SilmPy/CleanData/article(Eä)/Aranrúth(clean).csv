Aranrúth was the sword of the Elves King Thingol of Doriath in the First Age.  Thingol apparently prized his weapon; when Beleg asked Thingol for a sword of worth for his quest to seek Túrin, the King said he could have his choice of any except his own., p. 96  After his death the sword was passed on to his descendants and Elwing rescued it from the Second Kinslaying. 
Elros, the first King of Númenor received it from his mother, and from there on it became an heirloom of the Kings of Númenor. It was lost in the Downfall of Númenor., Note 2
