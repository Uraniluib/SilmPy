The Guards of the Citadel or Tower of Gondor were those honoured guards of Minas Tirith who were charged with protecting the Citadel of Gondor, the highest and most important tier of the city, and participated in official functions.  When on duty they were not permitted to leave their post for any cause, save at the command of their lord.
They also guarded the White Tree of Gondor that stood in the Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith). At the time of the War of the Ring it had been dead for nearly 150 years,, 2872 until the new King Aragorn and Gandalf found a new seedling of the Tree, and the Guards great duty was refounded.
==Appearance and Attire==
At the end of the Third Age, they were the only soldiers of Gondor entitled to wear the Livery of Elendil Elendil - a white tree in blossom, surmounted by a silver crown and stars, all embroidered on a field of black. They also bore heirlooms of Gondors ancient wealth, tall helmets wrought out of mithril, with close-fitting cheek-guards and bearing the carved wings of sea-birds. On 10 March  Peregrin Took was arrayed as a Guard of the Citadel, at the command of the Stewards of Gondor Denethor.  His appearance in this uniform gave strength to the rumour that he was indeed Ernil i Pheriannath, the Prince of the Halflings.
==Organisation==
There were at least three companies, each of which had its own storehouse; Beregond, son of Baranor (man of Gondor) belonged to the Third Company. The Captain-general of the Guards was probably the heir of the throne; during the time of the Ruling Steward it was the heir of the Steward.
