Dol Baran was a hill in the land of Rohan, the last southern outpost of the northern range of the Misty Mountains. It was rounded and covered with heather.  After the visit to Isengard the party accompanying King Théoden camped in a dale on its southern side.  It was here that Peregrin Took looked into the Palantír of Orthanc and later that a Nazgûl flew over on its way to see Saruman.
==Etymology==
The name means "Shaven hill" (dol + paran) referring to its lack of trees.Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 433
