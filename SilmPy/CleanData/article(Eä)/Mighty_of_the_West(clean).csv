Mighty of the West was a title used once, in the quotation given above, to refer to Tuor the son of Huor. Its exact meaning is ambiguous: it appears in a passage that discusses Tuors relationship with his descendants, the Númenóreans, and so we have treated it here as an epithet for that division of Mankind.
It might conceivably, though, refer to the Valar, though it seems unlikely that such a comparison would be made of a mortal Man.
