Bruinen or Loudwater was a river in eastern Eriador.  It began with two tributaries flowing from the western slopes of the Misty Mountains, one of which came from the High Pass where Goblin-town existed.  The Bruinen terminated when it joined the Mitheithel River.  The southern arm of the Bruinen flowed through the deep valley where Elrond founded the refuge of Rivendell. The Bruinen had only one known ford, the Ford of Bruinen near Rivendell.
The river formed the eastern border of the Kingdom of Arnor and later the petty-realm of Rhudaur.  It also formed the northern border of Eregion.
==History==
When Thorin and company went to reclaim Lonely Mountain, they crossed the Bruinen after their adventure with the Trolls, before they long paused at Rivendell.
At the beginning of the War of the Ring Frodo Baggins was carried on Glorfindels horse towards the Ford of Bruinen, with the Nazgûl in hot pursuit. At the Ford Frodo, poisoned by a deadly wound, made his stand, and defied the Witch-king. This lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen, and Elrond and Gandalf released a great flood, which took the form of horses made out of water due to Gandalfs magic. This flood killed the horses of the Ringwraiths and their physical forms, buying the Fellowship of the Ring some time.
==Etymology==
Like most rivers in Eriador, the Bruinen had a Westron name, which Tolkien translated as Loudwater. Patrick H. Wynne linked the first element brui "noisy" to the second element of the word Ulumúri, and several other Qenya and Gnomish words with some connection to "great sound". The second element is nen, "water".http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lambengolmor/message/895 Editorial to Lambengolmor message 895
