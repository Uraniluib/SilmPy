The Gladden Fields (Sindarin Loeg Ningloron) was, at the end of the Third Age, a large marsh on the west side of the Anduin that extended along either side of its tributary, the Gladden River (Sîr Ninglor), south of the Carrock.  
In ancient times a lake had formed at their meeting-place, but by the beginning of the Third Age the lake had been replaced by a wilderness of marshes and islets filled with reeds, rushes, and vast clumps of yellow irises grown taller than a man that grew there in hosts., note 13
==History==
In the First Age when the Silvan Elves first entered the Vales of Anduin, they found a lake in the deep depression where the Anduin and Gladden met.  Although wider to the west, the lake probably did reach the sloping edge of Mirkwood .  After many years the lake filled with sediment and became a marsh.
In  near this place, on a slope east of the Anduin, Isildur and his three oldest sons were ambushed by Orcs when they marched back towards Arnor.  Isildurs sons were killed in that battle, while he attempted to escape using the power of invisibility of the One Ring.  He ran to the Anduin and tried to cross it.  Due to the current he was swept downstream until he reached the western bank near the inflow of the river Gladden.  But the Ring had slipped from Isildurs finger and when he stood up he was seen by Orcs, who laid there to kill any survivors of the ambush, and was slain by their arrows.
During the reign of King Calimehtar (King of Gondor) of Gondor (who died in ) the Éothéod were a small people living in the Vale of Anduin; their southern boundary was the Gladden Fields., (i) The Northmen and the Wainriders
During the height of Angmar, after , some Stoors from the Angle (Eriador) passed again the Mountains and probably about 1410 p. 164 a band resettled in the Gladden Fields and formed a matriarchic society. It was here, about , that the Hobbits Déagol retrieved the One Ring from the Gladden and he was killed by his cousin Sméagol, who became the evil creature called Gollum.
Borondir, the messenger of Gondor sent by the Steward Cirion in  to seek aid from the Éothéod (who by then had migrated farther up the Anduin valley), was pursued as he rode north as far as the Gladden Fields., (ii) The Ride of Eorl
In , after a meeting of the White Council, Saruman began searching near the Gladden Fields for the One Ring.  He became alarmed to discover that Saurons servants were also searching the region.
==Etymology==
From Old English glaedene, "gladden" is another name for the "flag" or "wikipedia:Iris (plant)"., p. 771 Tolkien identified the "gladden" as the yellow species wikipedia:iris pseudacorus growing in streams and marshes, and not the species now usually spelt wikipedia:gladdon.
Tolkien suggested to translators to avoid if possible the learned name iris.
