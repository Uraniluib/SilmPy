==Notes==
According to astronomy, the moon on that day of 3019, would have be a waning gibbous, which rises after midnight (and thus early on 14 January) until it passes over the Misty Mountains and shine on the western side where the Gate was. 
So the Appendix B must be incorrect when it has the Company enter Moria before midnight on the 13th.http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html
