Obel Halad was the "capital" of Brethil, the homeland of the People of Haleth.  Within this settlement was the hall of the Halad or Warden of Brethil, who was the leader of the land., p. 263  Obel Halad meant the Fortified Settlement of the Halad.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the development of the story, "The Wanderings of HÃºrin" (a tale that Christopher Tolkien regretfully excluded from The Silmarillion), Obel Halad replaced Ephel Brandir as the chief settlement of the Haladin., note 17, p. 301  Since Ephel Brandir was built upon Amon Obel it is likely that its replacement was also intended to be in the same location.
