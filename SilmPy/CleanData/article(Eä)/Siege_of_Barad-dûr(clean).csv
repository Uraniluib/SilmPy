The Siege of Barad-dûr was the armed conflict that would end the War of the Last Alliance and the Second Age. It was the direct result of the Battle of Dagorlad, where passage into Mordor was won by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at heavy cost. 
== History ==
===The Siege===
In  the Last Alliance entered Mordor. The Orcs that survived the slaughter at Dagorlad were surrounded in Barad-dûr, Saurons dark stronghold. There, the forces of Gil-galad, Elendil and Thranduil laid siege to the tower, but could not breach its gates. 
Sauron put together a strong defence with a seemingly unexhaustible supply of projectile and sorties throughout seven years, during which the Allies suffered heavy casualties. In , Anárions helmet was crushed by a thrown rock resulting in his death.
Second Age 3441, however, Sauron went out with a sortie himself, and broke the leaguer. He came to Mount Doom, where the two kings, Gil-galad and Elendil, fought with him in single combat. Sauron struck down Elendil, and his sword Narsil broke in two beneath him as he fell. Gil-galads face was scorched by the heat of Saurons hand, killing him. Nonetheless Sauron was wounded in the fight with the two kings, and as he let his guard down, Isildur took up the broken hilt of his fathers blade and hewed off Saurons ring finger, defeating him.
=== Aftermath ===
The battle marked the (temporary) passing of Sauron, and the beginning of the Third Age. Gil-galads heralds Círdan and Elrond advised Isildur to destroy the Ring by throwing it in the fires of Mount Doom. But instead Isildur replied: This I will have as weregild for my fathers death, and my brothers. Was it not I who dealt the Enemy his death-blow?
Gondor prospered, and built fortresses on all the entrances to Mordor: the Morannon, Durthang and the Tower of Cirith Ungol. Isildur wrote an account of the battle, describing his father and Gil-galads duel with Sauron in detail and the lengthy siege itself.
With the death of Gil-galad, the Noldor were without a King as he left no heir. Elrond and Círdan returned to Lindon. Relations between Elves and Men worsened due to the deaths of Gil-galad and Elendil, and also Isildurs taking of the ring. The Last Alliance as it came to be known, would be the last time Elves would go to open war in Middle-earth ever again. The relationship between Men and Elves wouldnt be as close as they were in the first and second ages and never wholly repaired because the Elves were leaving Middle-earth for Aman.
Isildur remained in Minas Tirith some time. When he did return North, he and his sons were Disaster of the Gladden Fields. The Ring was lost in the tumult. 
Since the Ring was not unmade, Sauron was not completely destroyed: his spirit was able to live on. In the Third Age, he reassumed physical shape, and regained most of his old realm and allies. Ever after Sauron hunted for the Ring, dispatching his servants across Middle-earth to locate it. The Ring would come to be known as Isildurs Bane, as its corruption afflicted him.
