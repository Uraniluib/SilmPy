Elephants were creatures only mentioned fleetingly. Gandalf does mention them, so it is possible that they shared the wide burning plains of the Harad with what would be their giant relatives, the Oliphaunts.
In Quenya, the word for "elephant" is andamunda. The Noldorin cognate of the same meaning is andabon or annabon., p. 372 (root MBUD)
