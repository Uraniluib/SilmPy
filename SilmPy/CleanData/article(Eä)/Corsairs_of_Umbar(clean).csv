The Corsairs of Umbar were sea-raiders and pirates of the Umbar. Umbar was an old Númenóreans haven settled by the "Kings Men" or Black Númenóreans, a proud faction loyal to the King and opposed to the divine authority of the Valar. 
==History==
After the Downfall of Númenor, the Umbar settlers further descended into evil, and were called the Black Númenóreans. They took to pillaging and piracy along the coasts of Gondor. 
During the Kin-strife, the defeated rebels of Castamir fled Gondor to Umbar — by this time Umbar became the hated enemy of Gondor and a welcome refuge for its enemies. Ever since they claimed Harondor.
Angamaite and Sangahyando, the descendants of Castamir, led the Corsairs again Pelargir where stayed King Minardil and slew him (). In the following years the Corsairs raided the Gondorian coasts up to Anfalas, until Umbardacil avenged Minardils death, retook Umbar and slew the last descendants of Castamir (). 
Eventually Umbar was taken by the Haradrim and mixed with the Corsairs. The Númenórean blood was mostly gone in that mixed people. The Corsairs once more harried the coasts of Gondor during the time of Cirion. 
In  three Corsair fleets attacked and waged war on all the Gondorian coasts until Beregond (Steward of Gondor) overcame the invaders. 
In the time of Ecthelion II, a man under his service known as Thorongil, warned him that the Corsairs were a great peril for the Southern Fiefs. With a small fleet, Thorongil made a Surprise Attack on Umbar, burning a great part of their ships and overthrowing the Captain of the Haven.
During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, a fleet of Corsairs was raiding Lebennin when Aragorn captured their ships and rowed them to Minas Tirith to relieve the siege of the city.
The threat was finally subdued during the reign of King Elessar.
==Culture==
The corsairs were recognizable by their red sails, adorned with a black star or eye.
