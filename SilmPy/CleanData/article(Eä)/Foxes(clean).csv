Foxes were dogs-like carnivores of woodland and farmland, distinctive for their red-orange coats and their eerie plaintive cries. A fox became puzzled at finding Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took asleep in a Firs on the first night of their journey from Hobbiton. Another fox was encountered by Aragorn and the hobbits as they hiked through the Chetwood after leaving Bree.
The Quenya word for "fox" is rusco (Sindarin has rusc)., p. 353, p. 10
