__NOTOC__
The Carrock was a stony eyot in the upper reaches of the River Anduin, to the north of the Old Ford.  The river looped around the rock although there was a Ford of Carrock of stones to the eastern bank.  At the base was a little cave with adjacent steps that led to a flat space upon the top.
==History==
The stairs had been built by Beorn who sometimes would be seen climbing to the top in the form of a Bears to look at the Moon or the Misty Mountains.
In , Thorin and Company were placed on the summit by the Eagles. They bathed and rested at the cave.
According to Bilbo Baggins account of his journey, Radagasts home, Rhosgobel, was near the Carrock.
==Etymology==
Like Chetwood#Etymology, the name Carrock appears to be a compound of two words of the same meaning: Old English http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carr#Old_English carr, Welsh Wiktionary:carreg "rock, stone" + English rock., p. 207
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with a number of names before he settled upon the Carrock â€” he first considered Sorneldin, then Sinrock, then Lamrock before making his final choice., note 12, p. 246
==Portrayal in Adaptions==
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: 
:After the Eagles take Thorin and Company to the Carrock, Thorin and Bilbo reconcile after Thorins heavy resentment against Bilbo. Contrary to the books, Erebor is clearly visible from the rock.
