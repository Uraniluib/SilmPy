Feren was an Elves of the Woodland Realm who appears in the The Hobbit (film series). He was played by Simon London. When it is discovered that Thorin and Company have escaped from their prison cells via wine barrels, Feren blows a horn to alert the Elves guarding the gate that leads to the River Running, also ordering them to close the gate so as to bring the Dwarves back into custody.
Later, Feren is sent by Thranduil to where the Lake-town refugees are staying to summon Legolas back to Mirkwood, and to also inform Tauriel that the elven-king has banished her from the realm. He also serves as one of Thranduils chief lieutenants in the Battle of Five Armies.
