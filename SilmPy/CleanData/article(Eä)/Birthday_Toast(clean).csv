The Birthday Toast was an event held each year at a small gathering in honour of both Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins birthdays, held each year on the 22nd of September at Bag End (both hobbits shared the same birthday).
This custom began after Bilbo left Bag End after the celebration of his 111th birthday.
==Tolkien Society tradition==
The Tolkien Society has upheld this tradition through a Birthday Toast in honour of the creator of Bilbo and Frodo - J.R.R. Tolkien and is held on the authors birthday, 3rd January, each year. The toast itself is: "The Professor".
