Ancalagon the Black (Sindarin, pron. ) was the greatest of the winged Dragons of Morgoth.
==History==
During the War of Wrath, the Valar waged their final war on Morgoth. Their victory was at hand, with most of the Dark Lords Balrogs and other troops destroyed. But then, Morgoth unleashed the winged dragons, with Ancalagon at their Wikipedia:Vanguard. Ancalagon drove back the forces of the Valar, but was stopped by Eärendil. Ancalagon was no match for the mariner, who sailed through the skies in the ship Vingilot, with the Silmaril upon his brow. Ancalagon was cast down and fell atop Thangorodrim, breaking its mighty towers. With him fell most other dragons., "Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath" Even by the late Third Age Ancalagon was considered the mightiest winged dragon, though Gandalf noted that that dragon could not melt the One Ring., "The Shadow of the Past"
