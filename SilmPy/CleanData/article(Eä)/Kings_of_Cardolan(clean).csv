The Kings of Cardolan were the hereditary rulers of Cardolan, a splinter kingdom of Arnor.
The first king of Cardolan was the second son of EÃ¤rendur (King of Arnor) who following his fathers death in  disputed the ascension of his elder brother Amlaith to the throne and declared himself king of the independent realm of Cardolan. The exact sequence of events which led to this, the later deeds of the kings of Cardolan as well as their names remain unknown.
Presumably the last king of Cardolan died in  &mdash; the year given for its destruction by Angmar &mdash; as what remained of his subjects were absorbed into the kingdom of Arthedain.
