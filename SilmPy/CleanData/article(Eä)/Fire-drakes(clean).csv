"…the fire-drakes of the North, issued from Angbands gates by night."
Fire-drakes (Quenya Urulókë) were fire breathing Dragons.
==History and Characteristics==
The fire-drakes were the more powerful of the two fundamental divisions of dragon-kind (the other being the cold-drakes), who, as the name suggests, were able to breathe fire. Glaurung, the Father of Dragons, was the first of the species. He first appeared in the middle of the First Age but the Urulóki were known to have survived even after the downfall of Morgoth. Other dragons considered to be of the fire-drakes during the Elder Days were Ancalagon and the terrible Beast of Gondolin.
Smaug, the last of the truly powerful dragons, was slain by Bard in the late Third Age., passim We can be sure that he was not the last of the fire-drakes, though, because Gandalf refers to fire-breathing dragons in the time before the War of the Ring, nearly eighty years after Smaugs death.
