The Gondolindrim were the people of Gondolin, a mixed population of Noldor and Sindar Elves under the rule of Turgon. While they take their name from the city of Gondolin where they later dwelt, the Gondolindrim were in origin the Elves of Nevrast. Ulmo seemed to take a special interest in the Gondolindrim throughout their history. The Gondolindrim were keen in arts and constructions but also valiant fighters.
==History==
The first Elves to dwell in Nevrast were Sindar, who had been drawn in days of old to the coasts near Mount Taras by the comings of Ulmo and Ossë. At the time the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, most of the Grey-elves of Nevrast still dwelt in the coastal region in the southwest. Turgon settled there with his own people, Noldor of the house of Fingolfin, taking up lordship of Nevrast and building Vinyamar. The first mingling of Sindar and Noldor took place in Nevrast, and they became one people.
At Ulmos urging and with his guidance Turgon, seeking a refuge from Morgoth, found the hidden vale of Tumladen within the Encircling Mountains. After Dagor Aglareb Turgon brought many of the most skilled of the Elves of Nevrast to Tumladen, where they set about building Gondolin in secret. When the city was finished, the people of Nevrast (including one third of the Noldor of Fingolfin, and even more Sindar) abandoned Nevrast and came in secret, in small companies one-by-one, through Ered Wethrin to Gondolin.
Because Gondolin was strictly separated from the rest of Beleriand by Ered Wethrin and it is unlikely that substantial numbers of other kindreds ever came to settle there. Only a few notable outsiders are known to have reached the hidden city: Huor and Húrin Thalion were the first Men to come to Gondolin and dwelt there for a year,. Tuor, son of Huor, made the city his home and Maeglin, son of Eöl and Turgons sister Aredhel, fled there with his mother from Nan Elmoth..
At the Fall of Gondolin, the survivors led by Tuor went to the Mouths of Sirion.
==Etymology==
Gondolindrim is a standard formation of Gondolin (Sindarin: The Hidden Rock) and the Sindarin suffix rim, denoting a people..
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Gondothlim was an earlier term for the inhabitants of Gondolin.
==Houses of the Gondolindrim==
In the The Fall of Gondolin (chapter) the Gondolindrim are described as being organised into a number of Houses. At the time of the citys fall there were twelve of these, each with a named symbol and leader:
