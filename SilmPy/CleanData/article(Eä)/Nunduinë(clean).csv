Nunduinë was a river of Númenor, the second longest after the Siril. It flowed westward out of the central regions of the island, and as it approached the sea, its waters spread to form the fragrant lake of Nísinen. Its mouth was at the haven of Eldalondë, on the shores of the Bay of Eldanna.
==Etymology==
Patrick H. Wynne has suggested that Nunduinë is a Quenya name meaning "Western River", consisting of nún- ("western") + luine ("river")., p. 31
