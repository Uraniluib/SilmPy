Giants were one of the mysterious :Portal:Characters of Middle-earth, mentioned only fleetingly.
==History==
Giants are beings shrouded in mystery. Gandalf was known for telling stories about dragons and Orcs and giants and Bilbo Baggins had heard of giants in tales, but none of these tales survive and the origin and history of the giants is obscure., "(iii): The Giants", pp. 143-5
A local legend among the Pre-Númenóreans of Gondor told of giants making the White Mountains, to keep Men out of their lands by the Belegaer. One of them, Tarlang, tripped, and broke his neck. The other giants did not clean up his body, which became incorporated in the land instead. The giants neck became Tarlangs Neck, his head Dol Tarlang, and the stones he was carrying Cûl Veleg and Cûl Bîn., pp. 536-7
The Ettenmoors owed their name to some gigantic creatures of that land, although these were perhaps merely some kind of trolls., p. 183
The stone-giants lived in the Misty Mountains during the late Third Age. Upon coming, they drove out the majority of the bears that lived there. They found a sport in throwing rocks at each other, and then into the depths below them to hear them shatter among the trees.
Presumably, not all giants were evil, as Gandalf hoped to convince a more or less decent giant to block the Front Porch to Goblin-town at the top of the High Pass in the Misty Mountains.
==Fandom==
Giants are notable for being definitely mentioned in The Hobbit as actual creatures of the mythological setting, yet appearing nowhere else among the creatures and races of Arda, nor participating in any of the wars. The Valaquenta doesnt mention them, nor do they appear in the wars of the Quenta Silmarillion, neither does Sauron use them in the War of the Ring.
This led some Tolkienists to assume that giants are maybe a fleeting idea of Tolkien that perhaps should not be considered canonical. Robert Foster comments that the stone-giants "may be no more serious than Golfimbul"., p. 366
Other theories attempt to include the giants among the known races of Arda. For example they might be a large race of Men (like Hobbits are a small race of Men), or Trolls, or simply "nature Spirit (disambiguation)" more or less like Tom Bombadil. Furthermore, Douglas A. Andersons annotations in The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition express the opinion that stone-giants are a variety of troll., p. 104
==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Before The Hobbit===
Giants originally had a larger part in the legendarium. In one early manuscript, the giants are counted among the úvanimo, servants of Morgoth. In another manuscript, the giants are counted among the Earthlings, and are divided between the "wood-giants" (Qenya ulbandi) and "mountainous-giants" (Qenya taulir)., p. 9 And in other early writings, two giants are named: Nan (Giant) (said to be like an Elms-tree) and Gilim (whose name is Gnomish for "winter"). (verse 1497).
It is quite possible that their appearance in The Hobbit is a relic from this early phase of the legendarium. John D. Rateliff has argued that they might have become "free agents"; not wicked, but simply not aware of their surroundings.
===Other names and etymologies===
An early Sundocarmë for "giant" is given as NOROTH. This yields Quenya norsa, (cf. Sundocarmë NOROTH) and Noroth (likely supposed to be a Noldorin word). A discarded Quenya word was hanako, from a root KHAN-AK., p. 21

===Giants and Ents===
Giants were the wicked precursors of Ents. The elm-like features of the Giant Nan, and that in early versions of The Lord of the Rings it was the Giant Treebeard who held Gandalf captive, not Saruman, makes the connection between Giants and Ents within J.R.R. Tolkiens imagination clear. "Ent" comes from an Old English word for "giant", seen at various points in Beowulf (poem), for example line 2717, enta geweorc, "the work of giants".Howell D. Chickering, Jr., "Beowulf: A Dual Language Edition", pp. 212-3
==Inspiration==
In Germanic mythology names for the giants were jotun (Norse) and eoten (Old English). From the latter word Tolkien derived the name "Ent".
In the The Return of the King it is noted that Minas Tirith "seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth". Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull have suggested that this notion derives from Old English mythology, in which giants were often portrayed as builders of ancient structures., p. 514
