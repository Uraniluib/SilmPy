Alfrid Lickspittle was the civil servant of the Master of Lake-town. His character was invented by Peter Jackson for The Hobbit (film series), and played by Ryan Gage.
==History==
Alfrid serves as the Master of Lake-towns chief overseer, always alerting the Master of any potential plots against his power - much to the chagrin of some Lake-town residents. He and the Master particularly have Bard in their sights, knowing his relation to Girion, last Lord of Dale. When Smaug arrives to demolish the town, he and the Master - along with a few guards - empty out the towns treasury into a boat and attempt to retreat with it. However, when the overloaded boat started spilling treasure into the lake, the Master pushes Alfrid overboard in order to lessen the weight.
When the towns refugees gather on the shore of Long Lake in the aftermath of the destruction, Bard is immediately praised for slaying the Dragons and the citizens look to him for guidance - Alfrid immediately champions Bard despite the disapproval of several people. When the Battle of Five Armies begins, Alfrid spends most of his time attempting to hide from it, despite Bard ordering every able man to take up arms, and specifically telling Alfrid to join the fighting. Not long after finding a treasure trove in the ruins of Dale, Bard, after saving him from an attack by an Ogres, tells him to leave and not come back.
In the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition) of the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, after said encounter with Bard, Alfrid hides in a catapult, which he inadvertently sets off when one of the coins which he has collected drops on the release trigger. This launches him into the mouth of a Trolls, which kills them both.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)
