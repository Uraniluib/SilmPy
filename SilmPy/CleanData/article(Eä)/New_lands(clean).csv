New Lands were lands created by Ilúvatar when the world was remade after the downfall of Númenor.  Long after that cataclysm men from Middle-earth sailed west, seeking the summit of the Meneltarma, which they believed had risen above the waves and from which a person could still descry the Undying Lands.  However, the Isle of Meneltarma was never found.  Instead mariners only discovered new lands which were like the old lands in that they were subject to death.  These new lands did not form a barrier to travel; sailors found that they could circumnavigate the world and thus could report: "All roads are now bent".
