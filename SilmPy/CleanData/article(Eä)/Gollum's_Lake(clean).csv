Gollums Lake was a small subterranean body of icy cold water inside the Misty Mountains. The lake had a tiny island in the middle, which provided protection for Gollum from the nearby Goblin-town and was where he lived for over four hundred years during the Third Age (Gollum entered the Misty Mountains about  and departed in ; how long it took him to find the lake is unknown). The lake harboured fish, which was the main food source of Gollum.
