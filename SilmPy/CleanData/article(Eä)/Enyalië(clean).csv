Enyalië (pronounced  //) is an annual activity held as the concluding part of The Tolkien Societys Oxonmoot celebration.
On the Sunday morning of the Oxonmoot convention, attendees of the event take a coach trip to Wolvercote Cemetery where J.R.R. Tolkien and his wife Edith Tolkien are buried. Enyalië is a "sombre" wreath-laying ceremony which involves a "short act of remembrance" at Tolkiens graveside. The Chairman of the Society reads a passage from Tolkiens works whilst the song Namárië is sung by one of the Societys long-standing members.
Chairman of The Tolkien Society, Shaun Gunner, described the event as "poignant and touching" whilst noting that "many regard it as the single most important activity of Oxonmoot".
