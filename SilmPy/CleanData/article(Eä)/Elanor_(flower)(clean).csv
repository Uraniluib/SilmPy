Elanor was a golden, star-shaped flower that grew in abundance in the forest of Lothlórien. Samwise Gamgee thought highly of the flower and, at Frodo Baggins suggestion, named his eldest daughter, Elanor Gardner, from it.
It was like "a pimpernel (perhaps a little enlarged) growing sun-golden flowers and star-silver ones on the same plant, and sometimes the two combined".
==Etymology==
The word elanor means "Sun-star" in Sindarin (from êl = "star" and anor = "Sun").
