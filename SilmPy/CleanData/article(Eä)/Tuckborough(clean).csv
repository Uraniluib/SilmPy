Tuckborough was an old and important settlement in the Westfarthing of the Shire, nestled in the Green Hill Country. A road connected Tuckborough with the Yale and Stock (with the Causeway) to the east. It was the location of Great Smials, the ancestral seat of the Took Family, the hereditary Thains of the Shire.
