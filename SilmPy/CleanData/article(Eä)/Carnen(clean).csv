Carnen &mdash; Sindarin for Redwater &mdash; was a :Category:Rivers that flowed generally southward from the Iron Hills east of the Lonely Mountain until it met the River Running about 250 Númenóreans miles to the south.  Its course lay in the boundary region between "The North" (the northwestern region of Middle-earth) and the vast "East" (the area called Rhûn).
Between the time when Thráin I founded the dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain (in ) and the arrival of Smaug (in ) the Northmen living between the Celduin and Carnen grew strong and repelled all eastern enemies.  This area became depopulated after the arrival of the dragon but again filled with Northmen after Smaugs demise.  During the War of the Ring the northern host of Sauron crossed the Carnen and drove the forces of King Brand back to Dale.
