Salmar (Quenya, pron. ) was a Maia serving Ulmo. He made the Ulumúri for his master, the great conches which produce the music of the sea.Salmar is mentioned only once in the narrative and his nature as a Maia is given in the Index, but it is unknown whether that entry was written by J.R.R. Tolkien or his son Christopher Tolkien.
== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium Salmar is often called by the title Noldorin, and sometimes Lirillo. He was mentioned to be the brother of Ómar.
==Etymology==
The Quenya name Salmar is derived from salma ("lyre, small harp"). Lirillo is a Qenya name meaning "Valu of the Song" (containing either glîr "a song, poem" or lir- "sing" + masculine ending -illo)., p. 13 (footnote 10)
