__NOTOC__File:Pamela Shanteau - Bats.jpg
Bats were flying creatures of the night that tended to roost in caves or dark forests.
In the First Age Thuringwethil was Saurons messenger and took the form of a giant bat with great fingered wings.  Lúthien would take her form when she and Beren journeyed to Thangorodrim.
Bats were apparently quite common in the northern parts of Middle-earth.  When Bilbo Baggins was walking alone in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains he heard the whirr of bats by his ears so often that it ceased to startle him.  As Bilbo and the dwarves marched through Mirkwood they gave up lighting fires at night because they attracted thousands of moths, followed by huge black bats.  Bilbo encountered yet another bat in Smaugs lair after the dragon had gone away.  This creature, brushing Bilbos face, caused the hobbit to stumble and his torch to go out (which brought the dwarves to his rescue with more torches).  Bats were most famous in Middle-earth for taking the part of the Orcs during the Battle of Five Armies, in which they flew together over the battlefield so densely that no light could be seen between their wings.
