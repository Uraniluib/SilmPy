Master of Buckland was a hereditary title among the Bucklanders Hobbits. As the head of the Brandybuck Family, he was also known as the Master of the Brandy Hall. Like the Thain and Warden of Westmarch, the Master had only nominal authority.
It was traditional for each of the Masters to have an epigraph attached to their names, such as Gorbadoc Brandybuck "Broadbelt", Saradoc Brandybuck "Scattergold", and the most famous, Meriadoc the Magnificent.
