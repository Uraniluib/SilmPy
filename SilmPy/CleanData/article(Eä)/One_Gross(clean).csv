One Gross is a measurement equal to 144 of something (a dozen dozens). 
One gross was the number of people invited to Bilbos Farewell Party in order to much the sum of his and Frodo Baggins
s ages (111 and 33).  However, when Bilbo Baggins called them thus, many were insulted as the term "gross" was not used properly on people.
