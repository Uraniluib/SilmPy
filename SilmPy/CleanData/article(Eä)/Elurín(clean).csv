Elurín ( – ) was a son of Dior and Nimloth of Doriath.  He had a twin brother named Eluréd and a sister Elwing, and all three had been born in Lanthir Lamath while Beren and Lúthien lived there.  However, after the host of the Naugrim had plundered Menegroth, Dior brought his family to the Thousand Caves to renew the kingdom of Doriath.
But soon, after not many years had passed, a messenger brought the Nauglamír to Dior, which told him that Beren and Lúthien were gone from the world.  The news that Necklace of the Dwarves, which bore one of the Silmarils, was in Diors keeping provoked the sons of Fëanor to attack Menegroth.  Dior and Nimloth were slain and Eluréd and Elurín were captured (Elwing escaped with the Silmaril).  The two young boys were taken into the woods by the servants of Celegorm and left to starve.  Maedhros repented and sought for the two but never found them.
