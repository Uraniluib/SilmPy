telpe, pp. 366-7 (or telpë (entry for celeb)), tyelpe, p. 426 (or tyelpë), tyelep-, and telep, are Quenya words for "silver".
==Etymology==
In a letter, J.R.R. Tolkien stated that the form tyelpe derives from Primitive Elvish kyelepē.
It appears like tyelpe is the most ancient (or "pure") Quenya word for silver; the  form telpe, which became the usual form among the Quenya-speaking Elves, was borrowed from (or influenced by) Telerin telepi (itself apparently a later form of the original Telerin form telepi)., p. 356 (note 4)
Christopher Tolkien has noted that tyelep-, tyelpe derive from Sundocarme KYELEP. In the The Etymologies, telpe, tyelpe derive from root KYELEP.
