Edhellond was an ancient harbour in southern Gondor. It had been established south-west of where the Ringló entered the Morthond, near where the combined waters flowed into Cobas Haven., West, p. 434
==History==
Edhellond was founded by Sindar before the end of the First Age, who had come there as refugees from Beleriand during Morgoths ascendancy. At first the population of the haven was quite small since the refugees had come in just three small ships, but over time their numbers had been increased by Nandor who came down the Anduin., p. 247
From Edhellond Elves began sailing westward from the time of the fall of Eregion (in ).
Amroth, Prince of Lórien, was lost at sea near Edhellond in  when he attempted to swim to shore to seek his beloved Nimrodel the Elf-maid. The ship from which he jumped overboard was the last ship of Elves to leave from Edhellond, which was deserted from then on,, pp. 241-242 although remembered in the traditions of Men in Gondor.
== Etymology ==
Edhellond means "Elf Haven" in Sindarin (from edhel = "Elf" edhel and lond = "harbour, haven" londë).
