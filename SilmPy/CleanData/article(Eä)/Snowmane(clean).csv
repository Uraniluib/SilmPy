Snowmane was the horses of Théoden, Kings of Rohan. His sire was Lightfoot and was probably one of the Mearas., p. 362
Théoden rode with him to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The steed was killed when struck with a black dart by the Witch-king, and he fell on the King, mortally wounding him.
Snowmane, also referred to as Théodens Bane and Masters Bane, was buried where he fell. On the site known as Snowmanes Howe a stone was erected the grass grew the most green ever after.
==Etymology==
Snowmane is the Modern English form of Old English (which represents Rohirric) snāw-mana. The proper Rohirric name was thus Snawmana., p. 763
