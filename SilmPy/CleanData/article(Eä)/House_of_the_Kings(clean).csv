The House of the Kings in the Hallows of Minas Tirith was the building wherein the kings of Gondor were buried.  
On 1 March  Aragorn laid down and died, after bidding farewell to Eldarion and giving unto him the Winged Crown of Gondor.  It is said that the beds of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took were set beside the bed of Aragorn in the House of the Kings.
