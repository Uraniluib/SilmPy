__NOTOC__
==History==
With the War of the Ring raging in the South-east, many refugees came up the Greenway to Bree. Not all these refugees came with the same intentions: a group of ruffians was ousted from the town near the end of . With the help of Bill Ferny and Harry Goatleaf, they returned soon after New Year, and a fight ensued. The number of casualties on the side of the ruffians was not recorded, but five of the Bree-folk, three Men and two Hobbits, were killed. Mat Heathertoes was one of them.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, "Homeward Bound" 
==Etymology==
Mat was a name employed by J.R.R. Tolkien to translate the common (but untranslated) Hobbit name Matta.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F, "II: On Translation" The name Heathertoes was, like all surnames of the Men of Bree, a plant name,J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, "At the Sign of the Prancing Pony" though this seems to have escaped Tolkien when he wrote Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings. In it he said Heathertoes was a Hobbit name, and was given in joke to the unshod Hobbits. While walking, they would gather twigs and moss between their toes., page 759 However, Mat was most certainly a Man: given that two of the five were Hobbits, and the last two named victims - Willie Banks and an Underhill Family were both positively identified as Hobbits as well.
