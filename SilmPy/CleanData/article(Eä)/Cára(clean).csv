__NOTOC__
cára also cas p. 17 (pl. cari p.68) means "head" in Quenya.
==Etymology==
The word derives from earlier cáza p.188 .
The short form retained the s being final, but again, it evolved into r when inflected.
==See also==
*cassa "helmet"
==Other versions==
The Etymologies show a reverted case: the nominative is cár and the inflected form casi. It represents a very early phonological scenario of the language, as seen in the Qenya Lexicon. Since the Etymologies have the newer, reversed scenario, the case of cár appears as an anomaly among similar words. Tolkien later revised it to be consistent with his concurrent scenario.
