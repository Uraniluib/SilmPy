The Rohan language refers to the language spoken by the Rohirrim of Rohan.
==History==
The Rohan language is derived from the language of the Éothéod, who were among the Northmen and was related to other Northmen languages, such as those of  Rhovanion, Lake-town, and Dale. 
The Hobbits before their Wandering Days in the Vales of Anduin had contact with that people and their languages had many words in common. For example the Rohirrim had retained the legend of the being known as kûd-dûkan (translated as hol-bytla), a term which became kuduk by the Hobbits, the name they had for themselves.
Many archaic Hobbits names bear similarities to Rohans, since the ancestors of The Shire hobbits lived on the upper reaches of the Anduin, close to the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and there was apparently a good deal of linguistic cross-fertilisation.
Despite its relation to Westron, the Rohan language was not intelligible to its speakers. Legolas was unable to understand the songs, however he noted that the language is like the land itself: rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains.
==Structure==
Rohan names often have the element lô-/loh-, which means "horse". Lōgrad means "Rohan" or "Riddermark"; Lohtûr means "Éothéod".
The latter shows the element tûr also seen in the name Tûrac "Théoden".
==Name==
Tolkien did not give a definite specific name for the language of the Rohirrim other than in one manuscript, where he apparently uses the short name "Rohan" for this tongue (and also Christopher Tolkien, in one instance, refers to the language of Rohan as "Rohan"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), "Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings", published in A Tolkien Compass (edited by Jared Lobdell))., p. 153 
Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull in The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion also use the word "Rohan" but they call it "Rohanese" at one instance., pp. 750-81 Tolkien himself used the adjective Rohanese in The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor,, p. 8 but it is not clear by the context if the word is the name of a language, or simply an adjective. 
Robert Foster in The Complete Guide to Middle-earth uses the name Rohirric, which has stuck among the students of Tolkiens languages. Perhaps it was modelled on "Rohirrim" and the ending -ic of "Adûnaic". Christopher Gilson uses "Rohirric" in the List of Abbreviations to "Parma Eldalamberon 17",, p. 220 as well as Helge Fauskanger in Ardalambion.
Lisa Star has claimed that Rohirian is found in The Peoples of Middle-earth p. 55, which is untrue, and also in a manuscript labeled Marquette University15:10. It has been suggested that the manuscript actually says Rohirin (the ending -rin being an element seen in Sindarin), but it is just a theory.
==Inspiration==
Tolkien rendered the Rohan language as Old English, but also included Scandinavian names, such as Westfold.  Even modernized names show a strong Anglo-Saxon influence. Old English was supposed to render an archaic form of Westron, which was supposedly rendered by Modern English. This solution occurred to Tolkien in 1942, when he was searching for an explanation of the Eddaic name of the dwarves already published in The Hobbit.
Some words show the plural ending "-as", as were Old English nouns of the strong-masculine declension.
The Rohirrim used the Germanic patronymic "-ing".  They called themselves the Eorlingas, and Beorns people were the Beornings, Scylds people were the Scyldingas in Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology.
Théoden was referred to as "Théoden King", rather than "King Théoden", just as Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon kings had the word "konungr"/"cyning" ("king") added after their names, e.g. Hervarðar konungr, rather than before.
Some Old English names that render Rohirric words include:
* Éothéod: from "eoh" ("war-horse") and "þeod" ("folk", "people", "nation")
* Gríma: possibly from "grima" ("mask", "helmet", "ghost")
* Eorl: from "eorl" ("nobleman")
* Théodred: from "þeod" ("folk", "people", "nation") and "ræd" ("counsel")
===Translation===
As Westron is rendered in the novels with English, Rohan language is always translated through Old English. This is because J.R.R. Tolkien tried to reproduce for English readers its archaic flavour in relationship to the Common Speech. Westron is an amalgamated language which, although deriving from Adûnaic, was formed from the languages of the Middle Men, much like the English language with many influences from Celtic and Wikipedia:Norman language.
However, the relationships between the two pairs of languages is not identical: Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, but Rohan was not the direct ancestor of Westron, since the latter derives from Adûnaic.
In some cases, Tolkien did not provide genuine Old English words, but rather modernizations. Such names are:
*Edoras and Dunharrow instead of Eodoras, Dūnhaerg
*Snowbourn and Upbourn instead of Snāwburna, Upburnan
*Firien instead of Firgen in the names Halifirien, Firienfeld and Firienholt.
*Entwade, Entwash, Entwood instead of Entwaed, Entwaesc, Entwudu
*Woses instead of Wāsan; also isolated from the English term Woodwoses.
*Elfwine, Éothain, Shadowfax, Gríma, Gamling and Greyhame instead of Ælfwine, Éothegn, Sceadufaex, Wyrmtunga, Gameling, Grēghama
The reason was that those names were said to be intelligible by speakers of Westron; Gondorians were familiar of the place-names of Rohan (like Entwade), while Hobbits recognized some common elements with Hobbitish.
