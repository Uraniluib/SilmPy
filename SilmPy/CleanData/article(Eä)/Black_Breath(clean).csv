The Black Breath was a weapon used by the Nazgûl.  The Ringwraiths breath was poisonous and could overpower those affected by it.
==History==
In the evening of 29 September  Meriadoc Brandybuck left the Prancing Pony and went for a stroll in Bree.  He saw and followed (or was drawn by) a dark shadow, but then fell unconscious.  Aragorn stated that Merry had been overcome by the Black Breath.
In the last retreat before the city of Minas Tirith was besieged, on 13 March , Faramir was struck by a dart shot by one of the Haradrim, which rendered him unconscious.  After the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, on 15 March , Aragorn came to the Houses of Healing and recognized that Faramir was suffering from the Black Breath.  Aragorn used athelas to cure Faramir, which led to the rapidly spread news that the King had returned.
Earlier, it appears that both Merry and Éowyn were exposed to the Black Breath when they fought the Witch-king.  Aragorn, after treating Faramir, also aided these two with athelas.
