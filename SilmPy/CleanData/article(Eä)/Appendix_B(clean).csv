Appendix B is the second Appendix to The Lord of the Rings.  It is entitled The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands).  It primarily contains timelines (lists of years) from the Second Age, Third Age, and Fourth Age Ages and the events of those years.  There are also a few brief narrative sections, including a short discussion of the Wizards and how Gandalf received the Narya from Círdan.
The Tale of Years was said to have been put together at the Great Smials with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc Brandybuck, who collected much information from Rivendell.

;The Chief Days from the Fall of Barad-dur to the End of the Third Age
:It finishes the events of The Lord of the Rings, giving specific dates up through Samwise Gamgees return to Bag End.
;Later Events Concerning the Members of the Fellowship of the Ring
