Westemnet was the westernmost grasslands of Rohan beyond Entwash that spread until the rivers Isen, marking the western part of the land of the Riddermark.
The most important of Rohans settlements and fortifications lay to the south of the Westemnet, where the White Mountains rose up from the plain. Helms Deep was among these, and to the south-east was the seat of the Kings of Rohan, Edoras itself.
