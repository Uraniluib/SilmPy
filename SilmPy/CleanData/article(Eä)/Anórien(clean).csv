Anórien was a region and fiefdom of Gondor.
==History==
During the Elder Days, the region was occupied by Pre-Númenóreans. These were separated relatives of the House of Haleth while the Edain migrated to the west during the First Age. The aboriginal Drúedain fled to the forests of that region, hunted by the Men of Darkness.
At the end of the Second Age, the region was given to Anárion as part of the Realms in Exile and was named Anórien after him. Anárion built Minas Anor on Hill of Guard of the Mindolluin.
Peoples from Anórien, as well as from Ithilien and Calenardhon joined with Eldacar (King of Gondor) against Castamir in the Kin-strife.
As the Great Plague spread, cities were evacuated and many fled to Ithilien and Anórien.
Steward Túrin II fortified the isle of Cair Andros to defend Anórien.
During the War of the Ring, when Sauron released a secondary force from the Morannon, they overwhelmed the defenders of Cair Andros, and used the island to cross into Anórien. They blocked the eastward progress of the Rohirrim as they rode to Gondors aid, though after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Elfhelm and 3000 Rohirrim chased them down and pushed them back out of Anórien.
==Geography==
Anórien lay north of the line of the White Mountains, and formed a narrow strip of land consisting of the valleys of the White Mountains, and its borders were the Mering Stream in the west, and the Mouths of the Entwash in the north. Its eastern border was the border of Gondor at the Anduin.
After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod to become the Kingdom of Rohan, Anórien remained as the only part of the northern half of the realm. 
The Greenway road traversed the fief.
The land contained the Drúadan Forest and fertile farmlands. Except Minas Anor, no cities were in Anórien, but following the line of the North-South Road that led through Rohan to Arnor were built the Warning beacons of Gondor.
==Etymology==
The name is Sindarin for Sun-land; Sun "sun" and -ien place name suffix. Called Sunlending by the Rohirrim. 
The name does not refer to the Sun or the climate, but is heraldic, related to the name and the emblem of Anárion, son of Elendil: the land is immediately attached to the Minas Anor., p. 776
