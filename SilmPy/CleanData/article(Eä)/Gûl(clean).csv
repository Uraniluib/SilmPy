==Sindarin==
In Sindarin, gûl originally referred to "secret knowledge, arts" or "the deeper knowledge of the wise or skilled persons". However, the word came to be associated with Morgoths black arts  (as in the compound morgul). It is therefore also found glossed as "evil or perverted knowledge, necromancy, sorcery".
==Black Speech==
In the Black Speech, gûl (or gūl) is glossed as "(phantoms, shadow of dark magic, necromancer), slave, servant?", "Demons spirit". In The Lord of the Rings, gûl is translated as "wraiths" (as in Nazgûl, the Ringwraiths).
