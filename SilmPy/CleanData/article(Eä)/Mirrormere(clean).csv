Mirrormere was the lake located beneath the Great Gates of  Moria. It lay in the southeast corner of Dimrill Dale. Mirrormere was the source of the river Celebrant.
==History==
According to the Dwarves of Durins Folk, after Durin had awoken at Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, he travelled south until he came upon this lake. He looked down in it and saw a Durins Crown above his head, being the reflection of stars above, despite the fact it was day and the stars should not have been visible. Taking the crown as a sign, he founded the great city of Khazad-dûm beneath the mountains that fed Mirrormere. A pillar called Durins Stone was placed along the banks of the lake to mark the event.
During the events that led up to the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring passed by the lake after escaping Moria. Despite their hurry, Gimli would not leave without looking in the lake. Frodo Baggins joined him, and both saw Durins crown.
==Names==
In Khuzdul, the lake was called Kheled-zâram.
The Sindarin name (not appearing in The Lord of the Rings) was Nen Cenedril ("Lake Looking-glass")., p. 466 (note 39), p. 37
==Portrayal in adaptations==
