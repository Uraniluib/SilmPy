The Dominion of Men refers to the fact that Men remained the only speaking race on Arda, inheriting its mastery from the ancient Elves. For this they were sometimes called "The Usurpers" by the Elves. The Dominion specifically referred to the advent of the Fourth Age and beyond.
This began in the late Third Age, the "Fading Years" for the Elves, when most left Middle-earth and sailed to Aman. This was the case for example, of the Elvish realm of Dol Amroth, which was abandoned by the Elves before becoming a realm of Dúnedain. Meanwhile, other races, such as Dwarves and Ents, saw their numbers dwindling.  The Dominion of Men was exemplified in the extent of the Mannish language of Westron, which by the end of the Age was adopted by most of the other speaking races of the Westlands. 
By the time of the War of the Ring, the Dominion of Men was already projected. Saruman saw it as an opportunity and prepared Saurons rule for the Younger Days. He attempted to invite Gandalf to join this Power.
Gandalf spoke of the Dominion of Men when he and Aragorn stood in the high hallow on Mindolluin, where there grew a sapling of Nimloth of Númenor. Aragorns ascent to the Throne of Gondor and the Reunited Kingdom marked that new era.
The Dominion of Men officially began with the destruction of the One Ring, when the Three Rings lost their powers of preserving the lore and beauty as understood by the Eldar and their Keepers of the Three Rings passed over the Belegaer on the White Ship.
