==Etymology==
Lambengolmor is a Quenya word, glossed as "Loremasters of Tongues" in one manuscript. In another manuscript, the alternative spelling Lambeñgolmor is seen, and also glossed as "lingustic loremasters"., p. 6 Helge Fauskanger has noted that only the plural form is attested, of a possible singular form Lambengolmo. The word consists of lambe ("tongue, language") + ingolmo ("loremaster").
