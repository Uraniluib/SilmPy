The Dwarves of the Blue Mountains were the various Dwarves peoples in the Blue Mountains.
==History==
===First Age===
The Firebeards and Broadbeams awoke in Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains, and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost.
In the First Age the most notable Dwarves were the Dwarves of Nogrod and the Dwarves of Belegost.
Dwarves of the Ered Luin helped Finrod build Nargothrond, and also made for him the Nauglamír, and gave him his famous epithet, Felagund, Hewer of Caves. Finrod rewarded them with treasures he brought from Tirion.
===Second Age===
After the War of Wrath, much of the Ered Luin fell into the sea, and stunted the mountains (such as Dolmed, and Rerir). Most of the two Houses left the Ered Luin for Moria home of the Durins Folk, bringing much lore and craft and swelling its numbers.  Others stayed to build or rebuild their homes, and start over again.   
For hundreds of years the remnants of the Firebeards and Broadbeams toiled in the Ered Luin. The remnants of the two Houses seemed to having largely moved to the Southern range by the mid-Third Age.  
They likely trafficked and traded with the Elves of Lindon, the Men of Eriador and of course with Durins folk.
===Third Age===
After the death of King Thrór, his son Thráin sent messengers to all the Houses of the Dwarves requesting aid, and it can be assumed that both the western houses sent troops to fight in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. 
After the War, the remaining Western Dwarves went back to their countries, and a year later King Thráin and his people established a Thorins Halls in the Northern Ered Luin beyond the Little Lune.  This territory may have been given to them by the western Houses (It was part of their territory).  His people prospered in a fashion, and were swelled in numbers by many of the wandering folk of Durin.  They made things mostly of iron, trading with their neighboring kinsmen in the south, the Men of Eriador, and likely the Elves.
Years later after King Thorin went on the Quest of Erebor and was killed in the Battle of Five Armies, the Kingdom under the Mountain was re-established by the new king Dáin Ironfoot.  Many of the people of Durins folk went to him and it became a great and prosperous kingdom once again.
Even later in the Fourth Age there were still Dwarves in mines in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially south of the Gulf of Lune, still trading along the East Road.
