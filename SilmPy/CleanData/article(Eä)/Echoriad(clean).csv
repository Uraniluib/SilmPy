The Echoriath or Echoriad, the Encircling Mountains, were a mountain range in the north of Beleriand. 
They were part of the highlands around Dorthonion, with the Pass of Sirion separating them from the Ered Wethrin to the west; and the Pass of Anach separating them from the Ered Gorgoroth to the east. The southern part of the circle of mountains were called the Crissaegrim, which was the abode of eagles.
The Echoriath formed a natural circle of rock, enclosing the valley later called Tumladen, within which lay the Elves city of Gondolin. A hidden ravine provided the main access through the Echoriath &mdash; a way guarded by seven gates.
==History==
Maeglin prospected in the northern part of the Echoriad and found diverse and abundant metals.  From his mine, Anghabar, he found hard iron that he prized.
When Fingolfin died the eagle Thorondor carried his body to a mountain top north of Gondolin.  Turgon, the son of Fingolfin, came and built a Fingolfins Cairn over his body that no Orcs dared to approach.  Also in the aftermath of the Dagor Bragollach Húrin and Huor were the first men to enter Gondolin, but they did not traverse the hidden ravine to reach the city - instead they were borne aloft by the eagles of Thorondor over the Encircling Mountains.  Later they departed in the same manner and thus could not reveal the passage into Tumladen (and swore oaths to not reveal the valleys location).
Yet it was Húrin who, despite his oath, eventually and inadvertently revealed the location of Turgons realm to Morgoth.  Húrin came to the Encircling Mountains and cried out for Turgon to hear him in his hidden halls.  Húrin was unaware that spies of Morgoth heard his words and reported to their master where the Hidden Kingdom lay.
The host of Morgoth came to Gondolin, pouring over the Echoriad from the north and north east.  All would have died within the city but that Idril had made a secret tunnel.  She and Tuor led the remnants of the people of Gondolin out by this route and then they climbed into the mountains to the north, by the perilous pass known as the Cirith Thoronath.  The refugees were attacked by Orcs and a Balrogs.  While eagles dispersed the Orcs, Glorfindel fought with the Balrog upon a pinnacle of rock and both fell into the nearby abyss.  Like Fingolfin, Thorondor came and brought Glorfindels body up to the refugees, who buried him in a mound of stones beside the path.  The people could then proceed with their escape, and eventually came out of the mountains and into the vale of Sirion.
==Etymology==
Echoriath is Sindarin. It means "encircling fence", from echor "encircling" and iâth "fence"., entries echor and iâth
Christopher Tolkien mentioned that his fathers intent was to rename the Echoriath as Echoriad, but perhaps this knowledge eluded him while publishing The Silmarillion., note 27
In his Unfinished index of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gave an alternate name for the Encircling Mountains: Eryd Echor, using the plural eryd of the Sindarin word orod "mountain"., p. 62.
