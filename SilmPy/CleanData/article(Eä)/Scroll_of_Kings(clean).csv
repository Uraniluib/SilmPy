The Scroll of Kings was a list of all the King of Númenor of Númenor. These names were written in Quenya, the tongue of the High Elves of Aman. Even after the Kings of Númenor began to hate the Elves, they still used Quenya when they wrote their names into the Scroll, because they feared to break this tradition. For example, Ar-Adûnakhôr, the first King to take an Adûnaic royal name, had the Quenya translation Tar-Herunúmen written into the Scroll. The original Scroll of Kings was probably destroyed in the Downfall of Númenor, but copies of the same information, such as the Line of Elros (document), survived the disaster and were later preserved in Gondor.
