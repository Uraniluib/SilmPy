ëalar is a Quenya word which referred to such Spirits (creatures) who did not require a body in order to be complete (like the Maiar). Eälar are contrasted with fëar, which are the souls of beings whose natural state is to be incarnated in a body., p. 165 (commentary on §18)
==Etymology==
The word is related to Quenya ëala ("being"), and seems to be related to the Quenya verb Ea (verb) "be, exist". 
It has been suggested that -la is the present participle ending of verbs (cf. "-ing"; but Quenya -la only forms adjectival participles)Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/markirya.htm The Markirya Poem" (accessed 4 March 2011)
