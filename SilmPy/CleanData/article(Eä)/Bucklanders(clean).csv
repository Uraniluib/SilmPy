The inhabitants of Buckland on the eastern borders of the Shire, the Bucklanders acknowledged the Master of Buckland as their leader. The Brandybuck Familys, descendants of Gorhendad Oldbuck who founded Buckland, were considered the most important family of the Bucklanders.
The Brandybucks had a strong Fallohides strain in their blood, it is said, and this made them more adventurous than many of their more conservative neighbours in the Shire. They did not share the Shire-hobbits fear of water, for example, and the Bucklanders boats where often seen on the Brandywine River that bordered their land.
On the eastern border of Buckland lay the dangerous Old Forest, and the constant threat of the dark trees made the Bucklanders somewhat hardier than typical hobbits.
