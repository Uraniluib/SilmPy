Rhûn refers to the little-known lands in eastern Middle-earth. Almost nothing of the lands beyond the great Sea of Rhûn is known (see Land of the Sun).
==History==
The first Elves awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were led to the Westlands by Oromë. Some Elves forsook this Great Journey and chose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.
The first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met Dwarves and Avari. The ancestors of the Edain and Drúedain traveled west out of Rhûn. At the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, some of the Mannish tribes traveling west separated and their languages soon diverged. Other men remained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of Morgoth and, later, Sauron. These men were called Easterlings, and they led many attacks against Gondor and its allies during the Third Age.
In the Second Age or Third Ages the Blue Wizards went into the deep regions of Rhûn, never to return, pp. 384-85. Saruman may have joined them before returning and occupying Isengard. During the Watchful Peace, Sauron went to hiding in Rhûn for 400 years and gathered the Easterlings to his service; the Blue Wizards failed to discover his eastern stronghold.
The most western parts of Rhûn were conquered by Gondor twice, under the Kings Rómendacil I and Rómendacil II, but the Númenóreans never had full control over it. Western Rhûn was finally subdued in the Fourth Age under Aragorn and his son Eldarion.
==Geography==

The western part of Rhûn was given in maps of the Westlands of Middle-earth. It contained the great Sea of Rhûn, connected the River Running in the northwest. A forest lay to the north-east of the Sea, and near the south-western shores there were many hills. South-west of the Sea of Rhûn lay also the land of Dorwinion.
The inland Sea of Rhûn was located in western Rhûn on the border between Rhûn and Rhovanion. There were mountains on the southwest side of the Sea of Rhûn and a forest on the north-east side. Wild white Kine of Araw, or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.
Further east in Rhûn were ancient regions where the Children of Ilúvatar first awoke: Cuiviénen for the Elves, which lay on the shores of Sea of Helcar near the Orocarni (Red Mountains); and Hildórien for Men. Four Dwarves clans were also located in Rhûn, pp. 301, 322 (note 24); their mansions were at least as far east from Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains as Mount Gundabad lay east of the Blue Mountains. Additionally, Sauron maintained a fortress in Rhûn in the Third Age.
===The Dwarves of Rhûn===
Dwarves emerged in Middle-earth in the Years of the Trees; after Elves but before Men. When the Fathers of the Dwarves awoke in far-flung corners of Middle-earth, some of them found themselves in Rhûn, and there they founded kingdoms under the mountains of the East. These four clans are the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks and Stonefoots., pp. 301, 322 (note 24) In the Third Age, Dwarves of those kingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earths other Dwarf clans in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which was fought in and under the Misty Mountains. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earths western lands, where some of them met Frodo Baggins.
==Etymology==
The word rhûn means "east" in Sindarin. Compare Quenya rómen.
==Other  of the legendarium==
In an addition by J.R.R. Tolkien (dating from 1948 or later) inscribed on his General Map of Middle-earth, an arrow is drawn from the River Running with the direction to the end of the map, and carries the note: "To Sea of Rûnaer". Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull suggest that Rûnaer is likely an alternative name of Rhûn., p. 199
==Inspiration==
Rhûn and the easternmost lands of Middle-earth seem to be based primarily on the lands of Wikipedia:South Asia, Wikipedia:Central Asia, and Wikipedia:East Asia.
In the earliest drafts of The Hobbit, Bilbo offered to walk from the The Shire "to cancelled: Wikipedia:Hindu Kush the Wikipedia:Gobi Desert and fight the Wild Wire worm(s) of the Wikipedia:China.", p. 9 In a slightly later version J.R.R. Tolkien altered this to say "to the last desert in the East and fight the Wild Wireworms of the Chinese",, p. 40 and in the final version it was altered once more to say "to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert."
The Wainriders, as well as the Balchoth, were known for traveling in great camps of wagons which they fortified. Given the eastern origins of the group, this bears many similarities to the Wikipedia:Orda (organization) military structure employed by the Wikipedia:Turkic peoples and Wikipedia:Mongols peoples.
