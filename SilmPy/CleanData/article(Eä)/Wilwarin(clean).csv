Wilwarin was one of the constellations of Arda.
Wilwarin was created by the Valar Varda. It was set in the heavens of Arda to welcome and give light to the Elves, who were just waking in Cuiviénen.J.R.R. Tolkien and Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, "Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor"
==Etymology==
Wilwarin (wilwarind-, pl. wilwarindi) means "butterflies" in Quenya.J.R.R. Tolkien and Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Lost Road and Other Writings, "The Etymologies", entry WIL-, pp. 398-9
Wilwarin comes from the same root (wil-, "fly, float in air") as the name for the Ring of Air, Vilya, and shares this common root with the Sindarin word gwilith, "air".
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien gave no description of the constellation, nor any counterpart in our modern-day constellations, but Christopher Tolkien suggested that it could be the commonly-known constellation Wikipedia:Cassiopeia_(constellation).J.R.R. Tolkien and Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, "Index of Names" Cassiopeia is a plausible candidate for being Wilwarin as its "W"-shape is a reasonable match to that of a butterfly.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of J.R.R. Tolkiens notes, the name of the constellation is "Vilvarin".J.R.R. Tolkien and Christopher Tolkien (ed.), Morgoths Ring, "The Later Quenta Silmarillion", pp. 160, 166
From other published writings, we know of a few other forms of the word wilwarin. The words wilwarindëa and wilwarindië (older Qenya form was wilwarindeënJ.R.R. Tolkien, The Monsters and the Critics, "A Secret Vice", pp. 213, 216, 220) are the respective singular and plural forms meaning "like a wilwarin or butterfly".J.R.R. Tolkien, "Early Elvish Poetry" in Christopher Gilson (ed.), Parma Eldalamberon, Parma Eldalamberon 16, 2006, p. 96 We also know of the Qenya form wilwarindon, "as a butterfly".
