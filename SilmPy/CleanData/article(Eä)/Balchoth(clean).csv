The Balchoth were a clan of Easterlings under the sway of Dol Guldur, who lived in  Rhovanion, the lands southeast of the forest of Mirkwood. They were no doubt related to the Wainriders.
They had crude weapons and few horses, used mostly for drawing their large wains.
==History==
In  of the Third Age, they attempted, with the assistance of Orcs, an invasion of Calenardhon, a minimally populated northern province of Gondor. After pushing back the northern Gondorian army, they were repulsed by Eorl, who arrived with the Éothéod, after receiving the plea of Cirion late. The Balchoth were no match for the horsemen of the Éothéod, and during the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, they were hunted down and utterly destroyed.
==Etymology==
The compound Balchoth consists of Westron balc ("horrible") + Sindarin hoth ("horde"). It was actually a generic term for disliked peoples, including the Orcs. (Note 24)
