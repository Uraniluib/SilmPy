File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - The Nine.jpg
The Nine Rings were those of the Rings of Power that Sauron used to corrupt Men to his service; those who took the Nine Rings became the Nazgûl.
==History==
The rings were made along with the others in Eregion and were forged by Celebrimbor.  Those were locked away in one of the safes of Eregion, but all were captured by Sauron. He gave nine of them to nine kings of Men, three of which were Númenóreans and Khamûl was an Easterlings.  
The owners of the nine eventually became the Nazgûl.      
During the end of the Third Age, possibly Sauron had taken the Nine Rings with him in order to augment his power.

==Effect==
The Rings of Power gave their wearer powerful magical abilities and gave them the ability to influence peoples will. 
On Men those effects could be special: The rings gave a very long life, but the wearer would begin to feel worn out and eventually fade away into a wraith.  The nine kings given the rings turned into Nazgûl because Sauron was able to take control of the rings.
==Appendix==
===Possession of the Nine Rings===
In The Council of Elrond, Gandalf says that the Nazgûl kept their Rings by saying "The Nine the Nazgûl keep", The Council of Elrond. However in most other references, it is mentioned that Sauron had taken them. Furthermore, Frodo doesnt see any Rings on them on Weathertop, and it is believed that if they did wear the Rings, they would have been fully Unseen (including their cloaks).
Its possible that the line in the Council of Elrond represents Tolkiens earlier intention that the Nazgûl should still be wearing their Rings; if thats so, he later changed his mind and simply missed revising that sentence.http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q0-InvRiders
