habar (or sabar)S usually mutates to H in Sindarin. is an unattested Sindarin word likely meaning "delved mine", being reconstructed from an element found in the compound names Anghabar and Nornhabar.Didier Willis, http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókës Sindarin Dictionary at http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com (accessed 19 June 2011), p. 327
Note that this word is debatable as it is seen only in these compounds. Didier Willis has suggested that J.R.R. Tolkien perhaps reused the old Qenya root SAPA "dig, excavate" as a base for this word. This seems likely, since SAP- and a derivative sapnā reappear in the 1950s Outline of Phonology as the source for samna "delved hole, pit"., p. 86
