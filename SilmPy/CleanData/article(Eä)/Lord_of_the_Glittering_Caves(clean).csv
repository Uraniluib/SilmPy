Lord of the Glittering Caves was a title created by the Dwarves Gimli son of Gl√≥in for the overlordship of Glittering Caves. It is not known who succeeded him, if anyone.
After the downfall of Sauron, Gimli led a party of the Dwarves of Lonely Mountain to Aglarond, the Glittering Caves of the White Mountains within the realm of Rohan, of which there was an entrance in Helms Deep. There they founded a colony, and Gimli became known as the Lord of the Glittering Caves. His Dwarves performed great services for the Rohirrim and the Men of Gondor, of which the most famous was the making of new gates for Minas Tirith, forged out of mithril and steel.
