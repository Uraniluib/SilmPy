Calenardhon was a wide green landscape in the north of Gondor, part of Anórien.
==History==
It was devastated or deserted by the Great Plague and during the Watchful Peace the Númenórean garrisons of the forts were not renewed, and local chieftains (whose subjects were increasingly of mixed blood) gained more control. The Dunlendings decided to repopulate it.
During the rule of the Steward of Gondor Cirion, Gondor faced a series of attacks by the Balchoth, and Calenardhon was overrun by these evil people. Cirion sent messages for help to Gondors old allies, including the Éothéod, to help defend Gondor.
Eorl the Young answered the call, and helped Gondor defeat the Balchoth at the Field of Celebrant. In gratitude, Cirion granted all Calenardhon, except for Anórien, to the Éothéod.
After the Éothéod settled in Calenardhon, the land became known as Rohan or the Riddermark.
==Etymology==
Calenardhon is Sindarin, meaning "Green Province"J.R.R. Tolkien, Nancy Smith, "Index questions". Cf. Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull (HarperCollinsPublishers 2008), The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 477 or "the (great) green region" (calen "green" + ardhon "province, great region"). 
The hypothetical Old Sindarin would likely be *Kalinardondo.http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/archive.html 2000 "Cabor" edition of the Sindarin Dictionary (accessible through http://www.jrrvf.com/cgi-bin/hisweloke/register.cgi?license=show here); entries "calen" and "ardhon"
Earlier names used by Tolkien for this region were Elenarda (disambiguation) > Kalen(arda) > Kalinarda > Calenardan >  Calenardon.
