Ilurambar (Quenya, pron. ) is a term mentioned in The Book of Lost Tales Part One and is a Qenya name for the Walls of the World. Earlier it was called the Wall of Things.
According to the Ambarkanta, the Walls are a shell that fence Vaiya and the world from emptiness and darkness (the Void). The World and all its airs are globed inside them. They are totally impervious and their only opening is the Door of Night which is guarded by Earendil.
