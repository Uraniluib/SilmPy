A-affection or A-mutation is a phonology phenomenon in the Sindarin language through its evolution from Old Sindarin, regarding the final vowels of a word.
The phenomenon is summarized as -iCa > -eC: the final -a vowel caused the preceding i to slid into e. It also caused change of u into o.
Since all final vowels disappeared in mature Sindarin, final -a also disappeared, leaving as trace of its existence the change of the preceding vowel.
The phenomenon is seen mostly in adjectives ending in -ina resulting in the common Sindarin adjectival ending -en. Other endings which possibly show A-affection are -eth (*-itta), -eb (*-ipa), -eg (*-ika)
==Examples==
*OS rista > resta > rest p.365
*OS berina > berena > beren entry BER 
*CE taika > taeka > taeg p.309
*CE *aklari(n)kwâcf. Quenya Alcarinqua > aklarepa > aglareb
*OS *kulda > kolda > coll p.414
Mithrimin perhaps did not undergo the A-affection pp.133,134. Hence we have OS *lâmina > S. loven but M. lómin
