Cair Andros was a large river-island in the Anduin that resembled a ship, hence the name.
==Geography==
The island itself was long and narrow, like a ship, a little over ten miles in length. Its northern end of sharp rocks split the waters of the upstream Anduin in a bubbling foam like the "prow" of a ship, and this gave the island its name., Footnote 1 Cair Andros was covered with trees for much of its length.
The island was located to the east of the land of Anórien and about fifty miles, p. 79 north of Minas Tirith. Because of its location it was of strategic importance, and was one of the only practical means for an army to cros the river (the others were the bridge of Osgiliath and, until the formation of Rohan, the Undeeps). As such, the island housed Gondorian fortifications at various points of history.
==History==
In the First Age, as believed by historians in Gondor, the first men to cross the Anduin were the Drúedain.  It was thought that the Drúedain came westward south of Mordor, turned north through Ithilien, and crossed the Great River at or near Cair Andros before eventually settling in the vales of the White Mountains., Further Notes on the Drúedain
Upon the establishment of the realm of Gondor, the island grew in strategic importance: after the granting of Calenardhon to the Éothéod in  (who created the realm of Rohan) Cair Andros and Osgiliath remained as vulnerable crossing-points for the Gondorians who took Cair Andros risk seriously. Amon Dîn, the first of the Warning beacons of Gondor, was set up originally to warn the citizens of Minas Tirith if Cair Andros was ever breached., Note 51
Gondor took steps to fortify the island, too.  In  Minalcar, Regent of Gondor to King Narmacil I, defeated the Easterlings and upon his return fortified the west bank of the Anduin up to the Limlight, which may have included the fortification of Cair Andros. 
The island was also manned at the time of King Ondohers fall. in , 
Centuries later, Túrin II fortified the island again in about the year  to protect Anórien.
===The War of the Ring===
On the same day that the Witch-king rode from Minas Morgul with the armies that would Siege of Gondor, Sauron released a smaller force (more than 6,000 Orcs and Men) from the Morannon. They overwhelmed the Gondorian defenses of Cair Andros on 10 March,  and used the island to cross into Anórien. This force blocked the eastward progress of the Rohirrim as they rode to Gondors aid. 
However the Rohirrim used the secret ride down Stonewain Valley and, after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, they chased that force down and pushed them back out of Anórien. Apparently the island was held by that force for some days. 
On 23 March, in his march on Mordor, Aragorn gave a leave to one thousand scared young men from Rohan and Lossarnach from his main army, with orders to retake the island if necessary. They must have succeeded, since its moorings were used by the ships of Gondor, as glimpsed by Frodo Baggins after completing his Quest.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name Cair Andros translates to "Ship of Long Foam". cirya means "ship", and means "long", and ros means (in this context at least) "foam"., p. 121
