Therefore Tolkien dramatically altered his conception of the Blue Wizards. They no longer arrived in Middle-earth along with Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast in c. . Instead they arrived much earlier, at roughly the same time as Glorfindel in  c. . Whilst Glorfindel was tasked with aiding Elrond with the war in Eriador, the Blue Wizards were destined to journey to the East. Tolkien no longer believed that they drifted from their mission; instead he makes it clear that they played a decisive role in the downfall of Sauron at the end of both the Second Age and the Third Age. They became known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, Darkness-slayer and East-helper, and were successful in preventing the forces of the East from outnumbering those of the Free peoples in the West.
Based on these later writings, a history of the Blue Wizards can be summarised as the following:
*The two Blue Wizards were sent to Middle-earth at roughly the same time as Glorfindel in c.  (and similarly at the behest of the Valar), the Year of Dread, when Sauron forged the One Ring and completed the building of Barad-dûr.
*The Blue Wizards journeyed into the East of Middle-earth, where they remained; they were not heard or seen of west of Mordor.
*There they became known as Morinehtar and Rómestámo, Darkness-slayer and East-helper.
*The Blue Wizards were able to hinder Saurons operations in the East, aiding the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance.
*During the early Third Age and until the end of the Watchful Peace, they were tasked with finding where Sauron dwelt. They failed.
*Morinehtar and Rómestámo ensured that the forces of the East did not outnumber the West, thus helping secure victory for the Free peoples in War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name Ithryn Luin consists of ithron ("wizards"; plural of ithron) and luin ("blue").

Morinehtar is described as meaning "Darkness-slayer", likely based on the Quenya words mori- ("darkness") and nehtar ("slayer").
Rómestámo (pron. ; or Róme(n)star) is a Quenya name meaning "East-helper"., pp. 384-5, 391 (note 28)

2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Gandalf mentions the Blue Wizards when he explains the number of Wizards, and says that he has forgotten their names.
:Since the film production team does not have the rights to include material from sources other than The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the decision to include the line "Blue Wizards" (only appearing in Unfinished Tales, p. 244) has been regarded as controversial.
