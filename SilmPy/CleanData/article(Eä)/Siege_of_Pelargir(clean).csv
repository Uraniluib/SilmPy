The Siege of Pelargir was the aftermath of the last battle of the Kin-strife of Gondor.
==History==
In  the rightful King Eldacar (King of Gondor) slew Castamir at the Battle of the Crossings of Erui.  Led by his sons, Castamirs kin and the people of the fleets retreated and held out for one year in the port city of Pelargir.  The siege could not be broken because Eldacar had no ships, which allowed the rebels to resupply and gather all of the support that they could.  In  the rebels sailed away to Umbar and established a lordship independent of Gondor.  This refuge of enemies lasted for generations, until finally subdued by King Aragorn in the Fourth Age.
