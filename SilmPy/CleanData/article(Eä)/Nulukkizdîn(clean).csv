Nulukkizdîn or Nulukkhizdīn was a hall of the Petty-dwarves on the river Narog.
==History==
Nulukkizdîn was delved by Dwarves before the Elves were exiled from Valinor. Over the years, its population waned, and others were hunted to near-extinction by the Elves, who were unfamiliar with the Petty-dwarves. Nulukkizdîn was eventually abandoned, and repopulated by Elves. Finrod founded Nargothrond in its stead. After Nargothrond fell to Glaurung, the last Petty-dwarf, Mîm, reclaimed it, but he was slain by Húrin.
==Etymology==
Tolkien provided no translations of either Nulukkizdîn or Nulukkhizdīn. The last element is usually believed to be the Khuzdul root for "Dwarf", Kh-Z-D.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul", published at Ardalambion Whether this is a true Khuzdul word or a Petty-dwarvish dialect is unknown, but circumstantial evidence points to the latter option. The Angerthas Daeron and its specific Dwarven variation Angerthas Moria, do not have a symbol for the letter Î. Other than in Nulukkizdîn, it only appears in Khîm and Mîm, the names of two Petty-dwarves.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In The Silmarillion, the name is spelled Nulukkizdîn; however, Christopher Tolkien has noted that in the original manuscript, his father used the spelling Nulukkhizdīn. It replaced an earlier spelling Nulukkhizidûn., "The Later Quenta Silmarillion", "Of the Siege of Angband"
Tolkiens later notes on the origin of Nargothrond give a different Dwarvish name, Nar(u)kuthûn, derived from a Dwarvish name of the Narog, *Naruka. Tolkien includes the words "of Petty-dwarves" between parentheses behind the mention of its Dwarvish origin., page 47 Whether Tolkien ever intended to replace Nulukkhizdīn with Nar(u)kuthûn is unknown.
