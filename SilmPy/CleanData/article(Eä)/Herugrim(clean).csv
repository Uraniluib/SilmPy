__NOTOC__
Herugrim was the sword of King Théoden of Rohan, hidden from him for many years by his traitorous councilor Gríma. After being cured by Gandalf, Théoden recovered the sword, and rode with it to the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
==Etymology==
Herugrim means "Very fierce or cruel, savage" in Rohirric, as translated through Old English. It has been noted that herugrim is in the Wikipedia:Mercian dialect of Old English (the spelling of the "standard" Wikipedia:West Saxon dialect (Old English) would have been heorugrim)., pp. 372, 408Tom Shippey, The Road to Middle-earth
