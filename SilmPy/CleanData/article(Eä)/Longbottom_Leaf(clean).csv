Longbottom Leaf was one of the three varieties of pipe-weed recorded as being the most sought-after, the other two being Old Toby and Southern Star. 
Longbottom in the Southfarthing was the first place in the Shire where pipe-weed was grown, and so Longbottom Leaf must have been one of the oldest and most established types (if not the original variety). The first Leaf-grower was Tobold Hornblower, and his family continued the tradition. 
Barrels of Longbottom Leaf were stashed by Saruman in Isengard. Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took who found the barrels in its ruins, noticed the brand-marks of the Hornblower Family and the date .

:The smoke from Longbottom Leaf takes the form of a horizontal smoke ring that appears behind the characters head. This effect appears to be broken or bugged. From the front, only the default cloud of thick smoke can be seen.
