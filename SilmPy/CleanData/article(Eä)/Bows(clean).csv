Bows were a common weapon in Arda. All peoples, Good and Evil, were known to have used them, most notable of them being the Elves, the Númenóreans, Rohirrim, Orcs and even Hobbits.Anthony Burdge, Jessica Burke, "Weapons, Named"; in J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment (edited by Michael D.C. Drout)
==Overview==
Bows varied in shape, size and material. While Elves flawless bows were made from wood, Númenóreans and Orcs bows were made of steel, forged in armories. It is said in a poem that Eärendil wielded a bow "made of dragon-horn".
==Bows by Faction==
*Elves of Doriath and Lothlórien used longbows which were, as their name suggests, longer bows which could shoot farther and higher than any other types of bows. Elves were the first race to develop and master the use of bows, and later passed their knowledge to Men.
*Númenóreans used a type of bow called the steelbow, which was hollow and made of steel, as its name implies. It was much feared by their enemies.
* The Gondorians army contains units of archers who use a longbow. The bows are made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28 inches long with four-inch steel tips. Theyre accurate up to 200 yards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds the arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers. Bows were also the primary weapon of the Rangers of Ithilien.
*Rohirrim archers used shortbows, possibly because they fought mounted on horses. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by other Men, having a range of only 125 yards.
*Hobbits also used bows. Hobbit archers fought for Arnor in the Battle of Fornost, and also participated in the Battle of Bywater.
*Orcs used bows for hunting, as well as weapons of war. Orcish bows were made of steel, and thus were likely heavy and difficult to use. Bows and crossbows were used as a weapon by the fierce Uruk-hai in the Battle of the Hornburg.
==Notable bowmen==
* Beleg who bore Belthronding
* Bard who slew the Dragons Smaug with his Black Arrow
* Legolas, a member of the Fellowship of the Ring
==In other languages==
*Quenya: quinga
*Sindarin/Noldorin: ping, cú
*Nandorin: cogn
The forms quinga, ping are cognates deriving from the Primitive Quendian kwingā., entry KWIG (in that source the first word is spelled qinga, and the second is Noldorin.
The form cogn, is derived from Primitive Quendian kuȝnā, itself representing the root KUȜ., entry KUȜ, p. 365
==Inspirations==
It is possible Tolkiens fascination with bows came from Red Indian stories:

==Portrayal in adaptations==
2001-2003: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Bows, just like all weapons from the films, were designed during the pre-production by artists like Warren Mahy, with aid from Alan Lee and John Howe. The majorty of them were hand-crafted by Weta Workshop employees.Weta Workshop (featurette)
