aha is a noun meaning "rage" in Quenya., Note, The names of the letters
 Image:Harma.gifAha was also the later name in Quenya of the eleventh letter of the Tengwar alphabet and the third letter of the third grade or Tyellë, which contains "voiceless spirants".  It was the third letter in the third series of consonants.
For written Quenya, the third series is used for the k-series, the Calmatéma.  Originally the letter Aha was called Harma and it represented spirant CH in all positions.  While the letter retains this value in medial positions, over time the sound softened into breath H at the beginning of words and the name of the letter when so used is Aha.
