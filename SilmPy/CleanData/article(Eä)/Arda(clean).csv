Arda (Quenya: "Realm", pronounced ) was the Quenya name for the world as a whole. Arda was created within Eä by Ilúvatar. It was then shaped by the Valar, with continental masses such as Middle-earth and Aman, and oceans, like Belegaer. 
Arda was the home of Elves, Men, Dwarves and other :Portal:Characters as well as the kelvar and olvar.  The Ainur govern the world under Ilúvatars mandate.

==Beginnings==
:Main article: Years of the Lamps
Arda was first brought into existence with the Music of the Ainur, for the purpose of creating a home for the Children of Ilúvatar. Ilúvatar appointed the Valar as its masters, and was built mainly by Manwe, Aule and Ulmo. They invented its geography, for at the time it was largely without feature and gave it symmetry and form. But then Morgoth wanted Arda for himself, and the two sides engaged in the titanic First War where Arda Marred and its plan was altered.
As for light source, the Valar decided upon Two Lamps. One, a blue light, was placed at the north, and it was called Illuin. The other, a golden light, was placed at the very southernmost point, and was called Ormal. Aulë, craftsman of the Valar, forged two towers: Helcar and Ringil (tower), placed at the north and south  respectively. The Valar chose as their own home the green isle Almaren in the center of Arda between the two towers.
It was at that time that Morgoth made his first attempt, spreading chaos across Arda. He destroyed the Lamps and the Towers, ruining the symmetry of the world. At this time, the continents of Aman, Endor, and the Uttermost East were formed. In the midst of Endor where the Two Lamps fell into ruin, the Sea of Helcar and the Sea of Ringil formed.
==Geography==
===Before the Shifting===
File:Sage - Almaren.png in the middle. The Iron Mountains can be seen on the North, created by Morgoth to protect himself from the Valar.
Arda was originally flat, like a plate. Encircling the continents was Ekkaia, the Encircling Sea. Farthest to the West was the great continent of Aman, composed primarily of two geographical features: the Plain of Valinor, and the Pelóri Mountains. Taniquetil was the highest mountain in this range, and in the world. Separating Aman from the lands to the east was the great sea of Belegaer.
Across Belegaer was Middle-earth, known also as Endor or the Hither Lands. The west side of this land mass was called Beleriand, the north Dor Daedeloth, and the east Palisor. According to J.R.R. Tolkiens earlier maps, it was in Palisor that there was the great inland Sea of Helcar, and the shores of Cuiviénen. At its farthest northwestern point, Middle-earth was joined to Aman by the Helcaraxë, a deathly cold region of grinding ice. 
Middle-earth was dominated by many mountain ranges. Separating Beleriand from the inner lands of Middle-earth were the Blue Mountains, the Blue Mountains. To the far east there were the Orocarni, the Red Mountains. Between the Blue Mountains and Red Mountains, Melkor had raised up the Misty Mountains, the Misty Mountains, to hinder the hunts of the Vala Oromë Middle-earth. These three northern ranges were joined together at their northernmost ends by the Iron Mountains, raised by Melkor in the ages before the fall of the Two Lamps. 
In the south of Middle-earth were the Grey Mountains (ancient), and in the southeast there were the Yellow Mountains. In the far east between the Orocarni in the north and the Yellow Mountains in the south there lay the Mountains of the Wind. However, when the Valar went to war against Melkor in the War for the Sake of the Elves, much of Arda was changed again. The Yellow Mountains and the Mountains of the Wind were lost, and the Great Gulf formed between Beleriand and the lands to the far south. The Great Gulf was soon connected to the Sea of Helcar through the Straits of the World. To the east, the East Sea and the Sea of Ringil joined together, dividing Middle-earth from a new continent known only as the Dark Lands or the South Lands.  p. 250-251
In its earliest days, Middle-earth was dominated by a great forest spanning from the western shores to the Misty Mountains and possibly beyond. However, this great forest dwindled throughout the ages, remaining only in the regions of the Old Forest, Fangorn Forest, Lothlórien, and Eryn Vorn. Mirkwood may also have been a remnant of this vast forest.
To the farthest east possible was the Uttermost East, with a great curved mountain range called the Walls of the Sun.  In the Ambarkanta it is called the “Dark Land of the Sun”. Corresponding to Taniquetil was the mountain Kalormë.
===Second Age and Beyond===
File:Darrell Sweet - The Fall of Numenor.jpg - The Fall of Númenor
During the tumultuous War of Wrath, the Valar broke and reshaped much of the world. The lands of Beleriand sank beneath the Great Sea in this conflict, drowning much lands west of the Blue Mountains. There were some islands that remained of the old world: Tol Fuin, Tol Morwen, and Himring. On the mainland, only the realm of Lindon survived the sinking of Beleriand. Lindon and the Blue Mountains were split in two after the conflict by the Gulf of Lune, possibly an eastward expansion of the ancient Bay of Balar.http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Hisweloke - Géographie - Mystère géographiques (1) : Mont Dolmed et cités naines... The mainlands shrank back furthest in the Northern Waste of the world, where the Icebay of Forochel was formed. To the south, the sinking of Beleriand robbed the Great Gulf of its northwestern ends, forming the Bay of Belfalas out of what remained.
After this catastrophic conflict, Ossë raised Elenna – a large, star-shaped isle – out of Belegaer, where the kingdom of Númenor would soon be settled.
The second great change was the Akallabêth. In this cataclysm, the world was stretched and made into the shape of a sphere. At that time Aman and the island of Tol Eressëa were removed from the Circles of the World, and became inaccessible save by the Straight Road. It is said that new continents were made in place of the Undying Lands. Once again, the western coasts of Middle-earth changed, retreating in some places and advancing in others. It is unknown if the Uttermost East survived the Fall of Númenor.
==Eschatology==
The Elves held to the concept of Arda Marred. In the beginning, at the time of the Music of the Ainur, was Arda Unmarred. According to the idea of Arda Unmarred, the world was originally “unstained” by evil. It became Arda Marred after Melkor entered and introduced chaos. They also clung to the idea that one day the world would become Arda Healed. According to this belief, Arda Healed will not come about until the Dagor Dagorath, the Last Battle.
==Tengwa==
File:Arda (tengwa).gifArda is also the name in Quenya of the twenty-sixth letter of the Tengwar alphabet., Note, The names of the letters It is a modification of Rómen (letter 25).  In written Quenya Arda is used for RD. In other modes this letter represents voiceless R (or RH)., Note, The additional letters  The Westron name for this letter is Rhó.See Westron Tengwar


==Etymology==
Arda derives from the Primitive Quendian word gardā meaning "bounded or defined place, region"., pp. 402, 413
===Other names===
Arda is the Quenya name of the World, with its atmosphere and the celestial objects. The term Ambar is roughly equivalent and it probably refers to Earth without the celestial objects. It was also called Kingdom of Earth/Arda/Manwë and Little Kingdom. 
In Adûnaic the words kamât "earth", p. 311 and dāira "Earth", p. 247 are given at different points. Another possible word is Abat-, seen in the royal name Ar-Abattârik (Quenya: Ardamin).
The Valarin name, from which Quenya Arda derived, was Aþāraphelūn ("appointed dwelling")., p. 401
==Theories==
Using the known sizes of Beleriand and Middle-earth when compared to the size of Beleriand on Map V of the Ambarkanta maps, Karen Wynn Fonstad has speculated that flat Ardas diameter was probably about 6,800 miles. However, Diagram III of the Ambarkanta shows that the "Old Lands" made up half of Arda made round, implying that flat Arda would have been around 12,451 miles across, half the earths circumference. Precise estimations of the size of Arda are difficult to determine with Map V of the Ambarkanta, which is said by Christopher Tolkien to be "a very rough sketch not to be interpreted too strictly".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
File:J.R.R. Tolkien - I Vene Kemen.png
In the early Book of Lost Tales, the Qenya name for the Earth was kemi as well as mar. An early schematic map of that era, displays the flat earth like a ship floating in the ocean of Vai.
In the next phase of the legendarium, as described in The Ambarkanta, the world has the Qenya names Ilu (being the wholeness of existence, the world, with its sky and air, equivalent to Arda of the later Legendarium) or Ambar (being the "earthy", concrete part of Ilu) suspended in the Void.
File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map I.jpg.
Above the lands of Arda was Vista, the lowermost airs where the birds fly. Surrounding Vista were the airs of Ilmen, the upper airs where the Stars were set. The airs of Ilmen met with the earth in Valinor and the Uttermost East where it was widest, and the airs of Ilmen were narrowest in the far north and south. Beyond Ilmen was Vaiya, the Encircling Sea which surrounds Arda on all its sides. It is said that the waters of Vaiya were more alike to air in the regions farthest above the earth, and alike to water beneath the earth. Surrounding all of Arda beyond the Vaiya was the Ilurambar, the Walls of the World, a cold and transparent globed barrier like ice and glass and steel, passable only by the Doors of Night. Beyond the Ilurambar there is naught but the Void.
The name "Arda" first appears in a later version of the Ainulindalë from 1951, where the term "Ea" also appears, with Arda now being just a small part in the vast regions of Creation and not equated with it.
In the later Round World version of the Silmarillion, there is the consideration that there are other worlds in Eä beside Arda where the innumerable Ainur labored, but Arda is of central importance in the Great Tale of Eä, as it is the stage of the conflict between the Great Enemy and the Eruhini. The distant worlds, and the Ainur who shaped them, are beyond the thought of Elves and Men.
