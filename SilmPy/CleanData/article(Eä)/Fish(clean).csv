Fish were common throughout the bodies of water in Arda. 
==History==
Fish formed the chief source of food in Númenor, as it was abundant throughout the coast of the island. The fisherfolk dwelt mainly in Nindamos, built on the hards of a marshy land. Guild of Venturers of Númenor were mostly drawn from the fisher folk.  
When the Númenóreans travelled to Middle-earth, they encountered the Pre-Númenóreans there. Though some of them, along the mouths of Morthond and Gwathló, had crude fisheries, they had fallen out of use as its people fled towards the mountains. The Stoors that dwelt in the Vales of Anduin also had fish as their main food. Two of them, Déagol and Sméagol, were fishing when they found the One Ring, lost in the river Anduin.
The Gondorians, much like their forefathers, ate fish. The Ethir Anduin was populated by fisher-folk, who often went out to Belegaer on boats, because fishing was the most profitable business.
Though Hobbits did not generally hunt or fish for leasure, they did angle for food now and then. One of the favourite spots for anglers was near The Golden Perch, which took its name for the golden fish that swam there.J.R.R. Tolkien; Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull (eds.), "Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings", in The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, p. 771
==Etymology==
The Quenya name for "fish" is lingwe (Quenya also has a word for "(small) fish", hala). The Noldorin name, derived from the same Sundocarme is lhimb or lhim, and Doriathrin has líw. (roots KHAL and LIW)
In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens early conceptions of an Elvish language, "fish" is ing, and "young of fish, small fry" is igli., p. 51 A Qenya name for "little fish" (also "Wikipedia:Minnow") is given as nis., p. 20
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Gollum throws a fish called "Xiphiidae" at Aragorn.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)#River Anduin" It becomes Aragorns most dangerous weapon. Xiphiidae are swordfish. Swordfish are saltwater fish, but that matter is overlooked here.
