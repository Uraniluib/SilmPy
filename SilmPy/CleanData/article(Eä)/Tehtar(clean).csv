The Tehtar (Quenya, pron. ; singular Tehta) were a series of signs and symbols used when writing with the Tengwar, consisting of a variety of dots, curls and other marks written above or below Elvish letters.  Most commonly, they were used to represent vowel-sounds, since Tengwar as it was commonly used did not provide characters to represent vowels.  However, some of the tehta were used to abbreviate writing, such as a bar above a consonant that added a preceding nasal of the same TÃ©mar, or a bar below that indicated consonantal doubling, or a downward hook added to the bow the meant a following s (especially favoured in Quenya).
