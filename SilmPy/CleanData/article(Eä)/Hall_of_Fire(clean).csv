The Hall of Fire was a large room in Elronds house in Rivendell.  Between carven pillars in a great hearth a fire was always kept lit, with little other light present.  While the hall stood empty during most days, at night it was given over to the telling of tales and singing of songs.
==History==
In  when Thorin and Company stayed in Rivendell for weeks, Bilbo Baggins undoubtedly visited the Hall of Fire, for in his telling of his adventures he mentioned hearing many songs and tales, and found that the house was perfect for just sitting and thinking.  These words are very close to the description of the hall that Gandalf gave Frodo Baggins as they approached the hall together on 24 October .
On that evening after the feast celebrating Frodos recovery, Elrond and Arwen led their guests to the Hall of Fire.  It was in this room that Frodo found Bilbo, seemingly asleep, but actually composing the Song of Eärendil.  It was also here that Bilbo asked to see the The One Ring and was saddened to see Frodos negative reaction.  The two hobbits then enjoyed talking about the Shire until Aragorn came and helped Bilbo polish his poem.  When Bilbo recited the poem to the crowd Lindir could not tell which parts Bilbo had written and which Aragorn had composed.  Later, when Bilbo and Frodo left, they heard the song, A Elbereth Gilthoniel.
When Samwise Gamgee battled Shelob on 13 March  he recalled the song to 
Varda that he heard in his sleep in the Hall of Fire.  He sang this song and it bolstered his courage, such that he could face down the great spider and force her retreat.
