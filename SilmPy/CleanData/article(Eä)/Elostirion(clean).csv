Elostirion was the tallest and westernmost of the three White Towers that stood on the Tower Hills and that had been built by Gil-galad for Elendil. It held Elostirion-stone of the palantíri of Arnor which did not communicate with the rest but looked only westward across the Sundering Seas to Tol Eressëa. It was the last stone of Arnor until it was removed at the very end of the Third Age.
