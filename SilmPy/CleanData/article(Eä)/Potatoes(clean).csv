Potatoes or taters in Hobbitish, were root vegetables that were apparently among the staple foods of the Hobbits (Hamfast Gamgee was recognized locally as an expert on growing potatoes). Samwise Gamgee expected to find them in Ithilien.
==Etymology==
Wiktionary:potato#English is a word of Spanish and Native American origins. The term Wiktionary:tater#English seen to be used in Hobbitish, represents UK slang.
Since the potatoes are a New World plant (see below), it has been suggested that "potatoes" is perhaps a "translation" from a Westron name of a related but otherwise unrecorded plant of Third Age Middle-earth.
==Inspiration==
Fans have noticed that potatoes are a New World plant, not native to the Old World setting of Middle-earth. The pipe-weed (another New World plant) is referenced as having being brought from NÃºmenor and fans have explored the possibility that this was also the case with potatoes.http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=105560 Forum discussion at LOTRplazahttp://www.thetolkienforum.com/showthread.php?19248-Taters-in-Middle-Earth&s=cc49b7ac8285e2e4b34e52b0e19be48c Forum discussion at the TolkienForum.
