The Two Watchers were two carved figures that guarded the gateway of the Tower of Cirith Ungol with a strange and malevolent will, inhabited by "some dreadful spirits (creatures) of evil vigilance". Each was formed of three bodies - one guarding the way into the tower, one the way out, and the third staring across the gateway itself. Their faces were the faces of vultures, with eyes of black stone. They had the power to block entry to the tower, or escape from it, through the force of their will alone, and were able to send up a shrill alarm call if their guard was breached.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
