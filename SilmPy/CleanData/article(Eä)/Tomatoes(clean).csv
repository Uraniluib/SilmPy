Tomatoes were supposedly a plant known to the Hobbits. 
They were referenced in the first edition of The Hobbit,, p. 34 but J.R.R. Tolkien changed this to "pickles" in the third edition (1966)., note 11, p. 43  The most usual explanation for the change is that the American plant-life would not fit in his setting of ancient Middle-earth.  However, as pointed out by John D. Rateliff, it may have been simply that Tolkien felt that it was too early in the year for tomatoes and substituted a preserved food instead., note 18, p. 18
