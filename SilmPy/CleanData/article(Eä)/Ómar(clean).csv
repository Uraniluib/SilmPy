== Etymology ==
Ómar and Amillo are Qenya names. The former is related to Qenya ōma "voice", while the latter is glossed as "one of the Happy Folk; Hilary", where Hilary derives from Latin hilaris "cheerful". 
The Gnomish equivalents of his names are Ûmor and Gamlos (likely meaning "one who shouts with joy")., p. 13
