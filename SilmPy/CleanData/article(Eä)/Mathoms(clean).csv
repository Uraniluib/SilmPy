File:Robin Wood - Mathom lore.jpg
Mathoms was an old word of the Hobbitish, not recorded as being in use outside the Shire. It was used to refer to "trinkets" or any item that had no particular immediate use. 
Mathoms were many of the presents that passed from hand to hand by the Shire-hobbits - an important part of their culture - and whose owners did not wish to throw them away.
Eventually they were stored in the Mathom-house in Michel Delving.
