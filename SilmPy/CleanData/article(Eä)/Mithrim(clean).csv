Mithrim was a region of Beleriand in Middle-earth, the south-east part of Hithlum. It was the area around Lake Mithrim, surrounded by the Ered Wethrin, and the Mountains of Mithrim, which separated Mithrim from Dor-lómin to the west. Mithrims climate was the same as Hithlums; the air was cool and the winter was cold but it was a fair land. Swans were frequently seen in the pools of the land.
Mithrim was first inhabited by the Elves of Mithrim, and then also by Noldor of Fingolfin and Fingon.
==History==
Some time before the rising of the Moon, Sindar from Beleriand came over Ered Wethrin and settled in Mithrim.
When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth the host of Fëanor camped upon the northern shore of Lake Mithrim. Morgoth sent a host of Orcs through the Ered Wethrin to attack the newcomers and thus upper Mithrim was the scene of the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Noldor met the Elves of Mithrim and learned from them of King Thingol, and tidings of what had transpired during their stay in Valinor.
At the rising of the Sun the host of Fingolfin marched into Mithrim. After approaching Angband Fingolfins host returned to Mithrim and camped upon the northern shore of Lake Mithrim. However, due to the rift between Fingolfins people and the followers of Fëanor, Fingolfin relocated to the southern shores of the lake.
Later in the First Age Mithrim was ruled by Fingolfin, as it formed the most densely populated part of Hithlum. However, after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad Morgoth overran Mithrim and all of Hithlum and afterwards turned the land over to the Swarthy Men.
In the winter of the year of the Nirnaeth Rían gave birth to Tuor in the wilds of Mithrim, where some Grey-elves yet remained. Annael of the Elves who dwelt there in the caves of Androth fostered Tuor after Rían departed Hithlum.
All Beleriand was deluged in the War of Wrath at the end of that Age.
