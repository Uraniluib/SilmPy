==Etymology==
Hareth also appears in Haudh-en-Arwen#Names, the "Ladybarrow", so the name probably means "Lady" in the Haladin tongue.
Robert Foster also suggests that Hareth means "Lady", however the entry erroneously labels the name as Quenya.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Halmirs second daughter, Hiril, was a later addition to the House of Haleth family tree.  Before she was introduced Hareths name was "Hiriel"., footnote, p. 269
