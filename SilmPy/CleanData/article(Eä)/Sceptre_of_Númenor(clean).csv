In Númenor, the power of the Kings and Queens was symbolised not by a crown, but by a Sceptre, held by Elros and all his ruling descendants to the time of Ar-Pharazôn. Among the early Kings, it was normal to voluntarily surrender the Sceptre to an Heir, but this tradition was abandoned in later years. The Lords of Andúnië, the second most powerful nobles on Elenna, also had their own sceptre.
Ar-Pharazôn carried the Sceptre with him when he sailed to attack Blessed Realm, and it was lost with the King and all his armies in the Caves of the Forgotten. In Middle-earth, the exiled Faithful Númenóreans brought with them the Sceptre of Andúnië, and maintained this tradition, as the High King of the Dúnedain held the Sceptre of Annúminas., footnote to the sceptre of Annúminas
