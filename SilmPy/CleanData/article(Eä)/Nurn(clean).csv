Nurn was the name given to the southern regions of Mordor, more fertile than Plateau of Gorgoroth in the north, in which the great inland Sea of Núrnen lay. The people who inhabited Nurn were Men and there may have been prisoners of war there as well. These people were enslaved by Sauron, working the soil around the sea of Nurn to feed Saurons armies.
After the War of the Ring, King Aragorn liberated the peoples of Nurn and gave them the land as their own. The southern region of Nurn probably escaped the destruction caused in northern Mordor by the eruption of Orodruin.
