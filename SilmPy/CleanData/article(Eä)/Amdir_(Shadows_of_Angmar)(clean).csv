Amdir is a character created specifically for The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar. He was a Rangers of the North and part of Aragorns company that helped protect the Hobbits in the Shire and Bree-land during the dawn of the War of the Ring. He managed to free Mundo Sackville-Baggins from the Blackwolds and a Nazg没l. Yet, the Nazg没l stabbed him with his dagger before riding off. Gravely poisoned, he seeks refuged in Archet. 
Perhaps due to the poisoned blade, he joins the forces of Angmar. The Nazg没l that stabbed him along with four others attempts to change him into a wraiths. Aragorn, Lenglinn and Torthann are able to drive off the Nazg没l. Amdir is slain by the Free peoples of Middle-earth before the change is completed. Chapter 1: Unravelling the Thread
