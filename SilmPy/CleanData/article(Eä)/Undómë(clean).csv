Undómë was one of the Elves names for the hour of star-opening at the end of the day: that is, dusk. Undómë was the Quenya name for this time, with the Sindarin equivalent being aduial. There was also a poetic Mannish translation, Evendim (that is, the dim light of evening).  This word is the source of Arwens surname Undómiel, which translates as Evenstar.
