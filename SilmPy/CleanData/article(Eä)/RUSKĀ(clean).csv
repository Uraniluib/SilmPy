__NOTOC__
RUSKĀ is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme given no signification, except from what can be determined from its derivatives., p. 385 (root appearing as "RUSKĀ-")
==Derivatives==
*Kornoldorin: ruska ("brown") > Noldorin: rhosc ("brown")
*Quenya: rusco ("fox")
==Other etymologies==
The related Quenya words russa "red-haired" and russe "(a head or pelt of) red hair" show derivation from another, more basic root *RUS, of which RUSKĀ is obviously an extended form.
==Inspiration==
Tolkien translates the Quenya word russa as "Wikipedia:Russet_(color)" pp.353-354. The English word russet derives from Latin http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/russus russus "reddish".
There is a possibility that the similarities of both form and sense between the Elvish root and English/Latin words is intentional.
