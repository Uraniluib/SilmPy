The Dead Marshes were reeking wetlands that lay north-west of the Dagorlad and south-east of the Emyn Muil.  The marshes were an endless network of pools and soft mires filled with water-courses, and in the dark waters could be seen Dead faces from battles of long ago.
==History==
In the year  the host of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men fought the forces of Mordor in the Battle of Dagorlad.  During the battle on the plains more than half of the Elves of Lothlórien under the command of King Amdír were driven into the Dead Marshes.  After the battle many of the slain were buried outside of the marshy area but over time (in the Third Age) the Marshes had grown and swallowed the graves.

In  King Ondoher of Gondor was caught by a surprise attack by the Wainriders upon the Dagorlad.  When the King and his guard were destroyed many of the confused soldiers of Gondor were driven by the attackers into the Dead Marshes., (i) The Northmen and the Wainriders  However, after Eärnil II won the Battle of the Camp, those of the Wainriders who were not slain in the fight were themselves driven into the Dead Marshes and there perished.
At the Council of Elrond (on 25 October ) Aragorn revealed that he had found and captured Gollum the year before along the skirts of the Dead Marshes.
After Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee had captured Gollum in the Emyn Muil (on 29 March ), he revealed that he had found a hidden way across the Marshes.  The three took Gollum’s passage, where they saw candles and lights dancing about.  Frodo was mesmerized by the lights and tried to reach out and touch the faces of the dead, at the bottom of the marshes.  Gollum told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he had once tried to eat them.
==Inspiration==
In The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien speculated that the description of the Dead Marshes may have been based on his personal experience in World War I, specifically, the Battle of the Somme. When it rained, blast craters in no-mans land would become a series of pools or lakes with bodies of dead soldiers, from both sides, floating in them.
