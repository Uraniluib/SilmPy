The Elvenkings Halls were a cave system in northern Mirkwood, in which King Thranduil and many of the Elves of Mirkwood lived during most of the Third Age and into the Fourth Age.
==Description==
The halls were just inside the eastern border of Mirkwood on the north bank of the Forest River, some miles upstream from Lake-town. The great cave had many passages and wide halls and was more wholesome than the goblin tunnels in the Misty Mountains. While most of the Elves lived in the woods the kings halls served as his palace and treasure vault, and was also a fortress for the Elves in times of danger.
The entryway to the halls had huge stone doors that were closed and secured by magic. The throne room for Thranduil was a great hall with pillars carved from the living rock. In lower levels were cells for prisoners and at the lowest part of the caves were the cellars of the king. These cellars were built over an underground stream so that empty barrels could be dropped into the water and floated out to the Forest River through a gate barred by a portcullis.
==History==
About  the Shadow began to fall upon Mirkwood (causing it to be called Mirkwood). In response, King Thranduil led his people to the north-east corner of the forest and delved there a fortress and series of great halls underground. He was inspired in this enterprise by Thingols halls of Menegroth in Doriath during the First Age, and like Thingol, he used the skill of the Dwarves to aid in making his stronghold, though the Elvenkings Halls of Mirkwood were less grand than that magnificent ancient cavern.

In the autumn of  Thorin and Company were traversing Mirkwood and had run out of food. Spotting some woodland feasts the Company attempted to enter these gatherings but were thwarted each time. On the third attempt Thorin was captured and brought to Thranduils halls where he was interrogated by the king. Angered by Thorins refusal to answer his questions, Thranduil had Thorin locked in his innermost cell.
Soon after, the twelve remaining dwarves (but not Bilbo Baggins) were taken by the Elves and brought to Thranduils halls. They fared no better with the king and were also locked in the kings dungeon. Bilbo though, through the invisibility conferred by the One Ring, roamed about the halls and discovered the cellars and the trap door leading to the underground stream. Through good luck Bilbo was able to obtain the keys to the dwarves cells, free them, and pack them into empty barrels in the cellar. Workers then came and rolled the barrels through the trap door and thus the hobbit (riding one of the barrels) effected the escape of the Company from Thranduils halls.
In , Aragorn captured Gollum in the Dead Marshes and brought him to Thranduils halls. As was told in the Council of Elrond, Gollum was kept in prison but had been allowed to climb a tree, with guards to watch him. About 20 June , Orcs attacked and Gollum disappeared.
During the War of the Ring Thranduils realm had been invaded but on 15 March  he was victorious over the forces of Dol Guldur. With the passing of Sauron Thranduils domain was extended to the Mountains of Mirkwood but presumably he continued to live in the same halls.
