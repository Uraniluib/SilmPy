The Ered Lómin was the grey mountain range that marched north to south between the land of Hithlum to the east and the lands of Lammoth and Nevrast to the west. At its southern end the Ered Lómin met the range of the Ered Wethrin and so walled off Hithlum and its lesser lands from Beleriand to the south. The Ered Lómin was broken by the inlet of the Firth of Drengist.
It was through the Firth of Drengist in these mountains that Fëanor led his followers among the Noldor back into Middle-earth.
The name Ered Lómin means Echoing Mountains, but the origin of the name is uncertain. According to some sources, it refers to the echoes of the great cry of Morgoth as he returned into Middle-earth with Ungoliant before Fëanors own return. According to others, it was merely in the nature of these mountains to produce great echoes. Whatever the origin of the name, it was clearly shared by the land of Dor-lómin, that lay to the south-east of these mountains.
