Ilmen (Quenya, pron. ) was a part of the atmosphere that surrounded the world of Arda, the region of airs where the stars are. 
Flesh cant survive the airs above Ilmen unaided. The Straight Road however traverses Ilmen.
The Moon passed through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down the Chasm of Ilmen on its way back.
==Etymology==
Christopher Tolkien has noted that Ilmen is related to such words as Ilmarë and Ilmarin, entry ilm-.
In the Etymologies, Ilmen is derived from the root GIL signifying "the region above air where stars are"., entry GIL See also men (Elvish)
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the early schematic titled I Vene Kemen, the middle layer of airs was marked as Ilwe (Qenya).
In the Ambarkanta, Ilmen formed the outer layer of normal air, inside Vaiya and it was enclosed between the Mountains of Valinor and the Walls of the Sun mountains beyond the Eastern Sea. Below and inside Ilmen was the inner air, Vista.
Ilmen is the level of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars so it was also called Tinwe-malle (star-street) and Elenarda (disambiguation) (Stellar Kingdom)., pp. 240-1, 242-3, 253, p. 16
