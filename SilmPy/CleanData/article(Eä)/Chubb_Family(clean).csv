The Chubb Family was a family of Shire-hobbits, of whom several were present at Bilbo Baggins Bilbos Farewell Party. Their main connection with the Baggins Family family was through Bilbos grandfather, the Gerontius Took, whose wife Adamanta Chubb was mother to no fewer than twelve children, including Bilbos mother Belladonna Took.
Marriage into the Took and Baggins families, as well as the usage of exotic flower names and jewels, suggest that the Chubbs were of higher class.Jim Allan (ed.), An Introduction to Elvish, pointed out in p. 198
