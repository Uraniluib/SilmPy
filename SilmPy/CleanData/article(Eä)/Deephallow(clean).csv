Deephallow was a village on the Shires eastern border, built on the banks of the River Brandywine, just north to the point where Shirebourn flowed into the river. Immediately across Brandywine was Haysend, the southernmost point of Buckland.
==Etymology==
David Salo suggested that the name represents a speculative Old English form *Deophealh "deep Wiktionary:haugh". A haugh meant first "angle, corner, secluded place" and later "land by a river", consistent to the location of the village near the wedge formed by Brandywine and Shirebourn.
