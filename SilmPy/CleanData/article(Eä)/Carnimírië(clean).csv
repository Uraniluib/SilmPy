Carnimírië was one of the rowans of Fangorn Forest, much beloved by the Ent Quickbeam. It was cut down by Orcs of Isengard, arousing the anger of this impulsive Ent.
==Etymology==
In a letter, J.R.R. Tolkien explained that carnemírie means "with adornment of red jewels" in High-elven (Quenya).  See also caran in the Appendix to The Silmarillion.
