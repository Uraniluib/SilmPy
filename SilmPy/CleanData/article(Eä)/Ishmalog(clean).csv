Ishmalog was the name of a valley in the Second Age wherein the army of the North King fought against the "Fell Folk" of the east. Although the easterners had better weapons the North Kings host was more numerous and they won. The victory had inspired songs sung for generations afterwards. The battle of Ishmalog was also where Buldar of Agar obtained a wound, a sword, and a woman. The woman was a captive and Buldar took her to wife. From their union came Hazad Longbeard and from him came Tal-Elmar (character).
