File:Stefano Baldo - Palantír of Elostirion.jpg)
The Palantír of Elostirion, also known as the Elendil Stone was one of the Palantíri brought by the Faithful from Númenor. 
It was stored in the tower Elostirion on the Emyn Beraid by Elendil, and in later years was guarded by Círdan and the Elves of Lindon.
The stone was aligned westwards towards the Master-stone in the Tower of Avallonë, along the length of the Straight Road; because of this, it could not communicate with the other six of Middle-earth. Only Elendil was able to use it to look west across the Belegaer and see the Undying Lands;  Elendil also tried to see the fallen Númenor with the stone but failed.
Even after the fall of Arnor, Wandering Companies of Elves made pilgrimages to visit the Towers and see the Stone, in order to catch a glimpse of Varda. One such company, led by Gildor just returning from Elostirion, was encountered by Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee and Peregrin Took on 24 September, .
It remained in its tower until the end of the Third Age; it was then taken back into the West aboard the White Ship.
