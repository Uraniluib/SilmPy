Goblin-town was a Orcs#Goblins and Orcs (or Orcs) dwelling which lay under the Misty Mountains, ruled by the Great Goblin.
The main gate of the town was in one of the passes of the Misty Mountains, but as travellers avoided that dangerous road, the goblins opened another under the safer High Pass (the Front Porch). Goblin-town was a series of tunnels and caverns, which went all the way through the mountains, with a "back door" (the Goblin-gate) near the Eagles Eyrie in Rhovanion, which served as a means of escape, and an access to the Wilderland. The cave of Gollum was deep beneath Goblin-town yet was connected to the Goblins tunnels, with one passage leading to the "back door".
In  during the journey to Lonely Mountain, Thorin and Company were captured by the Goblins of Goblin-town. They were brought before the Great Goblin, who accused them of spying, and was enraged when he found that Thorin was carrying Orcrist, a sword the Great Goblin remembered from Gondolin. With the help of Gandalf, the Great Goblin was slain and Bilbo and the Dwarves escaped, pursued by force of Goblins.
