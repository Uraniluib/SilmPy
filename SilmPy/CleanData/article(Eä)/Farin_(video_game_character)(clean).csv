==History==
===Youth===
Farins family originally lived in Lonely Mountain. But after the attack of the Dragons Smaug they went in exile to the Iron Hills, where Farin was born. 
News of the return of Thorin to Erebor reached the Iron Hills when Farin was still very young. Because there was a great need for soldiers, Farin marched in the army of Dáin Ironfoot to Erebor. There he fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, where he proved to be a very strong warrior. For this reason Dáin made him a member of his personal guard.

===Life as Dáins personal guard===
After the battle Erebor was reclaimed by the Dwarves, and Dáin was crowned as King under the Mountain. Farin served him in Lonely Mountain, and fought together with the Bardings against the Orcs and Easterlings. Somewhere after  Bilbo Baggins visited Erebor to meet with his old friends. In this time Farin met Bilbo, and the was very impressed of him. 
When a messenger of Sauron came to Lonely Mountain in  and asked information about "Baggins family" and  "the Shire", Farin was very worried. He though that it was the task of his people to protect Bilbo Baggins and the Shire,  and therefore he did swore an oath that he would travel to that country and protect it. He searched for other companions, but none wanted to travel with him as Erebor was threatened by enemies. Therefore, he went alone after Dáin granted him permission to go.
===War of the Ring===
Farin arrived at the borders of the Shire and protected one of its access roads. He questioned travellers, and sent those who he didnt trust away. The Rangers of the North heard of Farin, and Halbarad tried to resolve this mistery. Halbarad disguised himself as a traveller and gained Farins confidence, who told him about his mission. As Halbarad was convinced that Farins intentions were good, he asked him to join the Rangers in their guard.

Just shortly before the Nazgûl attacked Sarns Ford, he met Andriel, who was surprised to see a Dwarf among the Rangers.
The next morning he assisted, together with Eradan and Andriel, the Rangers while they were attacked by the Nazgûl. They were defeated, and many of the Rangers were slain. However, shortly after the attack the Witch-king met with Agandaûr. Agandaûr tells the Witch-king that he had summoned the Orcs of the Misty Mountains and assembled an army in Fornost. The Witch-king send him back to Fornost, to attack immediately.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue
Halbared sent Eradan, Andriel and Farin to Bree, to warn Aragorn about this news. The three companions meet him in Prancing Pony, and tell him what happened at Sarns Ford. Aragorn immediately sends them Fornost, to stop Agandaûr before he attacks.
In Fornost Farin and his companions, Eradan and Andriel, find a chained Eagle, captured by Orcs and Goblins. After killing his jailers, he introduces himself as Beleram, one of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains. While gathering news for his lord - Gwaihir - he was taken out of the air by siege engines and sorcerers. Farin and his companions make a plan with Beleram to destroy the siege weapons, so Beleram can safely fly over Fornost.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Main Gate 
On the top of Fornosts battlements Farin pushes two siege weapons from the battlements while Beleram atracts the attention of the Orcs and Goblins. The plan succeeds. Furthermore, they kill an Orc Sorcerers and retrieve an unreadable scroll.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Battlements

They team up to kill   Agandaûr.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Outer Wards Although seperating, both groups (with the help of Beleram) eventually reach the citadel of Fornost.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Inner Wards The citadel gate, however, is protected by Magic, and Elladan and Elrohir need all their power and concentration to undo the magical protection. At the same time, a band of Orcs arrives which is succesfully stopped by Farin and his companions.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Citadel Tower
Inside the Citadel tower the group overhears a conservation between Agandaûr and Tharzog, the leader of the Orcs of Mount Gram. The latter informs Agandaûr that intruders have been spotted. Agandaûr commands the Orc to find and kill the intruders immediately, after which Agandaûr leaves. The group attempts to follow him, but is seperated again when Tharzog notices them and closes the gates. Farin, Eradan and Andriel kill Tharzog and his guard.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Citadel Tower
On the top of the Citadel tower they find Agandaûr fighting Elladan and Elrohir. Although he had the upper hand, he is not strong enough to fight Farin, Andriel, Eradan and the twins at the same time. He flees on the back of a Fell Beast. Although Beleram chases Agandaûr, the sorcerer summons a thunderstorm. After being hit by a lightning, Beleram return to the tower. They discuss the events concerning Agandaûr and Fornost, and decide to part: Beleram returns to Gwaihir, the sons of Elrond return to their father in Rivendell and Farin and his companions travel to Sarn Ford to inform Halbarad.
