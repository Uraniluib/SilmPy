"...the proudest of all these birds were the swans", p. 124
Swans were waterfowl of either black or white color, though usually the latter. It said that swans were especially abundant in the Nîn-in-Eilph (Swanfleet), a wetland region in Eriador., "Appendix D: The Port of Lond Daer" (discussion of the name Glanduin)
==Swans and the Free peoples==
The swan was an important bird in the tales of the Elder Days. The Maiar Ossë sent "many strong-winged swans" to draw the ships of the Teleri over Belegaer to Aman without help of the winds. The Teleri (later being called by the epithet the Swanherds) (§30) thus especially came to revere swans, and named their city Alqualondë (the Swanhaven) and built their Swan-ships.

Ossës master Ulmo, the Valar, sent seven great swans to guide Tuor to Vinyamar, where he found a shield which had "an emblem of a white swans wing". Tuor already loved these birds, having been fostered at Mithrim, where swans seem to have been plentiful (and Tuors foster-father, Annael and his folk, had the swan as a symbol). Departing from Vinyamar, Ulmos seven swans approached Tuor and offered him one feather each, which Tuor set in the crest of his helm.
The Teleri were not alone in using the swan-form in ship-building: the prow of Eärendils ship Vingilótë "was fashioned like a swan", , "Song of Eärendil" and the Elves of Lothlórien made a Swan-ships, so well crafted that it resembled a real, giant swan. 
In the Third Age, the symbol of the Swan-knights of Dol Amroth was a banner, silver upon blue, bearing a "token of the Ship and the Silver Swan", and their mariners used swan-prowed ships.
==Names==
In Sindarin, the name for "swan" was alph (pl. eilph), as in Nîn-in-Eilph. The Quenya Wikipedia:Cognate was alqua, as in Alqualondë, and the Telerin was alpa., "Appendix D: The Port of Lond Daer" (Note to discussion of the name Glanduin)
In Tolkiens early tongues Ilkorin and Danian, the name for "swan" was alch and ealc, respectively. (entry ÁLAK) Other early conceptions include Gnomish alfa or alfuil and Qenya alqe., pp. 18-19
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
A late manuscript concerning Númenor tells about the legendary great Swans of Gorbelgod., p. 426
In an early versions of the Legendarium, more details about the use of swans in symbolism and crafting are given:
*Reminding of the Elven Swan-ships, Aulë seems to have been the first to make "great vessels like to the bodies of swans".
*It is also said Tuor used a "boat with a prow fashioned like to the neck of a swan" on Lake Mithrim, and that Ulmo apparently sent three swans to guide him out of Mithrim (much reminding of the later device of the "seven swans"). Later, the wing of a white swan become the symbol for Tuor and his company (House of the Wing) in Gondolin.

==Inspiration==
In a poem about Tom Bombadil, it is said that "he wore in his tall hat a swan-wing feather". J.R.R. Tolkien explained in a letter to Pauline Baynes  that the swan, (traditionally the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan#Role_in_culture property of the King), indicated a "special friendship with Tom", the swans being among the creatures "who looked for the return of their rightful Lord, the true King". Perhaps this perceived nobility of the swans explains why Tolkien used the bird as a symbol for the princely line of Dol Amroth, and why the swans were described as allies of the Ainur and Elves.
A glimpse of Tolkiens childhood experience of swans has also been described: 

==Portrayal in adaptations==
Middle-earth Role Playing:
:Black Swans are conceived as quite ill-meaning creatures "known to mob and overturn boats", and being larger than normal swans. Another type of swans, the Pied Swans (given the name Elph Tithen in Sindarin), are described as "creamy white in color, liberally splotched and speckled with black and grey", and said to be intelligent and friendly to travellers.
