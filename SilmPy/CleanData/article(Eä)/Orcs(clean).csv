Orcs (also called Orcs#Orcs and Goblins) were the footsoldiers of evil overlords - Morgoth, Sauron and Saruman. 
==History==
===Origins and early Years===
The Orcs were bred by Morgoth in mockery of the Elves, sometime during the The Darkness#The Great Darkness.

It is unclear exactly when Orcs were created, but it certainly happened before the War for Sake of the Elves in his stronghold of Utumno. Whether the Orcs were at this time a capable fighting force against the host of Valinor is not known. But at least some of them survived this war, probably hidden in the deep vaults of Angband, and multiplied, waiting for their master.
When Melkor (now known as Morgoth) returned to Middle-earth, he created new hordes of Orcs and invaded Beleriand, where the First Battle of Beleriand took place. Orcs also fought in Dagor-nuin-Giliath.
===First Age===
Orcs appear in the First Age as the core force of Morgoth. Hundreds of thousands of Orcs were bred in Angband to participate in the Battles of Beleriand, which lasted 587 years.
Orcs first appear in the First Age in the Battle of the Lammoth, where they were defeated by Fingolfin and his Noldor. Orcs participated in battles such as  the Dagor Aglareb, Dagor Bragollach, Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Fall of the Falas, and finally in the War of Wrath, where they were almost extinguished. Those that survived the defeat fled eastwards and hid probably in the Mountains of Angmar and the Ered Mithrin.
===Second Age===
Around the year  Sauron reappeared, took the land of Mordor as his realm and started the construction of Barad-dûr. It is likely that most of his servants were Orcs at this time that he had gathered under his command. Still for a long time Saurons foul servants did not play an important role, for the Dark Lord had chosen a more subtle way to overthrow the free people by creating the Rings of Power.
During the War of the Elves and Sauron, in  Orcs formed the main power of Saurons host. Despite the immeasurable number of Orcs, Sauron was defeated by the united hosts of Elves and Númenóreans. Still Sauron was powerful east of the Misty Mountains and the Orcs that inhabited the mountains and the eastern lands multiplied.
The Orcs of the Misty Mountains started a war against the Dwarves, resulting in the First Sack of Gundabad and its occupation by the Orcs. Finally, Orcs were the core force of Sauron during the War of the Last Alliance, and fought in great battles such as the Battle of Dagorlad and the Siege of Barad-dûr.
===Third Age===

During the Third Age, Orcs were the standard troops of the Witch-king of Angmar and Sauron (both in Mordor and in Dol Guldur). 
In Angmar, Orcs fought in the Angmar War. Years later, they invaded Eriador under the leadership of the Necromancer. 
The Orcs of the Misty Mountains, one of the few (more or less) independent Orcish societies, and their leader Azog started out the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, and after their defeat they retreated in their caves. They appeared again in , when the Battle of Five Armies took place.
The Orcs of Mordor fought in major battles during the War of the Ring, such as the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but the majority of Mordors forces were destroyed or scattered at the Battle of the Morannon. Sporadic fighting in the following weeks led to the Orcs finally being driven out of the western end of Mordor, though it is unclear how many Orcs Sauron had in his armies, and it is also unclear how many survived after his defeat. 
The Orcs in Dol Guldur remained in Mirkwood until the Fall of Dol Guldur, one of the last battles of the War of the Ring.
===Fourth Age and beyond===
The fate of the Orcs after the Third Age is unknown. Though many of Saurons Orcs fought on and were slain in the weeks following the Battle of the Morannon, the true number of Saurons hosts is unclear, as are the numbers of Orcs not within Mordor that may still inhabit the rest of Middle-earth. It is at least known that the Orcs of Moria either fled or were slain by the Fourth Age, as it is mentioned that the Dwarves managed to retake Moria and the mines within it.
==Characteristics==
===Culture===
It is certain all Orcs were dependent on the Dark Lord in various ways: after their leader was defeated, the Orcs were confused and dismayed, and easily scattered by their enemies. In the millennia after Morgoths defeat and banishment from Arda, they were without a leader and they degenerated to small, quarrelsome tribes hiding in the Misty Mountains. Only when Sauron returned to power did they begin to reclaim some of their old power. The same happened after Saurons defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men: only when Sauron returned as the Necromancer of Mirkwood did the Orcs become a real danger for Middle-earth again. Orcs were warlike and enjoyed the slaughter of their foes, though many had a cowardly nature and were often regarded as inferior, though far more expendable, than the soldiers of Men, Elves, and Dwarves.
===Lifespan===
It is unknown if the Orcs were immortal like the Elves. There is, in any case, a hint for a long lifespan in the story of two of the most famous Orc-chieftains: Azog and Bolg. Bolg, being the son of Azog, was the chieftain of the Orcs who attacked Erebor in the Battle of Five Armies in . Azog himself was killed in the Battle of Azanulbizar in , so Bolg was at least 150 years old.
===Appearance===
In Tolkiens writing, Orcs are smaller in stature than Men. One "huge orc-chieftain" is "almost Man-high", but others must have been of a similar size to Hobbits (Frodo and Sam succeeded in disguising themselves as Orcs in Mordor). They had long arms and fanged mouths. Some had black skin. Some had short, crooked legs. They had black blood.
===Kinds of Orcs===
The Fellowship usually encountered the large soldier-Orcs bred for war, and sometimes the "snaga" variety which were more geared towards being labourers. Another type is referred to as "snufflers", smaller, black-skinned Orcs with wide nostrils, who excelled in tracking. Despite the smaller size, one snuffler was able to skillfully kill a soldier-orc when they got into a disagreement.

===Orcs and Goblins===
The term goblin was used primarily in The Hobbit but also in The Lord of the Rings where it is used synonymously with "Orc"., p. 24
"Goblin" is an English word, whereas "Orc" is Old English, the language used by Tolkien to represent Rohirric.  Thus, there is no difference between Orcs and Goblins.
The original edition of The Hobbit and early drafts of The Lord of the Rings first used "goblin" everywhere and used "Hobgoblins" for larger, more evil goblins: when goblins were replaced with Orcs Tolkien invented the term Uruk-hai for his more evil Orcs.
==Etymology==
===Orc===
The word Orc is said to be the "form of the name that other races had for this foul people as it was in the Rohirric".
In his late, post-Lord of the Rings writings, Tolkien preferred the spelling Ork. It is also possible that the word is a Common Tongue Version of orch, the Sindarin word for Orc. The original sense of the word seems to be "bogey", "bogeyman", that is, something that provokes fear, as seen in the Quenya cognate urko, pl. urqui.
Tolkien derived the word orc from Old English believing it refers to a kind of evil spirits, which in turn is thought to derive from Latin Orcus "Hades", although Tolkien doubted this etymology.J.R.R. Tolkien, "Letter to Gene Wolfe" (letter) He also thought it survives in the modern language for sea-beasts,, p. 762 such as the Wikipedia:Orca Whale.
Orc is an Old English word that refers mainly to a kind of metal cup (from Latin Urceus).The word Orc occurs twice in Beowulf (poem). However, in a 11th century glossary, this entry was conflated with another entry which refers to evil giants such as Wikipedia:Jötunn and other monsters, also glossed in Latin as Orcus. This merge of the two entries made many philologists of the previous centuries, like Tolkien, to believe that Orc was an actual Old English word that refers to any kind of evil creature from the underworld.Bosworth and Tollers An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (1898), corrected in later editions
The word Orcnéas is once found only in Beowulf (poem) (lines 112-113) and is cited as an example of the word "Orc" in Old English text. Actually its meaning is not clear, and it is thought to refer to corpses (néas) from the Underworld. 
==="Orcs" in Tolkiens languages===
Tolkien said that one of the reason of choosing "Orc" over "Goblin" was the similarity with his fictional languages., pp. 389-91 Indeed most Elvish, Mannish and other words for Orc, are similar to the English word. 
The basic Primitive Quendian Sundocarme, from which the words for Orc derive, is RUKU (said to refer to any "bogey" that scared the Elves):
*Quenya orco (pl. Orkor, p. 12, pp. 74, 194); Exilic Quenya urko (pl. orkor and orqui)
*Sindarin: orch/Orch (pl. yrch/Yrch, class pl. Orchoth/orchothOrchoth is likely a compound of orch + hoth.); glamhoth
*Nandorin: ūriʃ, pp. 52-4
*Adûnaic: urku, urkhu
*Westron: orka, p. 47
*Black Speech: Uruk-hai#Etymology
*Khuzdul: Rukhs (pl. Rakhās), possibly derived from an unknown Avarin word of the same meaningRukhs appears to contain the radical R-Kh-S.
*Drúadan language: gorgûn ("orc-folk"; the form gorgûn is perhaps plural of an unknown singular form), p. 99
In the earliest versions of Qenya, Tolkien had words such as "Ork (orq-) pl. Orqi and fem. "orqindi".
In Noldorin, the earlier version of Sindarin, the word for Orc is the same: orch (pl yrch)., p. 379 (entry for ÓROK), p. 195, p. 217 The Gnomish word for "one of a tribe of the orcs. a goblin" is said to be Gong., p. 41

===Goblin===
Wiktionary:Goblin is a folk word which according to The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English is probably derived from the Anglo-French Wiktionary:gobelin a diminutive of gobel (cf. Wiktionary:kobold). William D.B. Loos notes that goblin is a Romance-derived word, unlike other Germanic words preferred by J.R.R. Tolkien.William D.B. Loos, http://tolkien.slimy.com/tfaq/EnemyMisc.html#Orcs Enemies and Miscellaneous: What was the relationship between Orcs and Goblins? at http://tolkien.slimy.com/tfaq/ The Tolkien Frequently Asked Questions List (accessed 3 July 2011)
==="Goblin" in Tolkiens languages===
In the The Etymologies, the Elvish names used to translate "goblin" derive from root RUKU#Other versions and are:, p. 379 (entry for ÓROK)
*Quenya: orko (pl. orqi)
*Noldorin: orch (pl yrch, archaic yrchy, p. 7)
*Nandorin: urc (pl. yrc)
*Doriathrin: urch (pl. urchin)
In an early linguistic writing, Tolkien translated the Gnomish word Gong as "one of a tribe of the orcs. a goblin.", p. 41
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
===Origin===
According to the oldest "theory" proposed by Tolkien, Orcs were made of "subterranean heat and slime", and their hearts were stones like granite, through the sorcery of Morgoth., p.159 But, Tolkien later changed the legendarium so that Morgoth could no longer produce life on his own.
While Tolkien originally saw all Orcs as descended from tortured Elves, later comments of his indicate, according to Christopher Tolkien in Morgoths Ring ("Myths Transformed, text X"), that he began to feel uncomfortable with the theory that orcs were descending from Elves. However, Tolkien died before he could complete his upheaval of the cosmology, and in the published version of The Silmarillion, the Elf origin of Orcs was adopted.  It does not appear that the elder Tolkien ever decided on a definitive answer. Different origins proposed were: animals that Morgoth infused with reason (Myths Transformed, text VIII), Elves and (later) Men (M.T.,text IX) and "probably" Men (text X).
The origin of Orcs is an open question. In Tolkiens writings, evil is not capable of independent creation, making it unlikely that the Valar Morgoth, who was obviously the first to produce them, could do that ex nihilo. In The Silmarillion is mentioned that the Orcs were transformed from Elves &mdash; the purest form of life on Arda (the Earth) &mdash; by means of torture and mutilation; and this "theory" would then become the most popular. There are hints in the The History of Middle-earth series of books, (especially in Morgoths Ring in the section "Myths Transformed"), that some Orc leaders, such as the First Ages Boldog, or the Great Goblin encountered by Bilbo Baggins and the Dwarves, may in fact have been fallen Maiar which had taken Orc form.
Yet other Orcs may have begun as animals of vaguely humanoid shapes, empowered by the will of the Dark Lord (first Morgoth, later Sauron).
: The Orcs were beasts of humanized shape (&#8230;). (Morgoths Ring, "Myths transformed", text VIII)
==Controversy==
Tolkiens Orcs have been a subject of criticism of racism.  Tolkien described Orcs as  "squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types".
==Other writings==
In The Father Christmas Letters, goblins appear as the enemies of Father Christmas and the Red Elves.
