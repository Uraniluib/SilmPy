Khuzdul, or Dwarvish, was the secret language of the Dwarves.
==History==
Aulë, the creator of the first Dwarves, taught them "the language he had devised for them". Not much is known of the language, as the Dwarves kept it to themselves. One of the only major phrases known to outsiders is their battle-cry: Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! meaning Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!
Khuzdul is unique among languages in that it belongs to a separate language phylum, unrelated to the languages of Elves. On the other hand, there are many similarities between Khuzdul and the native tongues of men, such as Taliska, the language of the first and third houses of the Edain. This is because in the early days of Middle-earth, before Men crossed into Beleriand, they had contact with the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains and in areas further East. Taliska was the ancestor of Adûnaic, the tongue of Númenor and the direct ancestor of the Westron. Both languages displayed Khuzdul influences.
Few of other race have ever succeeded in learning it.
==Etymology==
The word Khuzdul (also spelled Khuzdûl in late manuscripts, p. 321 (footnote 19), pp. 6, 24) is composed of the stem Khazâd, and the adjectival or genitival ending -ul., p. 47
==Other names==
Other names used by J.R.R. Tolkien for the language of the Dwarves include:
*Khazadian, p. 414
*Aulëan, pp. 179, 197
*Nauglian, pp. 197, 277
*Naukarin, pp. 28-9, 81
==Influences==
Khuzdul appears to be structured, like the Semitic languages, around triconsonantal roots, such as kh-z-d, b-n-d, and z-g-l.
The Dwarvish language sounds much like Hebrew, and indeed J.R.R. Tolkien noted some similarities between the Dwarves and  the Jews: both were "at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue&hellip;". Another reason Hebrew was chosen as a basis for Khuzdul is that it is unlike any Indo-European language, and thus sufficiently alien to western ears to show just how different Dwarven speech was from the Elvish languages.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
===Neo-Khuzdul===
For The Lord of the Rings (film series) and The Hobbit (film series), the linguist David Salo used what little is known of Khuzdul to create enough of a language for use in the movies. This is usually referred to as neo-Khuzdul by Tolkienists. Gimli says the Neo-Khuzdul insult, Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul, (commonly translated "I spit on your grave!") to Haldir in the extended edition of Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Salo did not provide this phrase, and it didnt fit easily into his neo-Khuzdul. When the scriptwriter for The Hobbit (film series) asked him about it with the idea of having Thorin use the same curse, Salo reverse-engineered Gimlis line into a neo-Khuzdul phrase îsh kakhfê ai-‘d-dûr-rugnul meaning "May my excrement be poured upon the naked-jawed (ones)".
