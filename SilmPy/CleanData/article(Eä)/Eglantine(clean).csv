Eglantine is a type of wild Roses. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee found it growing in Ithilien as they journeyed through that land. Eglantine Banks, a Hobbit lass, was named after it, so it probably grew in the Shire as well.
==Etymology==
The name is used for the sweetbriar. It derives from French referring to the "dog rose", ultimately from Latin aculeus "spine".
