The Pass of Aglon (or just Aglon), also called the Gorge of Aglon, was the pass between Dorthonion and the uplands west of Himring, to the north-east of Beleriand.
It was about six leagues in length, with the western side bordering the Dorthonion Plateau rising in very high steep walls. It was chilly since a bitter wind continuously blew through the pass from the lands to the north.
==History==
Two of the Sons of Fëanor, Celegorm and Curufin, heavily fortified this area, augmented by extra forces in Himlad. About ten leagues to the east, the pairs elder brother Maedhros had built upon the Hill of Himring his stronghold, thus protecting this weak point in the chain of kingdoms created by the Noldor after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle-under-Stars).
In  during the Dagor Bragollach Orcs broke through Celegorm and Curufins fortifications, leaving Maedhros stronghold the centre for re-grouping of Fëanors sons. They later took back the Pass. However, after Nirnaeth Arnoediad in  the Sons of Fëanor were scattered, the Pass of Aglon fell under Morgoths domination, and it was garrisoned by Orcs. The Pass was never recovered, along with all of the land of northern Beleriand.
==Etymology==
