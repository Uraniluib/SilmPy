Lagduf (late Third Age) was an Orcs soldier who served under Shagrat in the garrison of the Tower of Cirith Ungol. During the War of the Ring, a riot broke out in the Tower with a rival band of orcs from Minas Morgul. Lagduf attempted to escape with another Orc named Muzgash, but they were both shot as they ran from the fortress.

: Though unidentified, a trio of Uruk-hai are encountered by Samwise Gamgee on the stairs of the tower after the battle. Since only one Uruk (Snaga (Orc of Mordor)) was encountered by Sam on the stairs in the novel, it is likely that the other two are meant to be Lagduf and Muzgash.
