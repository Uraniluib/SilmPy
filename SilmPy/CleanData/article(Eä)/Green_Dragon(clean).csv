__NOTOC__
The Green Dragon was one of the many inns of the Shire. It was located in Bywater on the Bywater Road and was the building nearest to Hobbiton, being one mile south-east from the bridge over the Water that led to Bag End. As such, Hobbits from both villages could be seen there.
==History==
In  when Bilbo Baggins looked at the letter that Thorin Oakenshield had left on his mantelpiece after the Unexpected Party, he found that he only had ten minutes to arrive punctually for the 11 a.m. start of the quest to the Lonely Mountain at the Green Dragon Inn. Bilbo made it, barely, and found that the Thorin and Company were packed and ready to go.
On 12 April , the same day that Gandalf returned to the Shire after many years, Samwise Gamgee was visiting the Green Dragon when the talk turned to Tree-men, one of whom had been seen by Sams Halfast Gamgee. Although queer tales had begun to be heard in the Shire the hobbits at the inn, especially Ted Sandyman, laughed at Sams story.
When Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, and Sam returned to Bywater on 2 November  they found the Green Dragon closed with broken windows and a half dozen Ruffians loitering nearby. When they insulted Frodo the other three hobbits drove the men away.
After the Ruffians and Saruman had either been killed or driven away the Green Dragon Inn was undoubtedly restored.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the original version of Thorins letter to Bilbo, the rendezvous point for the start of the journey to the Lonely Mountain was the Old Mill., p. 89  Not long before the story was published this was changed to the inn, first named the Green Man and finally the Green Dragon., note 2, p. 98
