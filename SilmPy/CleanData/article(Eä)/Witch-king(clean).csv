The Witch-king of Angmar was the chief of the Nazgûl, King of Angmar and Sauron’s great captain in his wars.  A Wraiths, the Witch-king of Angmar was nearly indestructible, a terrifying warrior, and a cunning strategist.
==History==
Some time after Sauron seized the Rings of Power in the Sack of Eregion,  he gave Nine Rings to Men kings, sorcerers and other warriors., p. 289  With the power of their rings, the Nine achieved glory and grew wealthy, but they eventually started hating life as they were slowly drawn under Sauron’s dominion. In the end, they all became the dreadful Nazgûl.
The one later known as the Witch-king was one of these, likely one of the unnamed three lords of Númenor to take the rings., p. 267, Ballantine Books p. 320 The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 20  He first appeared in the histories as a Ringwraith in .  Being the most powerful of the Nazgûl, he became their chief and the most feared servant of his master Sauron.
When Mordor fell in , the Nazgûl vanished into the shadows and were not heard of again for a long time.
===Early Power in Angmar===
More than a thousand years later, in c.  of the Third Age, Sauron began to rebuild his power in Dol Guldur.  In c.  his Nazgûl also reappeared and the Witch-king established his realm, Angmar, in the north.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix B  His capital was Carn Dûm, on the northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains.  He summoned men, orcs and other creatures of evil inclination to his banner.  No one knew that he was actually a servant of the long-dormant Sauron and few that he was a wraith.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin p. 320 
In the north, disunity plagued the Dúnedain of Arnor. They had divided into three kingdoms: Cardolan, Rhudaur and Arthedain, and were constantly at war with one another.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin p. 320   The Witch-king saw the North-kingdom of Arnor as more vulnerable than the South-kingdom of Gondor.The Peoples of Middle-earth, The Heirs of Elendil, entry for Malvegil, HarperCollins p. 193-194   He played upon their opposition, sending in infiltrators and taking over the hearts of the men of that land.  By , the government of Rhudaur was controlled by men secretly in his service,The Peoples of Middle-earth, The Heirs of Elendil, entry for Malvegil, HarperCollins p. 193-194 and he secretly aided them in their wars against the other kingdoms.The Peoples of Middle-earth, The Heirs of Elendil, entry for Argeleb I, HarperCollins p. 194  He then struck at a time of great hostility among the three, in .  Rhudaur in the east fell first, and most of the Dúnedain there were hunted down and slaughtered by sorcerers.The Peoples of Middle-earth, The Heirs of Elendil, entry for Arveleg I, HarperCollins p. 194   Cardolan was ravaged and the Tower of Amon Sûl, held by the men of Arthedain, was placed under siege.  King Arveleg I was slain and the tower was destroyed, but the coveted Amon Sûl-stone escaped in the hands of the surviving men of Arthedain and was brought to Fornost.Unfinished Tales, The Palantíri, note 16, Houghton Mifflin p. 413 
The Witch-king continued to press the men of Arthedain, laying siege to Fornost, and he might have taken over all of Arnor in that one offensive.  But Araphor, the 18-year-old son of Arveleg, came to leadership and, with the help of the ancient elf Círdan of Lindon, repelled the Witch-king’s forces at Fornost and the North Downs.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin pp. 321-322  Elrond brought an army of Elves from Rivendell and Lothlórien, and the Witch-king was pushed back and subdued.
===Twilight of Angmar===
The Witch-king sat silent in Carn Dûm, rebuilding his armies and preparing for a final assault on Arthedain, last of the Arnorian kingdoms.  The Dark Plague came and went in , taking with it the last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan.  The Witch-king sent barrow-wights to inhabit the barrows in Barrow-downs.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin pp. 321-322 In , he felt that his power was sufficiently restored to begin the advance.
His attack was sudden, but not unexpected.  King Arvedui sent a message to King Eärnil II of Gondor the year before, but help did not arrive in time.  Fornost fell, and the Witch-king took up residence there in the palace.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332  Arvedui held out as best as he might on the North Downs, but at last fled north with the treasured palantíri of Amon Sûl-stone and Annúminas-stone.  He would not return, for he perished in a shipwreck in .  With him the palantíri were lost forever in the icy seas of Forod.  The already-diminished North-kingdom ended, and Arnor fell.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin pp. 321-322
Meanwhile, a coalition in the south had formed.  Eärnil sent his son, Eärnur, north with a great fleet, all that Gondor could spare. They arrived at Lindon and joined with the folk of Círdan.  Círdan summoned all that would come: surviving Dúnedain of Arnor and elves of Lindon.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332  Even a company of Hobbits archers went to their aide.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iii), Houghton Mifflin pp. 321-322  The Witch-king had grown overconfident and, instead of staying behind his fortifications, initiated the attack.  The Battle of Fornost was fought on the plain between Nenuial and the North Downs. The Witch-king may not have anticipated the strength brought against him, but for whatever reason the alliance gained the upper hand. His army began to fall back toward Fornost, but Eärnur’s magnificent horsemen struck from the north and the Witch-king was routed.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332 
He decided to flee to Angmar and the safety of Carn Dûm, but the cavalry, with Eärnur himself in the lead, overtook him.  Moreover, the ranks of the allies swelled, as an army of elves from Rivendell came led by the mighty hero of old, Glorfindel.  Angmar was purged of men and orcs, and all seemed lost for the Witch-king in the face of such numbers. But the Witch-king himself came at the last, robed and masked in black and riding a black horse, and attempted to kill Eärnur with his own hands.  But Eärnur’s horse shied away and fled, and the Witch-king laughed.  But Glorfindel came on his white horse, and faced with such power the Witch-king fled.  He vanished into the shadows and no-one marked where he had gone.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332
Eärnur wanted to pursue, but Glorfindel held him back and made his famous prophecy.

===Lord of Minas Morgul===
The Witch-king escaped to Mordor, and gathered the other Ringwraiths about him in .The Lord of the Rings, Appendix B  Angmar and Carn Dûm were lost, and so in  the Witch-king began a two-year siege of Minas Ithil, eventually capturing the place and turning it into his residence.  It was renamed Minas Morgul, and the Ithil-stone was sent to Sauron.  The Witch-king sent an aura of fear in Gondor, and much of Ithilien was deserted.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332
Eärnur succeeded his father as King of Gondor, and still held the Witch-king in especial hostility due to his humiliation at the Battle of Fornost.  The year of his coronation the Witch-king sent him a taunting challenge, but Mardil the steward restrained Eärnur from rash action.  Seven years later the challenge was repeated, and Eärnur rode with a small escort to Minas Morgul.  None that rode thither ever returned, and there was no longer a King in Gondor.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin pp. 331-332
After this the Witch-king bided his time.  He and the Nazgûl built up their armies, including the terrible new orc-race of uruks.  In  he sent them out to capture Osgiliath, which they did successfully.  They were driven out by Boromir (Steward of Gondor), Ruling Steward of Gondor, but Osgiliath now lay completely in ruins.  Boromir went on to retake Ithilien, so that even the Witch-king feared him.  But he was killed by a Morgul-wound, and so his rule was but twelve years.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (iv), Houghton Mifflin p. 333
===Hunt for the Ring===
Sauron declared himself openly in , and sent three of his Ringwraiths to Dol Guldur (though the Witch-king was left in Minas Morgul).  Then, by lucky chance, the creature Gollum was captured and interrogated.  Under torture, the wretched creature revealed the tale of the One Ring and how it came to be in his possession.  But from his words Sauron misunderstod that the land of the hobbits who stole the Ring was on the banks of the Gladden River, whence Gollum originally came from., Houghton Mifflin p. 338-341 Sauron sent the Nine, under the leadership of the Witch-king, invisible and uncloaked, to search for the Ring after the assault of Osgiliath.
Khamûl, the Witch-king’s lieutenant, reported that he was unable to find the “the Shire” in the vales of Anduin.  The Witch-king was determined to search north and west until Gollum was found, or the Shire.  But plans were halted when Sauron received word of the prophecy in Gondor and the doings of the turncoat Saruman, and concluded that the Wise did not yet have possession of the Ring.  He sent the Ringwraiths to Isengard in the form of Nazgûl, too late to prevent the escape of the captured wizard Gandalf, but had words with Saruman.  Saruman, already a traitor to both sides due to his transparent lust for the Ring, fortified himself in Isengard.  The Witch-king did not have enough power with him to assault Saruman in his great fortress, but had words with him.  Saruman convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring was, and so the Nine passed into Rohan in search of him.
They came upon the traitor called Gríma and questioned him.  The terrified man told them everything he knew; that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them.  The Witch-king spared Wormtongue’s life, foreseeing that Wormtongue would bring ruin to Saruman.  He divided his wraiths into four pairs, and went with the swiftest to Minhiriath.  Along the way they captured several spies of Saruman, and found to their delight charts and maps of the Shire.  They sent along the spy to Bree, warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Saruman.
They came to Sarn Ford, but the Dúnedain Rangers of the North prevented them from crossing.  They sent for their great captain, the chieftain Aragorn, who alone could well resist the wraiths, but he was away, and the Ringwraiths captured the ford and killed many of the Rangers. The Witch-king sent three Ringwraiths under Khamûl into the Shire while he went east with the others.  But they had come too late: the Ring had moved on in the hands of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins.
===Pursuit of the Ring===
File:Ted Nasmith - Fire on Weathertop.jpg - Fire on WeathertopKhamûl was unsuccessful, but brought word from the spy they had spared in Bree.  The man had witnessed a vanishing act on Frodos part, and had organized an attack on the inn.  The Witch-king guessed that Frodo would head east, and sent four wraiths to Weathertop, the ruins of the tower he had destroyed long ago.  He went south along the Greenway and discovered nothing.  Gandalf followed them, but the Witch-king let him slip ahead, and attacked him on Weathertop.  Gandalf escaped at dawn, and again the Witch-king divided his force and sent four after the wizard.
The Ring walked almost right into his hands.  The captain of the Dúnedain, Aragorn II, had become the guide of the hobbits, and led them to Weathertop, where they were spotted and attacked.  The Witch-king advanced on Frodo, and the terrified hobbit put on the Ring, seeing them as they truly were.  When Frodo resisted, and invoked the name of Varda, the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder. The tip of his blade broke off and sent poison through the hobbit’s veins.  Then Aragorn counterattacked with flaming brands.  The Witch-king departed with the other Nazgûl, believing that his objective was completed.
He resumed the pursuit quickly, though, and found that Khamûl had been driven from the Last Bridge by his old enemy Glorfindel.  The Witch-king, who only had one companion with him, was likewise unable to confront him openly.  They regrouped and went south, rejoining with the other four.  They managed to pick up the trail of the company of the Ring, and despite hindrance from Glorfindel and Aragorn managed to pursue Frodo alone on Asfaloth.  The pursuit came to the Ford of Bruinen, and there Frodo compelled the horse to stop.  The Witch-king saw his defiance and laughed, breaking his sword with a movement of his hand.  But the waters of the Bruinen rose at Elronds command, sweeping the Nine downstream.The Fellowship of the Ring, Flight to the Ford
===War of the Ring===
File:Angus McBride - Gandalf facing Witch-king.gif - Gandalf facing the Witch-king
The Witch-king took the only surviving horse back to Mordor, arriving there in December.  He then sent aid to the other eight Nazgûl, and they returned in secret.  In Minas Morgul they prepared for a grand invasion of Gondor at the order of their master.  The Witch-king was given by Sauron added "demonic" force.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 210, p. 272  On 10 March , the signal was given and Minas Morgul was emptied.  The Witch-king rode at the head of the army in black, upon a black horse, as he had in the time of the wars of Angmar.  As the Witch-king passed out of the gates of the dead city, he sensed the presence of Frodo.  He was disturbed, but continued on through Ithilien.
With the Witch-king in command, Osgiliath soon fell. The defeat was attributed to his superior numbers, and his terrible presence which made all hearts to quail.  The Rammas Echor was breached, and the Pelennor Fields were overrun.  Other wraiths he sent out mounted on Fell beasts.  Faramir, Ruling Steward Denethors son, was wounded by a dart and the Black Breath, but his company was saved by a sortie.  Then the Witch-king laid siege to Minas Tirith itself, sending fire and the heads of the dead Gondorians into the city via catapults.  Then he launched the assault.
He sent Grond (battering ram) out first, accompanying it in person so as to be the first to enter the city.  Three times Grond struck the gate, empowered by the sorcery of the Witch-king.  The third time the Gate shattered in a flash of fire.  The Witch-king passed into Minas Tirith, but was confronted by Gandalf on Shadowfax.  Gandalf forbade him entry, but the Witch-king laughed and put on a show of power.

===The Fall of the Witch-king===
File:Nick Deligaris - Éowyn and Nazgûl.jpg
As Gandalf stood resolute before the Witch-king, the Rohirrim arrived. Thus he departed, mounting a fell beast and descending upon King Théoden who led the attack.  Snowmane, the Kings horse, collapsed with a dart in the side, and Théoden was crushed beneath him.  But the rider Dernhelm defied the Witch-king.  The Witch-king threatened Dernhelm with a terrible death, but the rider revealed that she was a woman, Éowyn, and the Witch-king remembered the words of Glorfindel. He hesitated, but then moved forward. Éowyn decapitated the fell beast, but the Witch-king rose and struck her down with his mace, breaking her shield-arm. Then the hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck stabbed him in the sinew of his leg with the Daggers of Westernesse (though there was much pain in Meriadocs arm afterward), as he drew back to kill the woman.  Then Éowyn rose and drove her sword through where his invisible head was, and the sword broke as his crown toppled.  The Witch-king gave a great and horrible wail, perishing at last.
So the prophecy of Glorfindel was fulfilled, for the Witch-king did not fall at the hands of a man, but at the hands of Éowyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck.  With his defeat, and the coming of Aragorn II in the black ships, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields was lost by Sauron.
==Names==
* Witch-king of Angmar - "Witch" most likely coming from his background in sorcery, and "king" after his establishment of the realm of Angmar in 1300.
* Witch-lord of Angmar - A variant of the above title.
* Lord of the Nazgûl
* Lord of the Ringwraiths
* Chieftain of the Ringwraiths
* Lord of the Nine Riders
* King of the Nine Riders
* Wraith-lord
* Wraith-king
* High Nazgûl

* Morgul-lord
* King of Minas Morgul
* Black Captain
* Captain of Despair
* Dwimmerlaik
* Lord of Carrion
==Etymology==
While in modern English witch has mostly female connotations, referring to a hag or sorceress, in middle-English wicche had no gender distinction; the preference of witch for female persons (the males referred more usually as wizzards) evolved later through the centuries. 
Tolkien uses the archaic, gender-unspecific meaning of the term; of course, the word Wizards refers exclusively to the Maiar Istari.
==Inspirations==
An undead witch-king named Þráinn appears in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrómundar_saga_Gripssonar Hrómundar saga Gripssonar. It is possible that this was Tolkiens source of inspiration.
The prophecy that the Witch-king would fall "not by the hand of man" and the fulfillment of the prophecy occurring as a technicality (being slain by a hobbit and a woman) bears a striking resemblance to the prophecy regarding the title characters death in Shakespeares Macbeth, where it was foretold that Macbeth will be slain "not by man born of woman" and is then killed by Macduff, born by caesarian section. Tolkien was familiar with the play, having reputedly taken inspiration for the Last March of the Ents from the same source (See article Ents for details).
==Portrayal in adaptations == 
The Witch-kings true name is never given, and therefore among Tolkien fandom, the Witch-king is often simply called Angmar, after the name of the realm he founded and led. It is possible that he was one of the three Black Númenóreans Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly Isilmo, a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. This possibility was adopted by the now defunct Middle-earth Role Playing game and Mithril Miniatures where he is named Er-Murazor, a Númenórean prince and younger son of Tar-Ciryatan.

===Films===
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:The Witch-king is shown with no distinction from the other Nazgûl; all are robed in brown and black, and none seem to be able to talk clearly.
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:The Witch-king is portrayed as a humanoid figure with no head. Red eyes glare under a golden crown. His dialogue is more or less as in the books, albeit in a strange and somewhat unfitting electronic voice. After a stab from behind by Meriadoc Brandybuck, Éowyn beheads him. It is worthy of note that the Witch-king is seen with the Red Eye of Barad-dûr as his emblem and faction, rather than the grim moon of Minas Morgul. 
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:The Witch-king is called the "Witch-king of Angmar", the "Lord of the Nazgûl", and the "Greatest of the Nine" by Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King; however, no other mention of the kingdom of Angmar itself is made. Also, in that film, there is no mention of Glorfindels prophecy; there is only a claim among the enemy that "no man can kill" the Witch-king.  Like the other Nazgûl, he is depicted as a humanoid figure shrouded in a hooded black robe; his only distinguishing feature is a mask-like spiked helmet with a huge mouth. His first mention is when Gandalf tells Peregrin Took while in Minas Tirith that the Dark Lord has not yet revealed his "deadliest" servant: the Witch-king, the one that "stabbed Frodo Baggins on Weathertop". 
:During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Witch-kings army uses the ram Grond (battering ram) to break through the city gates early in the battle (after the failure of a lesser ram), and the Witch-king is not present to confront Gandalf as he is in the book. The confrontation takes place later, as Pippin and Gandalf race to the tombs to save Faramir, and the Witch-king intercepts them. Unlike in the book, this meeting decisively favors the Witch-king, who breaks Gandalfs staff and throws the wizard to the ground before leaving to deal with the arrival of the Rohirrim.  Gandalfs face shows obvious fear in this scene, in comparison to the resolution (for "victory or death") in the books.
:The Witch-kings final stand on the battlefield occurs with less dialogue than in the book, and the weapons used to defeat him are both mundane: Merrys sword is not a Daggers of Westernesse from the Barrow-downs, but rather the Rohirric sword that Théoden had as a child. This does makes it somewhat confusing in the film wether or not the Witch-King was truly destroyed in this fight like in the book, or wether we was temporarily incompacitated (like at the ford of Bruinen) and later perished along with his other fellow Nazgul due to the One Rings destruction.
:Eight actors are known to have played some part of the Witch-king. 
# An unidentified extra portrayed the "King of Men" in the prologue. He was chosen to be the Witch-king simply because he was the smallest of the nine.
# Shane Rangi did the horse chase. 
# Fran Walsh provided the "Ringwraith scream".
# Effects technician Ben Price played the Witch-king in "many scenes"http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/07/072904lotrwetaprops.html
# Brent McIntyre is officially credited as the Witch-king in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He stabbed Frodo.
# Lawrence Makoare filled the robe of the Witch-king in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.
# Mark Ferguson filled the heavy armoured costume when Makoare felt claustrophobic.http://www.markferguson.net/articles/interview_Nautilus20.html
# Andy Serkis provided the voice of the Witch-king in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:The Witch-king is mentioned to have been defeated years ago, and his body sealed by the "Men of the North" in a very deep and dark tomb in the "High Fells of Rhudaur". His wraith, apparently summoned by the Sauron#Saurons Return, is encountered by Radagast in the ruins of Dol Guldur, but the Wizards fends him off and salvages the Witch-kings Morgul-knife in the struggle.
:In the Attack on Dol Guldur, The Witch-King, along with the other Nazgûl, participates by fighting Saruman and Elrond, members of the White Council. In the end, he and the other Nine are driven Mordor by Galadriel and her Phial of Galadriel, Sauron also eventually following suit.
===Radio series===
1956: The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series):
:The Black Captain is played by Felix Felton.Radio Times, Volume 133, No. 1727, 14 December, 1956
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:The role of The Lord of the Nazgul, as he is always credited in this production, is expanded with material from The Hunt for the Ring. He is the second speaking character in the series: he is the one who captures Gollum, though he is not identified as such until the credits. Philip Voss provided the voice for The Lord of the Nazgul.
===Games===
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:The Witch-king is shown without distinction of the other Nazgûl.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game):
:The Witch-kings role and voice are similar to that of the film, but his appearance is different. An early helmet design, that had been removed from the film because it resembled Saurons helm too much, was used here, presumably because there was no time to make a new character model.
2004: The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring:
:Witch-King is one the main "Hero" units for the Servants of Sauron, his signature ability is being able to turn Wights into Nazgûl. The evil campaign storyline shows him reclaiming Dol Guldur for Sauron.
2004: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth:
:Witch-King is a "Hero" unit for Mordor faction. He is an airborne unit riding on a Fell Beast and one of the strongest units in the game.

:In addition to his appearance from the first game, the Witch-King can now also dismount and become a landscape unit armed with a mace. 
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The Witch-king is a non-playable character present in several scenes. His most memorable appearance takes place in the Great Barrow within the Barrow-Downs. There are also multiple references to him in quest dialogue, the most notable is that the Witch-King for whatever reason cannot return to rule Carn Dum and instead has erected a Steward named Mordirith to rule in his place, in mockery of the Stewards of Gondor.
2009: The Lord of the Rings: Conquest:
:In the campaign for the "Evil" side, the Witch-King is revived by other Nazgûl after Sauron reclaims The One Ring.
2011: The Lord of the Rings: War in the North:
:The Witch-king appears in a flashback of the playable characters during the prologue of the game. He and the other Nazgûl attack and destroy the Rangers of the North camp at Sarn Ford. Shortly after he speaks with Agandaûr, who explains that he has assembled an army in Fornost. The Witch-king commands him to return and attack immediately, to aid in the Hunt of the Ring.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue
