Laurelin () was the Golden Tree of Aman, the female mate of Telperion, and the younger of the Two Trees of Valinor. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was collected by Varda.
==History==
Laurelin was created by the Valar Yavanna and Nienna on the hill of Ezellohar where she shed their light on the realm of the Valar in the long years before the making of the Sun and Moon. Laurelin, the youngest of the two, flowered second and bloomed during the latter part of each Valian day.

She was destroyed by Morgoth who used the giant spider spirit Ungoliant to his evil purpose during the theft of the Silmarils, which caused the Darkening of Valinor. Through the power of Nienna and Yavanna, though, Laurelin produced a single fiery fruit before she died. This golden fire was set in a vessel made by Aulë and his people, and steered into the sky by the Maiar Arien, making the Sun.
