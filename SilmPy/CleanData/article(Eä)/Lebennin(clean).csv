Lebennin (prounounced  ) was a region and fiefdom in southern Gondor south of the Ered Nimrais between the Gilrain and the Anduin.
Known as Fair Lebennin of the Five Streams, referring to the Five Rivers of Lebennin, it was one of the faithful fiefs of Gondor. Its largest city was Pelargir.
Lebennin was largely populated by Men of mixed blood, as many Men of Lebennin traced their ancestry to the forgotten Men of the Mountains that had been displaced from the White Mountains by the Númenor.
During the War of the Ring, Lebennin did not send many Men to the aid of Minas Tirith as it was under attack by the Corsairs of Umbar. Lebennin was rescued by Aragorn and the Oathbreakers of Dunharrow.

:For game development purposes, Lebennin was divided into Lower Lebennin and Upper Lebennin, divided by Pelargir and the river Sirith. Lower Lebennin was the eastern-most area in Central Gondor and Upper Lebennin was the western-most area in Eastern Gondor. Dor-en-Ernil lay to the west across the river Gilrain and Lossarnach lay to the east across the river Erui. The emblem of Lebennin was five wavy blue lines representing the Five Rivers of Lebennin on a white field. Aside from Pelargir, major settlements in Lebennin included "Ost Anglebed", "Glaniath", and Tumladen (Gondor), along with Linhir which was also part of Dor-en-Ernil. The smaller settlements, some of which had fallen to enemy forces before the breaking of the Siege of Gondor, included "Ethilorn", "Sarnhad", "Malbarth", "Aerthir", "Lornost", "Erynos", and "Halach". A local tradition in Lebennin was the offering of gift baskets to the rivers in honor of the Five Sisters of Lebennin, though by the end of the Third Age few believed the Sisters were any more than a myth.
