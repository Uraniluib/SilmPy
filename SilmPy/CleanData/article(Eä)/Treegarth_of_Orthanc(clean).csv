The Treegarth of Orthanc was the name of the forest established around the tower of Orthanc in the valley of Nan Curunír following the Ents victory at the Battle of Isengard.
==History==
Shortly before Gandalf, Théoden and company departed Isengard on 5 March , Treebeard declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the "Watchwood".; 
However when Gandalf and company returned on 22 August  Treebeard welcomed them to the "Treegarth of Orthanc". The Ents had destroyed the Ring of Isengard and filled the land with orchards and trees. A stream ran into a clear lake, in the middle of which stood Orthanc the impregnable tower.; 
Following the reunification of Arnor and Gondor, Aragorn granted the Ents complete self-governance of the Treegarth of Orthanc within the Reunited Kingdom.
