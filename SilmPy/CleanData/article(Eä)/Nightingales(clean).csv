Nightingales were small brown birds of thrushes kind, famous for their clear singing and for the fact that they would sing at night as well as during the day (hence their name).
The Maia Melian was said to always have nightingales about her, and she taught them their songs. It was the song of these birds that enchanted Elwë, lord of the Teleri, when he was wandering alone in Nan Elmoth and came upon Melian.
