Tulkas was a Valar. He was the most warlike of the Valar and the spouse of Nessa.
==Attributes==
Tulkas was so strong and quick that he needed no weapon or steed. He delighted in deeds of prowess and strength such as wrestling and fighting. But he was not dreadful; he laughed loudly in sport and war and his anger dispelled darkness and clouds. 
He was a hardy friend and slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive.
He was however mindless and did not learn from the past; always quick in action, he was not good in counselling., p. 206 §7
His flesh was ruddy and his hair and beard golden.
==History==
Tulkas was the last of the Ainur to descend into Arda, 1499 Valian Years after the arrival of the other Ainur. He heard of their First War with Melkor and came to them from the far heavens. But for his arrival, the Dark Lord might have defeated the Valar.  Hearing the sound of Tulkas laughter and beholding his wrath, Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda was begun. 
After the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their first dwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had come.

When at last the Elves awoke, the Valar took council regarding the matter of Melkor. At length it was decided that, for the sake of the Elves, the Valar should regain guardianship of the world and remove Melkor. Tulkas was glad of this decision. In the War for the Sake of the Elves, after a long siege at Utumno, it was Tulkas who wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face. Tulkas bound Melkor with the enchanted chain Angainor, forged by Aulë. For a while the world was free from Melkors influence.
When Melkor repented of his actions and was pardoned by Manwë, Tulkas was disappointed with this decision, ever distrustful of Melkor. But having fought Melkor in the name of authority, he could not rebel himself, and accepted Manwës decision.
Tulkas also tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he urged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of Valinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the Silmarils. Tulkas and Oromë searched in vain for Melkor, unable to penetrate the unlight cast by Ungoliant.
It is said that in the Dagor Dagorath, Tulkas will once more oppose Melkor, and will directly fight him in the battle and play a large role in his defeat. The victor is unknown, as it will be supposedly by the hand of Túrin that Melkor is slain once and for all., p. 333
