Gethron, like Grithnir, had been young at the time of Hador, when they had roamed far and wide throughout Beleriand. 
In their old age, they remained in the service of the House of Hador, whose lord at that time was Hadors grandson Húrin. After Húrin failed to return from the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, his wife Morwen chose Gethron and Grithnir as guides for the young Túrin, to lead him out of the now dangerous land of Dor-lómin. It was Gethron who stood before Thingol in the halls of Menegroth and asked that Túrin be fostered by the King, so playing a small part in Turins deadly fate.
