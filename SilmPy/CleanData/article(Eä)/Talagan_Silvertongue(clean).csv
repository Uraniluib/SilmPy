Talagan Silvertongue was the lord of the Edhelion. In c.  2500 an alliance of Goblins and Dourhands attacked Edhelion to gain its relics under the leadership of Skorgrím Dourhand. Talagan sent messengers to Elrond of Rivendell for aid. Just before Elronds forces arrived, the Dourhands managed to break through Edhelions defences and surrounded Talagan. In a last attempt to save Edhelions relics Talagan destroys the entrance of the halls. The stones crush both Talagan and Skorgrím Dourhand.The Lord of the Rings Online, Ered Luin Introduction, Instance: The Refuge of Edhelion
