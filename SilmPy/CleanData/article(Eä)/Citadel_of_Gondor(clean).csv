File:Ted Nasmith - At the Court of the Fountain.jpg - At the Court of the FountainCitadel of Gondor was a term sometimes used loosely of Minas Tirith in Gondor, but in fact strictly referring to the fortified seventh and highest circle of that city.
It was the citys strongest point, surrounded by high walls and battlements on the keel. One reached the Citadel through the Seventh Gate, manned by the Guards of the Citadel.
The Citadel housed the Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith), the Tower of Ecthelion and its court with the White Tree of Gondor.  There were also the Kings House, lodgings for the Steward, Merethrond, barracks for the Guard, and other buildings for guests and other workers.
