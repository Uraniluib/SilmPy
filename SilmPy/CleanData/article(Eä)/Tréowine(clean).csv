 
Tréowine, son of Céolwulf, was a close friend of Ælfwine.
==History==
Around the year http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/915 915 AD, in autumn, the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes Danes attacked http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porlock Porlock. They were at first driven off and Ælfwines company managed to capture a Danish http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr cnearr at night. At dawn Ælfwine told to his closest friend, Tréowine, he intended to sail off westward, perhaps to the country of the legendary king http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceafa Sheaf. Tréowine agreed to accompany him at least as far as to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland Ireland. They got two other companions: Ceola of Somerset and Geraint of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Wales West Wales.
Many days after they passed Ireland the voyagers were exhausted. A "dreamlike death" seemed to come over them, and soon they passed out. The last that is known of the journey is that Tréowine saw the world plunge down under them, while sailing the Straight Road.
