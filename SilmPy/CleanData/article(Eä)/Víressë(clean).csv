Víressë was the name for the month of the year (asta) that followed the month Súlimë and preceded the month Lótessë. It was the fourth month in the Kings Reckoning and the Stewards Reckoning; in the latter calendar, it was preceded by the feast-day of Tuilérë. After the introduction of New Reckoning, Víressë became the first month.
Víressë in the Kings Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards Reckoning) corresponded to Astron in the Shire Calendar (approximately modern 23 March through 21 April).
==Etymology==
This Quenya name is related to words such as virya "fresh" and perhaps derives from an Elvish root having to do with freshness or youth. Víressë was the Quenya name inherited from Númenor and traditionally used by the Westron-speaking peoples. The Dúnedain themselves however used the Sindarin name of the month, Gwirith.
==Inspiration==
As the Númenorean calendars seem to be based on the Wikipedia:French Republican Calendar, the name and meaning of the month corresponds to the month Wikipedia:Germinal_(French_Republican_Calendar), meaning "seed-time"., Elvish loanwords in Indo-European, p. 151
