The River Narog was the chief river of West Beleriand, the largest tributary of River Sirion.
The Narog was eighty leagues in length.  It rose from the Pools of Ivrin in the Ered Wethrin, flowed south and then southeast, flowing through a gorge in a series of rapids where it crossed the hills of the Andram or Long Wall, finally meeting Sirion in the Land of Willows Nan-tathren, not far above the Mouths of Sirion.  Narogs tributaries were the River Ginglith in the north and the River Ringwil in the Taur-en-Faroth.
Into its western bank, just south of where Ringwil rushed into Narog, was carved the city of Nargothrond, stronghold of Finrod.
== Etymology ==
In the The Etymologies, the rivers name was stated to mean "rushing, violent". However, in a later writing by J.R.R. Tolkien, the Sindarin name Narog was given two possible Khuzdul origins: Nar√¢g and naruka, both of unknown meaning., pp. 37, 47
In Eriols Old English translations, Narog is referred as Hlyda "Loudy". The Elves of Nargothrond were named Hlydingas.
