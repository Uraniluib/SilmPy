Erellont was one of the three mariners who accompanied Eärendil and Elwing to Aman, the other two being Aerandir and Falathar.
J.R.R. Tolkien never specified the race of the three mariners: while it has been suggested that they were Men,http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/aerandir.html Aerandir at http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.asp Encyclopedia of Arda (accessed 6 April 2011) others argue that they were Elves.http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=347256&page=73 War of the Silmarils (game forum thread; accessed 6 April 2011)
==Etymology==
The meaning of Erellont is unknown. It has been speculated that the name means "lonely (star) ship" in Sindarin,In that case derived from ereb (+ êl) + a possible derivative of LUT. or that the name is "possibly a dialectal Sindarin of the Falas" or even a "combination of Mannish and Elvish".http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/26202 Erellont - name etymology (message 26202; August 2, 2003) at Elfling (cf. replies)
