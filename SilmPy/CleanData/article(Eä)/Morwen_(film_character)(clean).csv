Morwen is a character invented specifically for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. She is played by Robyn Malcolm. 
==History==
Morwen was the mother of Freda and Éothain (film character),  whom she sent to alert Théoden that the Dunlendings were pillaging through Rohan. Her children were kept at Edoras until Théoden led his people to shelter at Helms Deep, where the children were reunited with their mother.
==Etymology==
The name Morwen is unusual for the Rohirrim, being Sindarin and not Old English. Movie producers reasoned that this Elvish name would become popular in Rohan after the coming of Morwen Steelsheen, the Gondorians queen consort of Thengel.
