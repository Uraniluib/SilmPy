1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:One of the Nazgûl (possibly the Witch-king, for he carries a mace) is shown riding a fell beast. However, Bakshis film only covers events up to the Battle of the Hornburg, so this is the last seen of the fell beasts and their riders.
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:The Nazgûl ride winged horses. In the confrontation of Éowyn and the Witch-king, the latter rode a plump black-grey dragon-like animal. 
1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
: The Fell Beasts are said to likely be "distant relatives of ancient Cold-drakes", and "grow to lengths of 30 feet (with 30-35-foot wingspans)". In the middle Third Age they live in mountainous areas of Mirkwood, presumably because of the Sauron#Saurons Returns presence at Dol Guldur. They are used as steeds by both the Nazgûl and a few Olog-hai warlords.In the supplement, Creatures of Middle-earth (2nd edition), the Fell beasts are said to be "presumably bred from Winged-drakes" and to have a body between 15-25 feet and a wingspan between 30-40 feet.
1995-8: Middle-earth Collectible Card Game:
:Fell Beast increases the number of strikes of one Nazgûl hazard-creature. Wild Fell Beast is a Drake which attacks with three strikes. With the card Fell Rider the Ringwraith may move to a non-Darkhaven site (without allies and followers). 
2001-3: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:The fell beasts are depicted as more Dragons-like and serpentine, i.e., their heads appear more like a snakes and they do not have beaks. This depiction came largely from John Howes influence.
:In the films, the fell beasts are used for attack much more often than in the books, with the Nazgûl usually swooping down and screeching, making the defenders at the gate of Minas Tirith run away, leaving Gandalf alone to face the Witch-king as he enters.
:Although on screen the films never make this mistake, sometimes cast or crew members (Lawrence Makoare and Richard Taylor most notably) on the commentary tracks and the documentaries refer to the fell beasts as Nazgûl; this is incorrect. The fell beasts are the creature that the nine Nazgûl ride, and the mistake probably arose because fell beasts are always seen with a Nazgûl atop them.
2001-: The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game:
:The Fell Beasts are portrayed without beaks, reminiscent of the depiction in The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy.http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/productDetail.jsp?prodId=prod480006a&amp;_requestid=1321389 Winged Nazgûl at http://www.games-workshop.com/ Games-workshop.com (accessed 10 June 2011)
2002-5: The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game:
:Hell-hawks, employed as mounts by the Ringwraiths and found wild in southern Mirkwood and (after the War of the Ring) in Gondor, resemble a "cross between lizards and featherless birds". They were bred by Sauron in mockery of the Eagles., pp. 30-31
2011: The Lord of the Rings: War in the North:
:Agandaûr has several Fell beasts under his control. At the end of Chapter 1, Agandaûr flees on the back of one of them.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Citadel Tower
