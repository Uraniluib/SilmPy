Gondor Sindarin, page 100 was a dialect of Sindarin spoken by the Gondorians of Gondor. 
==Differences==
Westron was the first language of Gondor. The nobility usually learned Sindarin, and used it to be polite to other nobles and strangers alike. Because it was both an acquired and a learned language, it had some notable differences with "regular" Third Age Sindarin. 
===Phonetical===
Like any acquired language, the second languages sound range is directly influenced by the speakers original sound range. Westron did not possess ch, note 49 or y, and pronounced them differently.
The y was pronounced by Sindarin Elves as wikipedia:International Phonetic Alphabet y, a wikipedia:Close front rounded vowel. Of all languages, only Sindarin had this sound, so it was problematic for speakers of other tongues. Gondorians generally pronounced it as an i, though it was sometimes substituted with an e, as in the Gondorian plural for onod, ened (rather than the usual enyd).
Also frequent in Sindarin was the ch, the wikipedia:velar fricative, which the Gondorians also encountered among pre-Númenórean placenames such as Erech and Eilenach., note 51
The most notable use of the voiceless velar fricative was in the name of Gondors new northern neighbour, Rohan. Originally envisioned as Rochand, in Gondor this became Rohan. Though Rohirric did possess the voiced ch, it adopted the southern use. The voiced velar fricative, found in Rochand, was pronounced as a sounded h, while the voiceless variant, at the end of words, was pronounced as a k. Those very learned would pronounced them correct, but forcibly so.
===Philological===
Another notable difference from regular Sindarin was purely wikipedia:Philology. Those Gondorians learned in lore wished to speak like Noldor, and the Sindarin they spoke in the First Age was North Sindarin. At least one feature from North Sindarin was reintroduced: whereas "true Sindarin of the Elves" changed both the voiced and voiceless combination of a wikipedia:sonorant and a wikipedia:Fricative consonant to a long sonorant, the Gondor Sindarin retained the spirant. Thus in the case of the former, malt ("gold") and orn ("tree") became Mallorn, in Gondor this remained Malthorn., pages 5-31, esp. 27Carl F.
