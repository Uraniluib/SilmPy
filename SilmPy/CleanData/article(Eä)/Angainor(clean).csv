Angainor was the chain used to contain Morgoth (who was later known as Morgoth) in the Halls of Mandos. It was constructed by the Valar AulÃ« and held Melkor for three ages (around 2,900 solar years). At the end of the First Age, Melkor was again bound by Angainor, and his iron crown was made into a collar.
==Etymology==
