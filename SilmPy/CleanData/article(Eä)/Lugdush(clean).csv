Lugdush was an Orcs, and apparently an Uruk-hai, in the service of Saruman. He was a member of Uglúks raiding band that captured Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took beneath Amon Hen, and drove them westwards to the eaves of Fangorn Forest. It was there that Lugdush met his end, at the hands of Éomers Rohirrim.File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Lugdush.jpg
==Etymology==
Its possible that his name contains the Orcish element lug- ("fortress, lock-up, prison", p. 79) seen in the name for the Dark Tower, Lugburz., p. 241
