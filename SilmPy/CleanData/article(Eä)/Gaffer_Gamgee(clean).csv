 
Hamfast Gamgee, better known as the Gaffer, was a Hobbits of the Shire, and the father of Samwise Gamgee.
==History==
Hamfast was born in 2926, the third son of Hobson, who was a roper by trade.
He entered the service of his relative, Holman Greenhand, and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of Bag End. On 22 June, , he and Holman tried frantically to keep the garden in order during the auction of the presumed-dead Bilbo Baggins. It is likely that at this time he already lived at Number 3, Bagshot Row.
Hamfast became a gardener in his own right in about , p. 187, and a local expert on potatoes. He married Bell Gamgee, and they had six children: Hamson Gamgee, Halfred Gamgee, Daisy Gamgee, May Gamgee, Samwise and Marigold Gamgee. Sam became Hamfasts apprentice.
Sam took over most of his fathers work, who had become too old for the laborous work. He became known as the "Gaffer", a name Sam uses more often than "Hamfast".
Prior to the Bilbos Farewell Party, the Gaffer entertained a crowd at the Ivy Bush. Always a man of loquacity and knowledge, he argued with Sandyman, Old Noakes and Hams neighbor Daddy Twofoot about the Baggins Family and the Sackville-Baggins Family.
On 22 September, , the night of the departure of Frodo Baggins and Sam from the Shire, Khamûl, one of the Nazgûl rode up the lane, and asked the elderly hobbit about "Baggins Family". A week later, he was visited by Gandalf who also informed about Frodos whereabouts.
When Lotho Sackville-Baggins and eventually Sharkey took over the Shire, the Gaffer was evicted from Bagshot Row. After the Battle of Bywater, in which he only had a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored New Row, while Sam moved into Bag End. He was looked after by the Widow Rumble, and died in Fourth Age 7.
His son, Sam, named his seventh child Hamfast Gardner after his father.
==Etymology==
The name Hamfast means "Stay-at-home", or literally, "Home-fast". It is a translation of his Westron name, Ranugad Galbasi. In the Kings Letter, the name (referring to Hamfast Gardner, not the Gaffer) is translated into Sindarin as Baravorn. 
"Wiktionary:gaffer" is a colloquial word for "old man".
==Inspiration==
In Letter 257, J.R.R. Tolkien recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930s. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Gamgee. This "curious local character" was "an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer. 
 
Tolkien had several encounters with actual Gamgees, however. wikipedia:Gamgee Tissue, a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after wikipedia:Sampson Gamgee (1828-1886), a famous Birmingham surgeon, whilst in the Black Country dialect cotton wool was referred to as "gamgee". The Gamgees were notorious surgeons - years later, Dr. Leonard Gamgee tended those war-wounded, including Lieutenant Tolkien.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:John Church plays Gaffer Gamgee. He used a thick peasant accent for the role.  He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Nazgul.  He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Hobbits for wearing "ironmongery."

2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Gaffer appears in the films The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition), where he is played by Norman Forsey.

2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Dragon, but during the night, he informs Frodo of the Ringwraith that stalks the Shire. He was voiced by an uncredited Jim Piddock.
