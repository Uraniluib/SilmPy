:Smaug is named "Slag", the Ancient Monster.
1977: The Hobbit (1977 film):
:Smaug was voiced by American actor Richard Boone. In this version, Smaug is broadly similar in size and colour but his shape is less elongated due to being more weighty. Smaugs face is rounder, possessing more mammalian traits - resembling a mix between a cat and a bat - having bat-like ears and fur around the face and down the back. Also, his armour is never mentioned to be strengthened by lying on the treasure, but more resembles an extra padding of skin/scales, minus the bare patch.
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Smaug is a wikipedia:Computer-generated imagery-motion capture creature produced by Weta Digital, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. He is shown with no front legs but walking on the wrists of his wings.

2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Smaug makes his full appearance in the second part. In his conversation with Bilbo Baggins, he shows an awareness of the One Ring and Sauron, as well as the nearby presence of Thorin and Company. It is also observed by Bilbo that the Lake-mens legend of Girion having loosened and removed a scale from the Dragons breast was in fact true. When the Dwarves enter the mountain, Smaug chases them, finally catching up to them in the forges, where the Dwarves stage a Battle of the Forges, tricking Smaug into relighting the forges with his fire. They manage to cover Smaug in hot molten gold, but he sheds it off without difficulty. Smaug leaves them and flies off to Lake-town to seek revenge for what he perceives to be their part in Bilbo and the Dwarves attack.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:After destroying the majority of Lake-town, Smaug sees Bard attempting to take him on. He taunts the bowman, and, then, while charging him, Bard shoots his Black Arrow into the Fire-drakess vulnerable spot. While in the throes of death, Smaug flies up into the sky, where he takes his last breath and then falls to his watery grave in Long Lake (taking the Master of Lake-town in his boat with him along the way).

Here he found and defiled a First Age Adan holy place, destroying tombs and stealing a modest amount of treasure. Smaug was upset by his lack of wealth. Therefore when he heard the tale of the Dwarves of Erebor he knew that the great treasure should be his.
