The Three Rings were magical artifacts, three of the Rings of Power. They were forged by Celebrimbor and his smiths with the desire of "understanding, making, and healing" and granted the power to preserve all things unstained. They were named Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal elements of air, fire, and water (respectively). 
Whereas the other Rings of Power gave the power to control and conquer, and Wraith-world, the Three were different. Sauron did not assist in their making nor ever did he touch them, and his taint was not directly upon them. But, as they were created according to the craft taught by him, they would fall under the power of the One Ring.
==Names and descriptions of the Three Rings==
* Nenya, The Ring of Water, also called the Ring of Adamant, made of mithril with a shimmering white stone; it was the chief of the Three, p. 251 originally worn by Celebrimbor himself but given to Galadriel
* Narya, The Ring of Fire, set with a ruby; originally worn by Gil-galad, then by Círdan, who finally gave it to Gandalf.
* Vilya, The Ring of Air and mightiest of the Three, gold with a sapphire stone; originally worn by Gil-galad but given to Elrond.
The Rings were named after the three principal elements, each matching the color of their stones. Their names also match the fates of the three Silmarils.Maglor threw one into the sea, Maedhros fell with one in the lava, while Earendil keeps one in the sky. However not much is known about their specific powers and whether they had anything to do with each element.
==History==
After "Annatar" taught and assisted the Gwaith-i-Mirdain with creating the Rings of Power, he left Eregion. Celebrimbors smiths proceeded then to forge Three more on their own with the knowledge already gained from him. Their forging was completed by around . Annatar didnt learn about them, and they were "unsullied", free from Saurons corrupting influence.
When Sauron created the One Ring, the Elves who wore the Rings of Power heard his voice and realized they had been deceived. Celebrimbor then sent his three rings away for safekeeping: He gave Nenya to Galadriel in Lothlórien, who advised him to send the other two west away from Sauron, so he gave Vilya and Narya to High King of the Noldor Gil-galad in Lindon.
As the Elves failed him, Sauron War of the Elves and Sauron against Eregion and succeeded in claiming the Rings of Power. But the Three remained outside his grasp and their whereabouts were seldom revealed. 
After Saurons defeat in the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, the Keepers of the Three Rings were free to wear them. During the Third Age, the Rings were not idle., Elronds words to Gloin They were used to create enclaves of peace and protection where memory and beauty were preserved from wear and decay. 
During the War of the Ring Frodo Baggins found out that Galadriel held Nenya, using it to preserve Lothlórien from withering, and Aragorn reprimanded him for revealing this. The other two rings were revealed at the end of the Third Age, after Frodo destroyed the One Ring, and the Dark Lord Sauron was completely overthrown. It transpired that Elrond had wielded Vilya and presumably used its powers to keep Rivendell a haven safe from attack. It was Gandalf who wielded Narya, given to him by Círdan., p.389 
After the destruction of the One Ring, their power diminished and became plain relics. Not being able to hold back Time and preserve the High-elven lore and beauty, their bearers, in the Last Riding of the Keepers, left Middle-earth on the White Ship. The Third Age ended and the Dominion of Men began.
