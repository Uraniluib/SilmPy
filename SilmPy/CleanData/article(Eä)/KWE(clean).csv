KWE is an Elvish etymological base that expresses concepts of articulate speech and (subsequently) an eloquent being, a person.
==KWENE==
KWENE is an extension of KWE, Quendi and Eldar p. 391-392, the basis for the concept of "person", beings capable of articulate speech, hence "persons" as opposed to animals lacking any form of language. and specifically an Elf, since the Elves were the first speakers who defined themselves.

*Quenya: Quendë (Calaquendi, Moriquendi, Vanyarin > Quenya), quen (aiquen, roquen)
*Telerin: Pendi (Calapendi, Moripendi), pen (aipen, arpen, ilpen)

The older The Etymologies give the root as KWEN-ED, simply meaning "Elf" without other semantic varieties.
