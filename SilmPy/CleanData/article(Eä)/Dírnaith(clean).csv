The Dírnaith, also known by its Quenya name Nernehta, means man-spearhead.  It was a wedge formation launched over a short distance against an enemy massing but not yet arrayed, or against a defensive formation on open ground.  It was designed by the Númenóreans for rapid attack against an opposing force before it could properly array itself for battle and it relied on the great strength and Stature of the Númenóreans., note 16
