File:Jeff Reitz - Annúminas-stone.jpg - Palantír of Annúminas
Stone of Annúminas was one of the three palantíri of Arnor, the North-kingdom of the Dúnedain. Though it was counted one of the lesser of the seven Seeing-stones brought into Middle-earth, it was nonetheless the one used most often by the King in the north, and was preserved at Annúminas through the history of the realms of Arnor and its successor Arthedain. 
When Angmars forces overran Arthedain, its last King, Arvedui, saved the Stone of Annúminas, along with the palantír that had been kept in the Tower of Weathertop. With these and other heirlooms, he fled into the far north, where he was given shelter by the Lossoth, the Snowmen of Forochel of the north. At last a ship from the Grey Havens came to rescue Arvedui, but after he had boarded, its hull was crushed by the ice, and all aboard were lost. The Stone of Annúminas, along with that of Amon Sûl, were lost in the shipwreck, and sank beneath the cold waters of the Icebay of Forochel.

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The Annúminas-stone was used by Mordirith in Carn Dûm to communicate with Sauron. It was never explained how it came into his possession. While in battle with the Ranger Golodir, the palantír is stolen by Amarthiel. She brings it to Barad Gularan and communicates with Sauron that she is now the Steward of Angmar. 
:She brings the palantír back to Annúminas and locates her lesser ring, Narchuil. The Rangers of Evendim are able to take the palantír away from her. They eventually bring it to Elrond in Rivendell.
