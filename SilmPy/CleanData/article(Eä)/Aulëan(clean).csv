Aulëan is the language phylum of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves. It is there contrasted with Oromëan, the language phylum of the Elvish languages such as Qenya, Kornoldorin and Ilkorin. Aulëan was named from the Khuzdul tradition that it had been devised by Aulë the Smith, the Valar who created the Dwarves.
This concept was later dropped, although the published The Silmarillion mentions that Aule started teaching the seven Fathers of the Dwarves before Ilúvatar scolded him.
