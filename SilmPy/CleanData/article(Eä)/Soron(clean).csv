==Etymology==
This word derives from the Primitive Quendian þoronō, p. 426-7 from the Sundocarme THORON "eagle", an extension of the root THOR "come swooping down"., THOR In the development of Quenya words from Common Eldarin, a short vowel that follows another vowel of the same quality was lost, p. 426-7, so that primitive þoronō developed into þorno and then sorno.
