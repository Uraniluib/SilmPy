Harry Goatleaf was a Men of Bree and a member of the Goatleaf Family. He worked as the keeper of the West-gate of Bree in the great hedge that surrounded the township of Bree.
As such, he was the first of the Men (Big Folk) encountered by Frodo Baggins and his companions on their travels during the War of the Ring - he greeted them gruffly on their arrival at the town. He was later present in the Prancing Pony doing suspicious actions, as it was later discovered he was under the power of the Nazgûl.
Some months after the hobbits departure, Harry, together with Bill Ferny, joined with a band of brigands from the south, causing trouble that left five of the Bree-landers dead. After that, he left Bree with other ruffians, presumably to join Ruffians in the Shire.
