In early stage of the legendarium, Falasquil (the "beach of peace"), p. 24 was a  name given by the Noldoli to Tuor dwelling place near Mithrim. The floor of the cove was white sand; the walls were embellished by Tuor with animals, birds, trees and flowers. His favourite carving was a swan, which eventually became the emblem of his house. Tuor dwelt there for a while, until Ulmo appointed him with the mission to reach Gondolin., pp. 151-2
