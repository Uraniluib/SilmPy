Ruling Steward was the title used for the rulers of Gondor after the loss of its King.
The Stewards of Gondor were only the advisors to the Kings of Gondor. The first Ruling Steward was Pelendur who ruled briefly after the death of King Ondoher and his sons (). 
Mardil was the one who started ruling Gondor after the death of its last King Earnur. The Ruling Stewards ruled on the behalf of the King until the throne would be claimed by one of the Royal House. The office was in all respects and purposes that of the King, although out of respect the Steward never sat on the throne of the King; instead, they sat on a simple chair of black stone placed below it. The symbol of their office was a white rod. 
The title was hereditary, and was carried on through twenty-six generations to Denethor, Ruling Steward at the time of the War of the Ring. His son Faramir gave up the rule of Gondor to Aragorn, the rightful Heir of Isildur. Faramir then took up the traditional role of a Steward of Gondor as the advisor to the King.
