King of the West was a title taken by Aragorn on his accession to the throne of Gondor, signifying his Kingship over all the Free peoples of the West, from the north to the south.
In both the Arnor and Gondor of the DÃºnedain, there had been no King for many centuries. At the time of Aragorns coronation, there had been no Kings of Gondor for 969 years,, 2050 and no King of a united Arnor for 2,158 years., 861 The last King to rule both realms jointly had been Aragorns distant ancestor Isildur, though his Kingship was cut short at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields before he could truly take up the rule of his twin realms.
From that time, when the Third Age was just two years old, the West had had no uniting King. At the coronation of Aragorn, two years from the Ages end, Arnor and Gondor were at last united once again, and Aragorns rule of the West is therefore referred to as the Reunited Kingdom.
