Root *B-R-K
It is possible that "baruk" is also a genitive case, meaning "axes of " rather than just "axes". The phrase "baruk Khazâd" can be compared to a "construct pair" in Semitic languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic.Magnus Åberg, http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html Mellonath Daeron: An analysis of Dwarvish, as of 6 September 2010
