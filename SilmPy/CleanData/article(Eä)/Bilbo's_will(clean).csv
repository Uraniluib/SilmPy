Bilbos will was the legal document whereby Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins heir, came into possession of Bag End instead of the Sackville-Baggins Family after Bilbos disappearance.  It was legally sound and included the signatures of seven witnesses in red ink, in accordance with Hobbits customs.
 
==History==
By the time of Bilbos Farewell Party, the Sackville-Baggins, especially Otho Sackville-Baggins and Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, had been coveting Bag End for sixty years.  Bilbo forestalled them by creating a will that would transfer ownership of the valuable property to his cousin Frodo Baggins.  On the day after the party (23 September) Otho and Lobelia came to Bag End and demanded to see the will.  Otho read the will but could find no fault, and stumped off in disgust.
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When he wrote the fifth version of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien included the information that Otho was a lawyer and that BingoBingo Bolger-Baggins later became Frodo Baggins. would legally enter into ownership at midnight on 23 September.
