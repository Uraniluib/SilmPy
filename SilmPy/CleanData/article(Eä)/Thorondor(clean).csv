Thorondor, the Lord of the Eagles, was the greatest of the Eagles of Manwë king of the Valar. It is said that Thorondor had a wingspan of thirty Wikipedia:Fathom., pp. 102-3 (also p. 173)
==History==
Thorondor was sent by Manwë to watch over the Noldor after they arrived in Beleriand. The Eldar first encountered him when he helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment from Thangorodrim. 
After that, Thorondor and the rest of the Eagles settled in the Crissaegrim. When Gondolin was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Fingolfins body from defilement after Morgoth killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face. 
He and two of his vassals, Gwaihir and Landroval, p. 68 rescued Beren and Lúthien when Angband was aroused. When Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors. 
During the War of Wrath, Thorondor and Eärendil led the Eagles in battle with the Dragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black. 
Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath,Tolkien fandom have suggested that Thorondor perhaps returned to Valinor. Cf http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=181775 Thorondor at http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum.php LotRPlaza.com. but his descendants played part in some events of the Third Age.
