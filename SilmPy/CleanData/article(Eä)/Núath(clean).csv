The Woods of Núath was a wooded area in the north of Beleriand.Because the woods do not appear in the published The Silmarillion, they were left off the map of Beleriand. The name does appear in the map provided in The Children of Húrin. It was bordered in the west by the hills lying north-west in West Beleriand south of the Ered Wethrin, and in the east by Eithel Ivrin, the source of Narog. The river Ginglith began in it., note 14
When Voronwë led Túor eastward to go to Gondolin they passed through the Woods of Núath. The journey was through bitter winds and took weeks to accomplish.
