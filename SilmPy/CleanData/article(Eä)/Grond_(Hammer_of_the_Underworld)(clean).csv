Grond, called the Hammer of the Underworld, was Morgoths mighty mace that he bore when he fought Fingolfin before the doors of Angband.  Each time Grond struck the ground it shook the land like a bolt of thunder, creating pits from which smoke and fire erupted.  However, Fingolfin evaded these lumbering strokes like a flash of lightning; he only fell when he grew weary and Morgoth was able to crush him under his shield. Much later during the Third Age Sauron constructed a great battering ram, also called "Grond (battering ram)", designed solely to crush through the mighty gates of Minas Tirith. Named after his former masters weapon, this ram, powered by the Witch-king, broke the city gates in four strokes.
