The Hidden Half is the name given to all the parts of Arda below the edge of the world, where all that existed were the Martalmar, the foundations of the earth, as well as the lowermost regions of the Vaiya and the airs of Ilmen. The Pelóri and Walls of the Sun prevented anyone from finding the Hidden Half of the world. pp. 242 - 243
Vaiya, that flows completely around the world, forms a sea below it, and it seems like the world "floats" on that sea. Ulmo the Lord of Waters dwells in Vaiya, below the Martalmar.
