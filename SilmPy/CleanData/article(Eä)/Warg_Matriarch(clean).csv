The Warg Matriarch was a Gundabad Wargs and the steed of Azog in the The Hobbit (film series). She is portrayed as a giant white warg, and according to the creators of the films, she is the mother of the other Gundabad wargs seen in films. She and Azog are shown to get along quite well, as Azog can be seen stroking her in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and feeding her in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.
==History==
The first appearance of the Warg Matriarch was when Yazneg and Fimbul return to Weathertop to report their failure in capturing Thorin and Company. Azog rides her in all three The Hobbit films, and she even accompanies her master to Dol Guldur. She is last seen when Azog is leading an orc army towards Lonely Mountain. It is unclear if she survives the Battle of Five Armies or not.
