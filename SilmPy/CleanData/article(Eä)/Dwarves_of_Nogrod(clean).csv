The Dwarves of Nogrod were the Dwarves House who dwelled at  Nogrod in the First Age.
==History==
During the Years of the Trees the western Fathers of the Dwarves awoke from beneath Dolmed creating the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.
They were initially friendly to the Elves of Beleriand, renowned as craftsmen and jewelers, such as Gamil Zirak whose works were to be found in the treasuries of King Thingol of Doriath,, The Departure of TÃºrin and Telchar known for the forging of weapons. Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, perhaps also those of Nogrod, aided the Noldor in the building of Nargothrond.
Dwarves of Nogrod, as well as their kinsmen of Belegost, participated in the Union of Maedhros supplying them with soldiers and weapons.
Some craftsmen from Nogrod stayed in Menegroth and were asked by King Thingol of Doriath to set the Silmaril in the Nauglamir. But they coveted the Nauglamir they made and killed Thingol in his treasury, and fled, only to be slaughtered by the avenging Elves who killed all but two. The survivors returned to Nogrod, and lied to their kinsmen saying that Thingol refused to pay the craftsmen and for their work and killed them. 
Although the Dwarves of Belegost refused to aid them, they formed a great host which passed over Sarn Athrad intimidating the Sindar who fled before them. In the Battle of the Thousand Caves they ravaged the Caves and Thingols treasures. But on their return home they were hunted down by Beren and killed by his army of Green-elves and a group of Ents at the Battle of Sarn Athrad as they were crossing the river.
Nogrod was ruined due to the War of Wrath by the Valar which marked the end of the First Age.  Most of the Dwarves of Nogrod would later go to Moria.
