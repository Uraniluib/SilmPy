Dwaling was a village in the far Northern parts of the Eastfarthing of the Shire, just north of the hills of Scary.
 
==Etymology==
In a note to translators, Tolkien said that Dwaling was a regular toponymic formation of a settlements name, "the descendants of Dwale". Dwale would be a nick-name of one particular Hobbit, and the name was derived from Old English dwale, "dull".J.R.R. Tolkien, Undated note part of Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings, cited in Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull (2008), The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page lviii This name has been connected to Dwalak≈çneis, the Gothic translation of Tolkiens own name.Mark T. Hooker, A Tolkienian Mathomium, pp. 49-52
Formerly, before the publication of the abovementioned note, David Salo had suggested it is a form of "dwelling", from Old English dwellan stop, stay, tarry.
