Barahirs Outlaw Band was a group of survivors of the sack of Dorthonion who remained loyal to the exiled Barahir, Lord of Ladros. They numbered ten, plus Barahir and his son Beren. They were betrayed by Gorlim, one of their number, in the year .
==History==
During the Dagor Bragollach, in the year , Bregolas, the Lord of Ladros, was killed and Dorthonion overrun.  His brother Barahir "the Bold" escaped the destruction of their lands with his son Beren and a number of companions.  He refused to desert the land owned by his fathers, and lived as an outlaw, during which time the servants of Morgoth whittled his band down to only thirteen counting himself.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Silmarillion, "Of Beren and Lúthien"
The surviving companions are named in the Lay of Leithian thus:

They made camp in the hidden lake, Tarn Aeluin, and lived in hiding until 460, when Gorlim "the Unhappy" was tricked by Sauron into thinking that his wife Eilinel was still alive.  In a vain attempt to save her life he went to the dark servant of Morgoth and betrayed the location of Barahirs camp in return for a promise that he and she would be united and set free.  Sauron accepted this information gratefully, and then slew Gorlim, revealing that he had tricked him and Eilinel was dead in truth.
Saurons orcs entered into Tarn Aeluin and Massacre of Tarn Aeluin, including Barahir.  Only Beren escaped the slaughter, for he was out hunting at the time, and, warned by the ghost of Gorlim, returned to find his father and companions all dead.  Soon after he fled Dorthonion forever, and it came utterly into darkness.
== Other versions of the legendarium ==
The account found in The Silmarillion closely parallels that told in full by the Lay of Leithian.
