Túna (Quenya, pron. ) was the hill in Aman, raised by the Valar where the Vanyar and the Noldor founded their fair city of Tirion. In the Years of the Trees the light of the Two Trees of Valinor fell upon its western face and its shadow lay ever to the east.
When Eärendil came to Aman the people of the city had gone to a festival in Valimar so the city was empty. Fearing some evil had befallen the Blessed Realm he turned away until Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, called to him and invited him to Valimar.
A host of Númenóreans camped around Túna when Ar-Pharazôn invaded Aman.
