Fangorn Forest was a deep, dark woodland that grew beneath the southern Misty Mountains, under the eastern flanks of that range. It gained notoriety as the habitat of the Ents in the Third Age. The forest, known as Entwood in Rohan, was named after the oldest Ent, Treebeard.
==History==
File:Steven White Jr. - Fangorn Forest.gif
Fangorn forest was the easternmost survivor of the immense forest that spanned all of Eriador and Calenardhon in the First Age and early Second Age, but which was destroyed by the Númenóreans and Sauron. Fangorn forest was the oldest part of Treebeards realm, and here the Ents retreated.
Fangorn was within the borders of Gondor, but centuries passed without any Gondorian visiting it to prove or disprove the legends around it. Strange stories about Fangorn were still known and told by the time of the War of the Ring, but Men like Boromir compared them to old wives tales told to children.
Beginning in  Saruman started fortifying Isengard and eventually his Orcs started abusing and harassing the forest, its trees and Ents, for his fortifications and war machines.
On 28 February of , Éomers Éored attacked and slaughtered the band of Uruk-hai of Uglúk under the eaves of Fangorn. This allowed Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took to escape the Orcs and pass into the forest. There they met Treebeard and persuaded him of the danger that Saruman poses to the Ents and their forest. Following the Entmoot the rest of the Ents finally agree to march against Isengard taking Merry and Pippin with them and send Huorns to Helms Deep to deal with the Orcs there. Part of the reason is that Sarumans Orcs had been chopping down the trees at the south and west side of the forest, which had angered the Ents.
On 1 March, , Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas entered the forest in search of Merry and Pippin. Rather than the two young hobbits, they encountered the White Wizard. At first they believed it to be Saruman before realising that it was Gandalf, returned from death.
==Etymology==
Fangorn is a Sindarin word that translates as "Treebeard" (from fang = "beard" and orn = "tree"). Entwood is a modernization of Old English Entwudu (wudu "wood"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of Westron. Gondorians used that name, assimilated to their own language., pp. 769-70
