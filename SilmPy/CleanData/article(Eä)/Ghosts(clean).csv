"...to them the Enemy had given rings of power, and he had devoured them: living ghosts they were become, terrible and evil." (Faramir)
Ghosts was a name commonly used to describe the undead, beings which did not perish after what would be a natural death, but which continued to haunt the living in their after-life. While likely often the product of a vivid imagination, the dealings of the Fellowship of the Ring with several types of undead testify that ghosts were a reality in Middle-earth.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, passim
In the late Third Age, the ruined and deserted Osgiliath was known as "a city of ghosts."
