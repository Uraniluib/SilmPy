The Bunce Family was a family of Hobbits. Mimosa Bunce is the only recorded member of the family. 
However, according to Samwise Gamgees poem "Perry-the-Winkle", there was an "old Mrs Bunce" living in Michel Delving; this character might have been based on an actual Hobbit, or just a character in the Hobbit folklore poetry.
