Drengist was a firth in Beleriand. It broke through the Ered Lómin and ended in the Cirith Ninniach. The lands to the north were known as Lammoth, and to the south lay Nevrast.
==History==
Fëanor and the Noldor landed on the shores of Drengist, and their ships were burned at Losgar, which was located at the outlet of the bay. From there, Fëanor and his host pierced into Hithlum.
==Etymology==
In an early manuscript by J.R.R. Tolkien, Drengist is glossed as the Elvish equivalent of Old English Nearufléot. The latter name is said by Christopher Tolkien to consist of Wiktionary:nearu ("narrow") + Wiktionary:fleet#English ("arm of the sea, estuary, firth")., p. 210 The Elvish etymology of the name Drengist itself, however, appears to have been nowhere explained by Tolkien.
