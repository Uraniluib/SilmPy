Durins Day is a rare event noted by Dwarves.
The new year of their calendar was the last cycle of the Moon to begin in autumn, or in Thorins words "the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter". When on this day both the Sun and Moon may be seen in the sky together, it is called Durins Day.
The Moon-letters written on the Thrórs Map predicted that on Durins Day the last light of the Sun as night fell would reveal the Back Door into the Lonely Mountain.
==Calculation==
Unlike The Lord of the Rings J.R.R. Tolkien left no precise timetable for the events of The Hobbit. However, in The History of The Hobbit, Tolkien set 19 October as the date of that years Durins Day., pp. 826,828 
Before the History some calculations were made. According to Andreas Möhn, the Durins Day of  occurred on 22 October of the Shire Calendar. This is based in the assumption that the orbital period of the moon, as described in The Lord of the Rings, was about 20 minutes shorter/faster than today.
Karen Wynn Fonstad made a rough estimation based purely on the traveling times and distances, without any astronomical calculations. She puts the Durins Day on 30 October., "The Hobbit", p. 100
