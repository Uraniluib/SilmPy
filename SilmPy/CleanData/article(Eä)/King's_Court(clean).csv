Kings Court referred to the courts of the King of Númenor in Armenelos, where grew the Nimloth of Númenor.
After Sauron had been taken to Númenor and began to acquire power over Ar-Pharazôn, he urged the king to cut down Nimloth.  When Isildur heard of Saurons purpose he entered the Kings Court one night, alone and in disguise, and took a fruit from the tree.  Isildur had to fight his way out of the court; afterwards the king yielded to Sauron and had the tree felled.
