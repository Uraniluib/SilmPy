Freda is a character invented for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. She and her older brother Éothain (film character) were sent by their mother Morwen (film character) to alert Théoden that the Dunlendings were pillaging through Rohan. Éothain and Freda were kept safe at Edoras until Théoden led his people to Helms Deep, where they were reunited with their mother.
