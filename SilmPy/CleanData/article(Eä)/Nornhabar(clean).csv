Nornhabar ("Dwarrowdelf") is an Elvish name of Moria#Names (later known as Moria) in The Later Quenta Silmarillion manuscripts in the 1950s (cf. The History of Middle-earth XI, p. 206, 209).
Later on, in the essay Quendi and Eldar Nornhabar was replaced by HadhodrÃ»d which was quite immediately changed to Hadhodrond> - a form that entered into the printed The Silmarillion (cf. ibid., p. 386, 419 note 21).
The elements of the Sindarin name are likely Norno "Dwarf" (< norna adj. "stiff, tough") and habar "mine".
