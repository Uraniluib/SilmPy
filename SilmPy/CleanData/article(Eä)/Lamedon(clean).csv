Lamedon was a region and fiefdom in southern Gondor; a series of valleys through which the Ringló and Ciril rivers flowed south.  It was one of the most densely populated regions in Gondor.  At the time of the War of the Ring its lord was Angbor.
During that war, Angbor did not send any soldiers to Minas Tirith during the initial assault, as he chose to defend instead the southern city of Linhir, which rested near the mounds of the river Gilrain.  He held off the Haradrim assailants coming from the Harad and the Umbar for a long while.  The only men Minas Tirith received from Lamedon were some scattered hillmen without a captain.
At the time Aragorn passed through Lamedon with the Grey Company, the Oathbreakers drove forth the assailants from Linhir, though the staunch defenders fled as well.  Angbor alone remained and braved the fear of the Dead.  Then Aragorn bade him gather his folk and follow them.  The Grey Company departed first, and by the time Angbor joined them with all the horsemen he could muster, the Corsairs of Umbar had been driven forth, and the Dead released.  Many of the men of Lamedon, as well as soldiers from Lebennin and various other southern fiefs, came in ships to Minas Tirith, where they bore themselves bravely in battle.  But Angbor, leading four thousand, went by land, coming to garrison Minas Tirith after the hosts departed for the Black Gate and the ensuing Battle of the Morannon.

:Lamedon was an area in the region of Western Gondor, located northeast of the Havens of Belfalas, west of the Ringló Vale in Central Gondor, and southeast of the Blackroot Vale via Tarlangs Neck. Its emblem was a black fist on a yellow field. The capital was Calembel and other settlements included "Dínadab", "Lothgobel" and "Bar Elir". The river Ciril was fed by several tributaries and all were a source of freshwater fish for Dol Amroth. South of the river Ringló on the edges of the Emyn Ernil were two Warning beacons of Gondor, "Maegond" and another only identified as the Fallen Beacon.
