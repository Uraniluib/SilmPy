Mushrooms were an edible fungus. It is said that Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Men.
==History==
Mushrooms were a particular delight of young Frodo Baggins, who would often steal them from Farmer Maggots fields. Old Maggot still remembered it when Frodo came to his Bamfurlong years later, and as a parting gift, Mrs. Maggot gave Frodo a basket of the prized mushrooms., "A Short Cut to Mushrooms" 
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien described himself as a Hobbit in all but size, noting that he was very fond of mushrooms.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 213 (dated 25 October, 1958)
