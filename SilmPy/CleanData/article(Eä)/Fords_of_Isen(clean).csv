The Fords of Isen were the crossing point of the North-South Road on the river Isen in the Gap of Rohan.   At the western border of the realm of Rohan and at a strategic position between the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains, the Ford was constantly guarded by the Rohirrim.
==Geography==
The River Isen (Sindarin Sîr Angren) could not be crossed anywhere south of Isengard, except at the Fords of Isen, which were just above the point where the river bent west towards Belegaer.  In this area the river became broad and shallow, flowing across a stony shelf and branching into two arms about a large eyot.  Only here could large forces effectively cross the river.  During much of the time the Fords were closely guarded from the fortresses of Isengard and the Hornburg at Helms Deep.
==History==
In , two Númenórean Kingdoms were established - Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south.  Between them ran a road built by the Exiles of Númenor to connect their realms.  A traveler journeying southward through Enedwaith along the North-South Road would come to the point where it crossed the River Isen (then known by its Elvish name of Angren). The crossing of the Fords of Isen—the Ethraid Engrin (or Athrad Angren) as they were known in those times—marked the point of entry into the southern land of Gondor.
After the fall of Sauron in  but before Isildur departed from Gondor in , the army of Arnor marched home to Eriador via the Fords of Isen.
In  the Steward Cirion granted the land of Calenardhon to Eorl the Young.  The River Isen then became the western boundary of the new realm of Rohan and responsibility for the great road and the Fords fell upon the Rohirrim, although it was agreed that free passageway would be maintained for all travelers of either people., (iii) Cirion and Eorl
In  a force of Dunlendings led by Wulf invaded Rohan through the Crossings of Isen. King Helm attempted to fight them off at that point but was defeated and retreated to Suthburg while Rohan was overran.
On 18 September, , the Nazgûl crossed the Fords of Isen on their way to the Shire.
In the First Battle of the Fords of Isen (on 25 February, ) the Orcs of Saruman, reinforced by Dunlendings and wolfriders, plus two battalions of Uruk-hai, rushed down upon Théodred, King Théodens son, and killed the Prince.  This blow against the leadership of Rohan was Sarumans main objective in this battle and his forces then withdrew.
Erkenbrand of Westfold maintained a defense at the Fords after the First Battle, under the immediate command of Grimbold, strengthened by Elfhelm and his riders.  However, on 2 March,  the host of Saruman overwhelmed the defenders and swept across the Fords in the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen.
In August of  Aragorn took leave of the reduced company that had formed King Théodens funeral escort near the Fords of Isen.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name for the Fords of Isen was Ethraid Engrin (singular Athrad Angren)., note 47
The literal meaning of Ethraid Engrin is "fords of iron" (athrad + angren).
