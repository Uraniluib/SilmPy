Adan is Sindarin for a "Men" (i.e., as opposed to Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, etc.).  The plural is Edain.  Properly, this word refers only to those Men who are descended from the Three Houses of Elf-friends.
The term often appears as an element of other words, notably DÃºnedain (Man of the West, Numenorean) and Elladan (Elf-man, referring to his Half-Elven heritage).
