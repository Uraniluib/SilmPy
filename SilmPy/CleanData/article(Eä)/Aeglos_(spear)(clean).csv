Aeglos was the name for the spear of High King of the Noldor Gil-galad which was greatly feared by the enemy. It was carried by the King to the War of the Last Alliance, but it was broken when Gil-galad fell in combat against Sauron himself, on the slopes of Mount Doom .
==Etymology and names==
Aeglos means "snow-point" or "icicle"J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings Index. The element aeg means "point" from Sundocarme AYAK, "sharp, pointed", and the element los means "snow".
In editions of The Lord of the Rings prior to 2005, the spear is spelled Aiglos. Tolkien, however, commented in a manuscript that the more correct Sindarin spelling is in fact Aeglos., p. 11Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull (eds), The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 231
