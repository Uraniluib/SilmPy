File:Tim Kirk - Maggots Farm.jpgBamfurlong was a farm in the boggy region of the Marish in the eastern The Shire. It was the home of Farmer Maggot, who (like the other Hobbits in this inhospitable area) lived above ground rather than in a traditional Hobbit-holes. Farmer Maggots farm was well-known in the area for his mushrooms, which he protected fiercely against trespassers with his three fearsome Dogs.
The center of the farm consisted of a large farm house with associated farm-buildings.  They were all made of brick with thatched roofs, and enclosed within a high wall with a wooden gate to the outside lane.
When Frodo Baggins was young and lived at Brandy Hall he occasionally sneaked onto the farm to poach some mushrooms.  On the last visit Maggot had caught Frodo and gave him a beating for his thievery.  Years later Frodo remained in terror of the farmer and his dogs.
On 25 September , Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took came to Bamfurlong in the afternoon. There they met Farmer Maggot and learned that earlier a Nazg√ªl had visited the farm and enquired about Baggins.  The traveling hobbits gratefully accepted a hearty supper before the farmer drove them to Bucklebury Ferry in his wagon.
