Entwade was a ford that crossed the River Entwash some fifty-five miles northeast of Edoras in Rohan. 
On their journey north to the Shire in search of Baggins Family, the Nazgûl secretly and invisibly, on foot, had passed west through Anórien, and on over the Entwade before turning eastward again to return to the banks of the Anduin.This considerable detour suggests that the Entwade must have been the only crossing-place on the Entwash. 
After Éomer attacked the Orcs-band outside Fangorn, he was leading his Riders for this ford when he met Aragorn and his companions in the Eastemnet. He lent the horses Hasufel and Arod to the Three Hunters, and asked that they would follow him at some time across the Entwade to Edoras.Their later adventures in Fangorn Forest probably meant that they eventually came to Edoras by a different route. Cf. , "Rauros to Dunharrow", p. 167 
==Etymology==
Entwade is a modernisation of Old English Entwaed (waed, "ford"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of Westron. Gondorians used that name, assimilated to their own language., pp. 769-70
