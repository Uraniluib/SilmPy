Mermaids, or water spirits, were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in the earliest versions of the tales of Arda and linguistic writings of the Eldar., passim Other names for these creatures were foam-maidens, foam-fays, foam-riders,, pp. 216-7 and nymphs.
==Characteristics==
The mermaids were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser Ainur spirits: sylphs (spirits of the air), sprites (spirits of the earth), and water spirits., p.66
In poems, the foam-fays are described as having "blossom-white hair" shining "in the light of the sun", "pale arms on the seas bosom", and to be "chanting wild songs". They apparently lived in Caverns of the Oaritsi in the sea., p. 227
Ui (the precursor of Uinen) was given the title "Queen of Mermaids"., p. 263, p. 97
==Names and divisions==
A basic division of two groups of water spirits, with their Elvish names, are given as follow:
*Oarni (troop of Ossë): "spirits of the sea"; also Oaritsi (from oaris, "mermaid")
*Falmaríni and Wingildi (troop of Ossë): "spirits of the sea-foam" (also wingildin, "foam-maidens, foam-fays"; wingild- "nymph", or "foam-maiden", p. 100; wingi "mermaid, foam-maid"; and wingil "sea-nymph", p. 42)
Also mentioned are flathwin or -nir "foam fay", and nendil, nennil "waterfay". A Qenya gloss is given as nindari ("river-maid, nymph")., p. 14
==The later legendarium==
Mermaids are not mentioned in the later versions of the legendarium. Many of the classes of beings references in The Book of Lost Tales were superseded by the concept of the Maiar, which were not introduced until the reworking of the Annals of Valinor into the Annals of Aman.
==Inspiration==
Patrick H. Wynne and Christopher Gilson have noted that Tolkiens use of nymphs (and related spirits) is likely influenced by Wikipedia:Paracelsuss chart of four elementals: sylphs (air), pygmies or gnomes (earth), nymphs (water), and salamanders (fire)., p. 8
==Portrayal in adaptations==
