Lindon was a region of the Westlands. Initially populated by Green-elves, in the following Ages it became an important Elvish realm, known for its harbors and Elven Ships that would sail for the Aman.
==Geography==
Lindon was a name of Ossiriand, a region west of the Blue Mountains, in Eastern Beleriand. After the deluge of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, Lindon became the westernmost land of the continent of Middle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke into Lindon and the Blue Mountains and divided the realm into Forlindon (North Lindon) and Harlindon (South Lindon). The eastern border of Lindon was the Lune, beyond which was Arnor.
==History==
===The First Age===
The name Lindon was first used by the exiled Noldor for the region of Ossiriand.
Lindon was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath, the rest of the land having been broken or submerged by the tumults., p. 78 However, Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain, creating the Gulf of Lhûn.
Many of the surviving Elves of drowned Beleriand, especially the exiled Noldor, relocated to Lindon by the beginning of the Second Age, where they were ruled by Gil-galad.
===The Second Age: Kingdom of Gil-galad===

Gil-galad founded the Kingdom of Lindon in  ruling over the Noldor and Sindar and all the Elves of Lindon alike. They also built the Havens (Mithlond, and also likely Harlond (Lindon) and Forlond) and many Elves left from there to Valinor. 
The Noldor mainly dwelt in Forlindon, and the Sindar (and surviving Green-elves) in Harlindon (a fief under the rule of Celeborn)., p. 328 (Note 65), (Introduction & Note 2) Presumably the surviving Edain also stayed for some time alongside the Elves of Lindon, until they left for Elenna (). But there was some tension between the Elves; some of the Sindar did not wish to live under Gil-galad alongside the Noldor, and went to the Silvan Elves in the east, who were their Telerin kin. Some Noldor also left to found Eregion (), the second of the two Noldorin realms. 
In  Entulessë, a ship from Númenor arrived in Mithlond where Gil-galad welcomed the Númenóreans, before reestablishing contact with their Mannish kin, the Middle Men., entry "600"
During the War of the Elves and Sauron, Sauron had overrun Eriador. The Elves called that time Dark Years as many fled to Lindon where Sauron could not enter, and thence over the Sea to the Uttermost West. Eventually Tar-Minastir sent ships to Lindon, responding to Gil-galads plea. The combined army of Elves and Númenóreans drove Saurons forces out of Eriador.
In the tumult following the Downfall of Númenor, Lindon suffered great loss as "the sea rode in upon the land", and therefore had shrunk when the Third Age began., p. 183
===The Third Age: Rule of Círdan===
After the War of the Last Alliance, most of the Ñoldor finally departed for Valinor, and Lindon became depopulated, now ruled by Gil-galads lieutenant, the Sindarin elf Círdan the Shipwright, who kept building ships for the departing Elves.
During the days of Kings, most of the High Elves that still lingered in Middle-earth were found in Lindon. Some Dwarves had dwelt in the eastern side of the Ered Luin, such as at Thorins Halls, especially the part south of the Gulf. Men did not go to Lindon. 
Aside from Elves, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins also went to Valinor from the Grey Havens, and a family tradition held that Samwise Gamgee, having been himself a Ring-bearer, albeit briefly, did likewise, in the year . Círdan stayed in Mithlond into the Fourth Age until as he said, "the last ship sails" and the remaining Eldar passed into the Aman. It is unclear just what the fate of the Elves of Middle-earth was in the early Fourth Age or how long Círdan and his remaining folk dwelt at the Havens and continued to build the great ships that carried the Elves to the Undying Lands.
In the Fourth Age, few Elves remained, if any at all.
==Names and Etymology==
In a post-Lord of the Rings writing, J.R.R. Tolkien says that the name Lindon was coined by the Green-elves, derived from Nandorin(?) *Lindānā. The Sindar called the country Dor Lindon and the Noldor Lindóne (or Lindónë) but both also adopted the name Lindon., p. 385
The name Lindon contains the element lin- "sing, song" as also seen in Lindar. Lindon (Quenya, pron. ) means "land of music", 
The translation "Land of the singers", conceived to be a name in the Nandorin tongue, has been suggested by David Salo, Arden R. Smith, Patrick H. Wynne, et al. in their linguistic contribution to Arnor: The Land
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In early versions of the The Lord of the Rings Appendices, Gil-galad is said to have founded Lindon in  10., pp. 168, 173
