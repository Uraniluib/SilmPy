Heathertoes was one of the strange botanical names preferred by the people of Bree. 
==Etymology==
While heather is an element that appears in English real-life surnames, Heathertoes has no parallel in English. 
Tolkien suggested that the name refers to a joke of the Big Folk for the Little Folk, who walked bootless and collected heather, twigs and leaves between their toes., p. 759
==Men or Hobbits?==
The narrative of The Lord of the Rings doesnt make clear if the family was of Men of Bree or of Hobbits. The above etymology suggests that it was a name given to Hobbits by Men. 
However in the narrative the name is listed among those used by the Men, and Mat Heathertoes, who is named as one of the casualties of Bree during fighting there, appears to be listed among Men rather than Hobbits.
