Strawberries were wild berries found in several regions of Middle-earth. 
Bilbo Baggins tried to satisfy his hunger with wild strawberries growing near a stream in the upper Vales, as Thorin and Company escaped the Goblin-town during early July.See User:Gamling/Hobbitdates
During the last years of the Third Age, strawberries were among the many fruits produced by The Shire, and were enjoyed by the young Hobbits.
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkiens adventure in Switzerland in 1911 was his inspiration for the journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, and it is quite possible he consumed strawberries during this time.. Michael Coren notes, "For dessert he liked a trifle or, in summer, strawberries with lots of cream."Michael Coren, J.R.R. Tolkien: The Man Who Created the Lord of the Rings, "End Times" 
In J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator, No. 23 contains an illustration by J.R.R. Tolkien of a strawberry.
