tarkil is a Quenya word, used in the Westron as a name for a Men of Númenóreans descent., p. 603, p. 101
The Orcs corrupted the word, and used tark as an insulting term for a Gondorians.
It has been suggested that tarkil also probably lies behind the meaning of the name of Tarcil, the sixth King of Arnor.http://www.encyclopedia-of-arda.com/t/tarkil.html Tarkil at http://www.encyclopedia-of-arda.com/ The Encyclopedia of Arda (accessed 14 May 2011) 
==Etymology==
In the The Etymologies, tark derives from Primitive Quendian tāra-khil (Sundocarme TUR and KHIL)., pp. 364, 395tarkil as related to the root KHIL also appears in a later manuscript, cf. , p. 101. It has been suggested that tarkil means "literally high follower (since the Elves referred to Men as Men because they were the Afterborn Children of Ilúvatar)".Cf. TUR for the connection to "high" and KHIL for the connection to "follower".
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Lord of the Rings, the word appears only in a footnote (added in the George Allen and Unwin second edition, 1966) in Appendix F. However, at one time it was destined for more prominence: in the early drafts of the work, Aragorn himself is known as "the Tarkil", but this was changed to "the Dúnadan" in the published text., p. 603, p. 8
