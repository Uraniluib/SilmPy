1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Arwen does not appear.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Arwen is voiced by Sonia Fraser.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the Council of Elrond. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the The Riddle of Strider. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely Kath Soucie. 
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem inspired by The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen. 
:In the first film, she rescues Frodo Baggins from the Nazgûl at Bruinen, thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was Glorfindel who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and Gandalf arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword Hadhafang,a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father. 
:There are  scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for Valinor, and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion. 
:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick with grief possibly over Aragorns seemingly hopeless cause and his impending death. Elrond takes the reforged Narsil, now Andúril, to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with the One Ring, and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorns coronation without any signs of illness.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Arwen is a non-playable character and can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from Rivendell into the Misty Mountains. She was not involved in the main storyline - or any side-quests for that matter - until 2010, when she passed Halbarad the banner she had made for Aragorn during the Epic Book Oath of the Rangers.
2011: The Lord of the Rings: War in the North:
:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While spotting appearance of Liv Tyler, her role is closer to the book that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from movie adaptation. She is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.
