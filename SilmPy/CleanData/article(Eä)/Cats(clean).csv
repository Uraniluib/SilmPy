Cats were animals that lived in Arda.
==History==
Other than use as company, for which the Hobbits and Bree-men used pets, cats were used for the hunt and for spying. They were soft-footed, keensighted and agile.
===The Cats of Berúthiel===
In the late ninth and possibly early tenth century of the Third Age, Berúthiel, wife of Tarannon, King of Gondor, kept cats, nine black and one white. The marriage of Tarannon and Berúthiel was not a pleasant one: his love for the Belegaer drove her mad. She hated all making, all colours and elaborate adornment, and set her cats to spy on everyone, learning their secrets. Berúthiel conversed with the cats and read their mind and memory. She even set the white cat to spy on the others, to torment them. Berúthiels reign of terror came to an end when Tarannon put her  and her cats on a ship and set it adrift. It was last seen passing Umbar., note 7 
All memory to them was erased (and the Book of the Kings), though legends of the cats and their ability to spy remain.
===Other cats===
Though there are no other cats that play a large role in history, some are mentioned in Hobbits folklore (for example, the Hobbit poem Cat (poem)). Bob, the ostler of the Prancing Pony, had a cat. After Frodo Baggins sang The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late (in which the ostler of an unnamed inn had a tipsy cat that played a five stringed fiddle), several patrons suggested that he had to do the same. Similarly, a cat, or "four-legs", was part of an old Riddle-game Bilbo Baggins asked Gollum. 
==Etymology==
In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens early conceptions of an Elvish language, the word for "cat" is miog; miaug or miog is "tom cat"; and miaulin is "she cat"., p. 57
The Qenya word for a "kitten" is tis., p. 20
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Perhaps the most important cat in the legendarium was Tevildo, the Prince of Cats. Mentioned only in early writings, Tevildo was a demonic servant of Melko, who would eventually be replaced by SauronJ.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Book of Lost Tales Part One, "The Music of the Ainur (Book of Lost Tales)", page 52. He is the principal antagonist in The Tale of Tinuviel.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, "The Tale of Tinuviel"

==Inspiration==
Especially in the case of Berúthiel and Tevildo, cats in Middle-earth are portrayed in a negative light. It could be argued that Tolkien was not a cat-person. When a cat-breeder asked permission to use names from The Lord of the Rings for her cats, Tolkien replied to Allen and Unwin: 

==Portrayal in Adaptations == 
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Cats are found throughout Middle-earth, especially in Bree-land. There is a "cat lady" who has a house full of cats. Lore-masters can also have a non-combat cat pet.
