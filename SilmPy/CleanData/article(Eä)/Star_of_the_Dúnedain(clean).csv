The Star of the Dúnedain was a silver brooch, shaped like a many-rayed star, worn by the Rangers of the North.
The Dúnedain Rangers who came to Aragorn at Dunharrow wore these on their clothing, specifically to fasten their cloaks on their left shoulder. It served as part of their identity, and the only ornamentation the Rangers ever wore in their journeys. The Star was also considered a badge of honor, and after the events of the War of the Ring, in  Aragorn gave this insignia to Samwise Gamgee, the Mayor of the Shire.
