The Attack on Dol Guldur was an expedition launched by the White Council in  against the fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood.
==History==
===Prelude===
When Sauron re-emerged, he established Dol Guldur on Amon Lanc after . His corrupting shadow was only known as the "Necromancer", and as a result Thranduil led his people away. The Council of the Wise long feared the Necromancer might indeed be Sauron; Gandalf himself had entered Dol Guldur a couple of times, finally confirming that Sauron was its master. At first Saruman opposed the idea of an attack as he was searching for the One Ring in the area by then, but later, fearing that Sauron was also looking of the Ring, he finally agreed to an attack in .
===The Battle===
Gandalf carefully planned the attack to occur at the same time as the Quest of Erebor, knowing that Sauron and Smaug could not assist each other. After leaving Thorin and Company at the outskirts of Mirkwood, he joined the White Council and they marched against the great fortress. 
Of the actual battle not much can be said (if this was simply a duel between great powers, or if it involved the use of armies of any kind). Thanks to the devices of Saruman, the Wise, Sauron was driven out from Dol Guldur,however Sauron, having already made his plans, fled to his ancient realm of Mordor.
===Aftermath===
With victory theirs, Gandalf immediately left for Lonely Mountain, where he would take part in the Battle of Five Armies. After these events, Gandalf and Elrond dicussed their victories and agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.
However Dol Guldur was not destroyed; it remained standing, staffed by the Witch-king, and later Khamûl., note 1, p. 352 It was not before the War of the Ring when the fortress was finally Fall of Dol Guldur.
