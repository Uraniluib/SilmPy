===Films===
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Radagast is entirely omitted. Without Radagasts involvement, Gandalf goes to Isengard of his own accord (because he wanted counsel from Saruman) and is able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc by speaking to a moth who sends for the help of the Eagles.
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Although Radagast is only briefly mentioned in The Hobbit, Radagast features in The Hobbit films and is played by Sylvester McCoy. He is highly eccentric and somewhat absent-minded, and also uses a sled pulled by several large rabbits (which he refers to as Rhosgobel Rabbits) as his main means of transportation.
:After discovering that a shadow has fallen on Mirkwood (having had to heal his hedgehog friend Sebastian because of its power), Radagast enters Dol Guldur and is attacked by the Witch-king. He finds that the fortress is occupied by a Sauron#Saurons Return and travels to inform Gandalf. He finds Thorin and Company just west of Rivendell and hands Gandalf a Morgul-knife. He draws a pack of Wargs and their Orcs riders away on his rabbit-pulled sled so that Thorin and Company can flee in safety.
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Radagast briefly appears, investigating the High Fells of Rhudaur with Gandalf, and accompanying him to Dol Guldur. Gandalf then dispatches him to send news of what theyve found to Galadriel, while Gandalf enters the fortress ruins alone.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:Radagast first appears when he comes in Dol Guldur during the Attack on Dol Guldur by the White Council to take the weakened Gandalf to safety. After they escape, Gandalf requests a horse, takes Radagasts staff and also commands him to summon bird and beast for the impending Battle of Five Armies. He arrives with the Eagles late in the battle along with Beorn. They demolish the Orc forces and effectively help end the Battle of Five Armies.
===Radio series===
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Donald Gee provided the voice of Radagast. He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given chronologically.
