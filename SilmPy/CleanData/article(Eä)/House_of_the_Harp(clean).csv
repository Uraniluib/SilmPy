File:Narfil Pal√πrfalas - House-of-the-Harp.jpg

The House of the Harp was one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim, led by Salgant.  Its people were brave warriors, and were dight with tassels of silver and of gold, and a harp of silver shone in their blazonry upon a field of black, though Salgant bore one of gold.  They resisted their treacherous lords orders during the Fall of Gondolin and deserted to aid Glorfindel of Gondolin and the House of the Golden Flower at the Great Market.  They drove the enemy back into the market as the Orcs pursued Glorfindel, but they were leaderless, and many of them were trapped burned to death or poisoned by the breath of the Dragons.
