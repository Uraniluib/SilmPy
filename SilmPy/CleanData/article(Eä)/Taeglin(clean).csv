The Taeglin was a river in Beleriand, a tributary of Sirion.
It rose in the Ered Wethrin and flowed southeast through Brethil to join Sirion on the borders of Doriath. It had two minor tributaries: Celebros and Malduin.
The river could be forded at the Crossings of the Taeglin, near the western border of Brethil. A road ran through it from Nargothrond to Minas Tirith (Beleriand).
==Etymology==
The element taeg means "boundary"., pp. 309-10
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier writings, the river was called Teiglin. As revealed in the The History of Middle-earth series, the rivername should actually have been spelt Taeglin ("Boundary River"). This was a relatively late change which was not adopted into the published The Silmarillion, which uses the old name, as does The Children of HÃºrin.
