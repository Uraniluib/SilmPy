Epessë, Quenya for after-name, is a nickname or honorific given to an elf at some point in his or her life. It is one of the essë, or given names, of High Elves, along with the father-name  and amilessë ("mother-name")., Note on Mother-names, p. 339 The epessë was a public name, and the person it was given to sometimes adopted it as one of his or her actual names.
An example is Gil-galad ("Star of Radiance"), which was the mother-name of the last High King of the Noldor. His father-name was Rodnor., The Parentage of Gil-galad, p. 350 Upon becoming king he was given the epessë Ereinion ("Scion of Kings") and called Gil-galad., The names of Finwës descendants, p. 347
