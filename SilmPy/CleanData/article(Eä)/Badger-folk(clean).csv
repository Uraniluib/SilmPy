Badger-folk were creatures of legend, mentioned in Hobbits verse. Nothing is known of their origin or history.
==Characteristics==
According to the poem, the Badger-folk lived in secret houses connected by tunnels under a hill in, or nearby, the Old Forest. They appear to have been sentient and capable of speaking. Although Badger-brock once forcefully brought down Tom Bombadil to their burrows, the Badger-folk do not appear as truly evil creatures, but perhaps rather cunning or tricky.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
: Only mentioned briefly, the Badger-folk of the Withywindle appear badgerish but live after the manner of Hobbits. They are one of the Fairies., p. 63
