According to the legend, it appeared as a crown above Durins reflection in Mirrormere despite the fact it was day; he saw it as a good omen and built Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar.

The form of the constellation is not known. Its possible that the seven stars on Doors of Durin around the crown signify the constellation. Valacirca is also a constellation of seven stars. 
Steve Gardner concluded that it could also have been Wikipedia:Auriga_(constellation) or the Wikipedia:Corona_Borealis.Vinyar Tengwar #13, p. 3
Since the constellation was a miraculous event, its also possible that its stars were only a vision, and not an actual constellation set on menel.
