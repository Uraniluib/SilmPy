File:Michael Rasmussen - Morgulduin.png
The Morgulduin was a river of Gondor that began in Morgul Vale in the Ephel DÃºath.  It ran westward past Minas Morgul until it reached the Cross-roads in Ithilien, where its course turned southwest until it entered the Anduin just south of Osgiliath.  Just to the north of the stream was the road from Osgiliath up to Minas Morgul.
As Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Gollum were approaching the Crossroads they heard the voice of the river, which sounded cold and cruel.  The river was polluted - near Minas Morgul a cold steam issued from the river whose stench and vapours sickened the hobbits.
==Etymoloy==
It has been suggested that Morgulduin is a Sindarin name meaning "black magic river" (consisting of morgul + duin).
