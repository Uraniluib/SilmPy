Yule was the two days in the calendars of the Hobbits that marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next.On a modern calendar, they fell on the 21 and 22 December. Around them, the six-day festival of Yuledays was held, running from 29 December Foreyule through 2 January Afteryule. 
Due to a peculiarity of the Shire Calendar, the Yuledays always fell on the same days of the week. The last day of the year, 1 Yule, was always a Highday (Friday), while the first day of the following year, 2 Yule, was always a Sterday (Saturday). 
The formal use of Yule in the Shire calendar cannot, by definition, predate the foundation of the Shire in . However, its appearance there represents a survival of an older tradition, and the name Yule for a midwinter festival was known as far from the Shire as Rohan and Gondor.
==Etymology==
}}
Yule is a translation of a Hobbitish word, not occurring in Westron.
However its possible that it derives from a form of Northern Mannish and later used in Rohirric. Since Gondorians of the Third Age were in part Northmen, the word was recognisable as a northern name for the midwinter festival., p. 781
In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens early conceptions of an Elvish language, the word for "Yule(night), i.e. Log-night" is durufui. Tanfui means "Yule night"., pp. 31, 69
