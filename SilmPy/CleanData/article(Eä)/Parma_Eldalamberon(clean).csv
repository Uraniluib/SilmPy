Parma Eldalamberon (Quenya "The Book of Elven-tongues"), often simply Parma or PE for short, is a journal of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship dedicated to J.R.R. Tolkiens languages. 
==History==
Parma Eldalamberon was started in 1971, as an irregular periodical published by the Linguistic Fellowship of the Mythopoeic Society. The first editor was Paula Marmor. It ran for five issues, ending in 1977, but resulted in the landmark book An Introduction to Elvish. Of that book Paula Marmor was co-author, several other co-authors, Bill Welden, Christopher Gilson, Lawrence J. Krieg and editor Jim Allan, were regular contributors to Parma and parts of it had grown from their articles in the journal. The publication of The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien made most of the discussions outdated, however, and the project was shelved.
Another regular contributor was Robert Foster, who had already published his Guide to Middle-earth, which he revised and extended to The Complete Guide to Middle-earth after the publication of The Silmarillion.
Six years later, Chris Gilson revived Parma. He kept the original name, despite the fact that the increase in Quenya material gave the correct translation as Parma Eldalambion. Gilson published Parma outside the Linguistic Fellowship,David Doughan, "Book Reviews: Parma Eldalamberon 6", in: Quettar 21 (November 1984), p. 8 but after the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship was founded it became associated with that organisation.
In 1991, Christopher Tolkien approved of Parma publishing original text by Tolkien, especially the long linguistic texts for which he could find no place in The History of Middle-earth.Christopher Gilson, "Foreword", in: Parma Eldalamberon 11 (1995), p. 2
In the meantime, Vinyar Tengwar also started publishing Tolkiens original texts. Now, they are both edited by more or less the same team, and Parma specializes in the longer wordlists, while Vinyar Tengwar publishes Tolkiens essays.David Bratman, "Posthumous Publications", in: J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia (edited by Michael D.C. Drout), p. 547-8
