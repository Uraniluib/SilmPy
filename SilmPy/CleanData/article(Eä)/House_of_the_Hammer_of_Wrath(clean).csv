File:Narfil Palùrfalas - House-of-the-Hammer-of-Wrath.jpg

The House of the Hammer of Wrath was one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim of Gondolin whose lord was Rog.  They were great smiths and craftsmen, and revered Aulë. In battle they carried great maces like hammers, and heavy shields, for they had strong arms.  The device of this people was the Stricken Anvil, and a hammer that smites sparks about it; this was set upon their shields, for red gold and black iron was their delight.  They had a great hatred for Morgoth and the Balrogs, and during the Fall of Gondolin they slew a number of the fell beasts, being the first of Elves and Men alike to slay a balrog. All of them perished in that battle, when a large force of Balrogs, Orcs and Fire-drakes was unleashed upon them.
