The Uruk-hai attack on Osgiliath in  was the first large-scale attack against Gondor after the end of the Watchful Peace.  The race of uruks, described as black Orcs of great strength, first appeared in this battle and were able to sweep across Ithilien and take Osgiliath.  Boromir (Steward of Gondor) son of Denethor I was able to defeat this force and clear them from Ithilien, but the city was finally ruined, its great stone-bridge was broken, and no one lived in the city thereafter.  During this brief war Boromir received a Morgul-wound that shrunk him with pain and caused his premature death but twelve years after his father.
