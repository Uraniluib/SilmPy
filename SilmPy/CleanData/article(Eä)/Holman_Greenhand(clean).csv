Holman Greenhand was a Hobbit of the Shire, noted for being a fine gardener.
==History==
Holmans grandfather and namesake, Holman the greenhanded, initiated both the family name and the family profession: gardening. Holman became a gardener in Hobbiton, and one of the gardens he tended was that of Bag End. Around , he took on his distant cousin Gaffer Gamgee as an apprentice. 
One morning of that spring, Gandalf visited Bag End, but found its master, Bilbo Baggins, not at home. Holman informed him that Bilbo had gone on one of his walks, as it was the Elves Yestare. Holmans description of Bilbo convinced Gandalf he had found the perfect man for his mission, to re-take Lonely Mountain.
When Bilbo went missing - that is, on his mission - Holman and Hamfast had their hands full in making sure the garden wasnt trampled as the place was swarming with Hobbits, hoping to get a piece of the Baggins estate.
Gaffer took over the job around ,: "Gaffer Gamgee had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years" about which time Holman retired or died.
==Etymology==
Holman means "hole-man", and is distinct from the real-life English surname, p. 760 which contains holm "river island" rather than hol "hole".Jim Allan (ed.), An Introduction to Elvish, "Giving of Names"
