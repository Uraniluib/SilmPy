File:Jeff Reitz - Precious Gold Ring.png
Gold refers to both a valuable mineral in Middle-earth and golden colour or golden light.  Although valuable, the metal was not nearly as valuable as mithril (Gimli stated that when the Dwarves mined mithril in Moria it was worth ten times the value of gold and that after the coming of Durins Bane mithril was beyond price).
==History==
Gold was present in the deeps of Arda since its creation by Ilúvatar. It was no doubt discovered by Aulë, the great smith who was the first to make use of it. Afterwards, it was to be used by all speaking peoples of earth particularly the Dwarves who mastered it and by the Noldor.
The One Ring was made of gold, as was Vilya, the Elven Ring of Elrond.  The treasure of Smaug also contained gold, wrought and unwrought.

In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens early conceptions of an Elvish language, the word for "gold" is glôr (glôriol means "golden, like gold", and glôrin means "golden, of gold"). The poetic word for "gold" is Culu., pp. 27, 40
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
