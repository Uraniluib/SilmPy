The Goatleaf Family were a family of the Men of Bree. As was typical among the Men of that region, the name comes from a plant.  
Harry Goatleaf at one time watched the West-gate of Bree, but threw in his lot with Bill Ferny and Sarumans thugs during the War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
It is linked to Wikipedia:honeysuckle or Wikipedia:woodbine. Its French name, ch√®vrefeuille is also a medieval lay, and would therefore presumably have been familiar to J.R.R. Tolkien., p. 758
