Himring was a hill in the northeast of Beleriand. It was east of the Pass of Aglon and west of Maglors Gap. The greatest hill of that region, it was wide-shouldered, treeless, with a flattened summit, and surrounded by numerous lesser hills. After the War of Wrath Beleriand at the end of the First Age, the peak of Himring remained above the waves.
==History==
===The fortress of Maedhros===
The fortress on Himring was built when the Sons of Fëanor went east after Thingol became aware of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. It was the chief fortress of Maedhros, eldest of the Sons of Fëanor, from which he guarded the north-eastern border region that became known as the March of Maedhros.
The fortress stood firm through the Dagor Bragollach, and many survivors from the surrounding regions, including Maedhros brother Maglor, rallied there. In the battle the Orcs had taken the Pass of Aglon, but Maedhros was later able to retake the Pass using the forces from Himring.
Himrings fortress remained for centuries, until the Nirnaeth Arnoediad; its possible that it was forsaken, as the sons of Fëanor would no longer have had the strength to man it, had they so chosen.
===The Island===

After the War of Wrath, when the western lands were flooded, the plains about the hill were drowned and the top of the hill was all that remained of Himring. Left standing as an island, Himring lay off the north-west coast, about twenty-five miles out from the shores of northern Lindon.
==Etymology==
Literally, the name means "cool-cold"., him, p. 200 Himring is translated as "Ever-cold".
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the original maps that accompany The Lord of the Rings, the island was labelled Himling, since this was Tolkiens early name for what later would become Himring in The Silmarillion., p. lxvii
