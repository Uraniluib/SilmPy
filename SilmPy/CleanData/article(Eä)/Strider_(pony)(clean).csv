Strider was a pony acquired by Frodo Baggins in Minas Tirith. He named it "Strider" after Aragorns own nickname from Eriador. 
Strider rode with Frodo back to the Shire at the end of the War of the Ring. Two years later he carried him westwards in the Last Riding of the Keepers to the Grey Havens on the coast of the Belegaer.
