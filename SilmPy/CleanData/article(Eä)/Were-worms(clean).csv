Were-worms were creatures of an unknown kind, possibly mythical and presumably related to Dragons, that were said to dwell in the Last Desert.
== History ==
The Were-worms were only mentioned once so almost nothing is known about them. It is not even certain that they actually existed — the Hobbits had a rich folklore full of fantastic creatures, and Were-worms quite possibly fall into that category.
==Etymology==
The element "were-" is a Germanic term that refers to male humans. It suggests a shapeshifting creature like the werewolf of modern-day folktales. In Middle-earth, "Werewolves", such as Draugluin, did not shapechange and the name perhaps refers to the size and intelligence.
Thus Were-worms, if they did exist, could be a Men-like type of Dragon, though this must remain in the realm of speculation.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest fragment of The Hobbit, Bilbo offered to walk to the "Great Desert of Gobi and fight the Wild Wire worms of the Chinese"., p. 9  In a slightly later version J.R.R. Tolkien made this "the last desert in the East and fight the Wild Wireworms of the Chinese"., p. 40
== Portrayal in adaptations ==
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:Azogs forces use giant worms to tunnel underground towards the city of Dale, which Azog calls "earth eaters". When the creatures appear during the Battle of Five Armies, Gandalf identifies them as "were-worms".  Apparently they are only used for tunneling, not fighting, because they do not take part in the ensuing battle.
