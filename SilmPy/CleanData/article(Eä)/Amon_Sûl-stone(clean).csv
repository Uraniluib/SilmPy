The Amon Sûl-stone was a Palantíri that rested in the Arnorian Weathertop.  Like the other seeing-stones it was a deep black crystal, spherical, and perfectly smooth.  However, the stones were not all alike and the Amon Sûl-stone, like the Osgiliath-stone, was too large to be lifted by one man.
==History==

In  the watchtower was burned and destroyed when Angmars forces invaded Arnor, but the Stone was successfully carried back to Fornost.  Arthedains last King, Arvedui, saved this palantír as well as the Annúminas-stone when Arthedain was overrun by Angmar in . 
With these and other heirlooms, he fled into the far north, where he was given shelter by the Lossoth. At last a ship from the Grey Havens came to rescue Arvedui, but after he had boarded, its hull was crushed by the ice, and all aboard were lost. The Stone of Annúminas, along with that of Amon Sûl, were lost in the shipwreck, and sank.
