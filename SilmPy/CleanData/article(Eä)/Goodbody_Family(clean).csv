The Goodbody Family was one of the many prominent families that lived in the Shire, perhaps of the upper class.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 171 The Goodbodies were connected to the Baggins Family through Bilbo Bagginss great aunt Lily Baggins, who married one Togo Goodbody. They were also connected to the Bolger Family; Cora Goodbody married Rudolph Bolger.
Among the Baggins Family#Baggins Of Hobbiton - Family Tree in Appendix C to The Lord of the Rings, their descendants are summed up in just two words: Various Goodbodies. Bilbo acknowledged the connection at his famous Bilbos Farewell Party: we know that at least some of the various Goodbodies were present at that feast.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
The Goodbodies were added as guests to Bilbos Farewell Party in the fifth draft of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings.  However, at that time the family name was Gawkroger, a Yorkshire surname meaning "clumsy Roger"., note 10
