Greenland may be a name for Valinor used by J.R.R. Tolkien.  It appears only once, in a quick note written c. late 1939, while Tolkien was still brainstorming for his plot in the Fourth Phase.  It states clearly, speaking of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in the end of the story, "They go west and set sail to Greenland".  In a more complete set of notes dating to the same approximate time, however, there is similarly written "a green land by the Sea"., pp. 212, 216 (note 7)
