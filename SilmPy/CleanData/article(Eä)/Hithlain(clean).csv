Hithlain was a strong substance used by the Galadhrim of Lothlórien, which was grey and felt silky. It was used in the making of Elven rope, which were flexible and light, yet extremely robust. It may also have been used in the creation of the grey Elven cloaks of Lórien.
Samwise Gamgee and Frodo Baggins climbed down a cliff of the Emyn Muil with the help of a hithlain rope, which Sam tied to a stump at the top.  When Sam tugged the rope in annoyance that theyd have to leave it and it would help Gollum get down, it came loose and fell on him.  Frodo thought Sam had tied it badly, but Sam thought it came because he called it.
When Frodo and Sam tied their Elven rope around Gollums ankle he screamed in pain.  Apparently the material, or as Gollum claimed, the fact that Elves made it caused him agony when it touched him.
