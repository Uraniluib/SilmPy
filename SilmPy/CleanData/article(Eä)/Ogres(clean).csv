Ogres were monstrous and destructive creatures of legend and folklore of Middle-earth, although it can not be said if they indeed existed.
During the Riddle-game with Gollum, Bilbo Baggins in his attempt to solve Gollums fifth riddle, he sat thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales..
No ogre is ever mentioned in the annals of the Elder Days and none played any role in the wars and battles. It is entirely possible that they were a mythical race. 
It is also possible that Ogre were just another name for the Trolls.
==Etymology==
Wiktionary:ogre#English derives, through French, from the Greco-Latin name Orcus. It is interesting to note that Orcus is supposedly the origin also for the Old English word Orc, although Tolkien doubted that etymology.J.R.R. Tolkien, "Letter to Gene Wolfe" (letter)
== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Ogres were used by J.R.R. Tolkien in early drafts of the legendarium as a name for one of the monsters bred by Morgoth along with Gongs and the other úvanimo.
They are mentioned as cannibal giants. Those of the north were known as Hongwir while the southern ones were named Sarqindi., "The Creatures of the Earth", p. 9 Sarqindi is glossed as "Cannibal-ogres",, p. 347 and Patrick H. Wynne and Christopher Gilson have suggested that hongwir might be related to the Qenya word ongwe (meaning "pain")., p. 6
Tolkien mentioned again ogres out of context in analyses of the name Orcs: "...the gloss Þyrs ogre..." , and of the name Ettendales: "This is meant to be a Common Speech (not Elvish) name, though it contains an obsolete element eten troll, ogre.", pp. 762, 770
==Inspiration==
In his childhood, Tolkien and his brother Hilary Tolkien gave a miller and a farmer, who frightened the boys and lived near the Sarehole Mill in the Moseley area of Birmingham, the nicknames "White Ogre" and "Black Ogre", respectively.Humphrey Carpenter, J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography These characters also appear in stories written by Hilary Tolkien.Hilary Tolkien; Angela Gardner (ed), Black & White Ogre Country
Tolkien enjoyed reading E.A. Wyke-Smiths The Marvellous Land of Snergs (1927) to his children. The book recounts the adventures of two children and a Snerg ("a race of people only slightly taller than the average table"), and their tale include meeting the vegetarian ogre Golithos.Douglas A. Anderson (ed.), Tales Before Tolkien, pp. 359-60
