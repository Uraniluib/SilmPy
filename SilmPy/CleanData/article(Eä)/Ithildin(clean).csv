__NOTOC__
Ithildin was a substance made by the Elves out of the metal mithril and used by the Gwaith-i-Mírdain in constructions such as gateways. Ithildin could only be seen by the silmë of the Moon and stars, and even then remained hidden until a "magic" word was said. The designs on the Doors of Durin were made from this substance.
==Etymology==
In the legendarium, Gandalf translated ithildin as "starmoon".
J.R.R. Tolkien stated that ithildin is a Sindarin name, meaning "moon-star(light"), "moonlight" or "starlight". The word contains the elements Moon#Other names ("moon") + tîn#Noun ("spark; star; twinkle of stars"). He noted that the correct Sindarin form should be ithildim., pp. 39, 66
