Forlond was a harbour that lay on the northern shore of the Gulf of Lune, in the Elves land of Forlindon. It had a counterpart on the southern shore: the Harlond (Lindon).
Forlond was located at the mouth of an unnamed river that traversed Forlindon, some two hundred miles to the northwest of the Grey Havens.
When the ships of the Gondorians general EÃ¤rnur arrived in Lindon during the Angmar War, it is told that they filled the Forlond, Harlond and the Grey Havens.
