__NOTOC__

Háma was the Doorward of Théoden and Captain of the Kings Guard of Rohan. He was a loyal and devoted man, though he often anticipated his orders.
==History==
Háma served as the doorguard of Edoras, the abode of the Kings of Rohan.  On 2 March , four guests arrived at his post: Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and Gandalf.  He stood by the rules of the house, and ordered them all to surrender their weapons. He entered into a long argument with Aragorn who refused to hand Andúril to anyone else until he agreed to do so at the wish of Gandalf. He permitted Gandalf to keep his staff, a deliberate decision which would prove decisive in the healing of his king. 
For this oversight, Háma was reprimanded by Théoden, and briefly relieved of his position as the doorguard. Háma did his Lords bidding, and also released Éomer from captivity. The Kings sister-son was imprisoned by Gríma, who was shortly before overthrown with the use of Gandalfs staff. Háma arrested Gríma, and found various missing items in his possession, including Herugrim, the Kings sword.
Háma rode with Théoden to the Hornburg, and fought in the Battle of the Hornburg that ensued shortly after. He fell before the great gate, and his body was hacked to pieces by a horde of Uruk-hai.  He was given the honour of being buried in a grave of his own under the shadow of the Hornburg. Despite his annoyance with his doorward, Théoden obviously had an affection for Háma, and grieved at his fall, so much so that that he personally cast first earth on his grave.
On 5 March when Théoden rejected the words of Saruman the hewing of Hámas body before the gate of the Hornburg was among the grievances he cited.
==Etymology==
The name Háma comes from Old English, and means as much as "home, house, dwelling". The same element is used in Hamfast (disambiguation).The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, page 501

1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Michael Spice voiced Háma. On the ride to Orthanc the dialogue of a nameless riders suspicions of Gandalfs motives in the novel is transferred to Hama.  In the book the rider is rebuked for these suspicions by Hama, but in this production the rebuke is made by Eomer.  
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:John Leigh plays Háma. The lengthy dialogue with Aragorn is absent in the movie, since Aragorn is not bearing Andúril. He is killed during a Wargs-attack on the road to Helms Deep, rather than in the battle itself.
:Later in the movie, Aragorn is seen talking with "Haleth (film character)". The name could be a reference to the synonymous siblings Haleth son of Helm and Háma son of Helm, the sons of Helm.
