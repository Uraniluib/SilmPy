Tea was a beverage that the Hobbits (specifically Shire-hobbits) enjoyed alone or socially.
A time of resting and relaxing, the tea-time was considered a meal on its own, between lunch and dinner. It was customary to offer guests for a cup of tea.
Bilbo Baggins invited Gandalf for a cup of tea when he unexpectedly arrived to Bag End. After his invitation, Gandalf showed up with Thorin and Company.
In a poem, the Lonely Troll served Perry-the-Winkle some "fulsome tea".
