==Etymology==
Aradan was the name given to Malach in Hithlum when he went to serve the Kings of the Noldor. The name means "Noble Man" in Sindarin (from ara- = "noble" and adan = "Edain").
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally it was Hador who led the people of the third house of the Edain across the Ered Luin into Beleriand; when this was changed so that Marach became the earliest leader then Malach was added to the ancestors of Hador.
