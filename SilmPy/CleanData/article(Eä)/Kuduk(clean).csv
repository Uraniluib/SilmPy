Kuduk (pl. *Kudugin) was the actual Westron word with which the Hobbitss called themselves. It is translated as "Hobbit."
==Etymology==
It is suggested that this developed from an older word, kûd-dûkan, meaning holbytlan. Although the Hobbits called themselves kuduk, they had forgotten the meaning of the word.
==Other versions==
Before this published word, J.R.R. Tolkien considered the form cûbuc pl. cûbugin which was apparently dropped later., p. 49
