Atarinya is an Elvish term meaning my father. It is recorded twice in J.R.R. Tolkiens work, used once by Elendur (son of Isildur) to his father Isildur, and also long before by Tar-Aldarion to his father Meneldur in NÃºmenor. In both cases, the opposite form would be onya, my son. The same word-ending could be used to create affectionate forms from personal names: for example, Meneldur also called Tar-Aldarion Anardilya (my Anardil - with Anardil being Tar-Aldarions original name).
