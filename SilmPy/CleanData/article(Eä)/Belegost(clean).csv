Belegost was one of two great Dwarves Dwarf realms in the Ered Luin.
==Description==
Belegost lay in the north central part of the Ered Luin, north of Nogrod and northeast of Dolmed, guarding one of the only passes through the mountain range., p. 24 ("But the Dwarves had built some great Mansions in those mountains the Ered Luin (commanding the only passes)")
==History==
Belegost was home to the Dwarves of Belegost. During the mid First Age its king until Nirnaeth Arnoediad was Azaghâl.
Belegost was probably founded sometime during the Years of the Trees., p. 24 ("...which had certainly been founded long ago ... before the coming of the exiled Noldor, probably before the Eldar of the Great Journey ever reached Beleriand")
At the end of the First Age, Belegost was ruined in the War of Wrath, and around the Second Age 40 of the Second Age the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began to migrate to Moria, abandoning Nogrod and Belegost.  However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterward. p. 235
Additionally, one of Tolkiens earlier maps, as shown by Christopher Tolkien in The Treason of Isengard (and also echoed in Karen Wynn Fonstads The Atlas of Middle-earth) still shows Belegost in the Ered Luin in the time of the Third Age, indicating that Belegost may have survived the upheavals of the Second and early Third Ages, or that at least a more recognizable mansion had persisted therein than at Nogrod.
==Etymology==
Belegost (beleg + ost) was a Sindarin translation of the original Dwarvish name Gabilgathol and both mean "Great City".  Unlike other names of the Silmarillion, the text also gives us an English rendering, which was possibly from Westron: Mickleburg. Mickle is a root meaning "big"; see also Michel Delving.
The citys Khuzdul name Gabilgathol contains the elements gabil "great" and gathol "fortress".
Túrosto was the name in Quenya for Belegost., p. 389
==In adaptations==
In The Atlas of Middle-earth the fortress is incorrectly called Gabilgathod.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, Beleriand and the Lands to the North, Map
