Girithron is the Sindarin name for the twelfth month of the year, following Hithui, according to the calendars of the Dunedain. Girithron in the Kings Reckoning and Stewards Reckoning corresponded to Foreyule in the Shire Calendar (approximately modern 21 November through 20 December).
==Etymology==
The name apparently contains girith "shivering" and raun "moon, month".
