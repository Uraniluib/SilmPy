Wolves were of old allied with the Dark Lord; Morgoth bred the two greatest of their kind, Draugluin and Carcharoth, and Sauron was wont to take the form of a great Wolf. The lesser kinds were sometimes used as steeds by the Orcs.
Wolf is also used as a short form of Werewolves.

2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)
:Lobelia Sackville-Baggins believes that wolves are in the Shire, and demands that Frodo Baggins alert the local Shirriff, Robin Smallburrow about it by ringing Bywaters town bell. Robin initially dismisses Lobelia and Frodos warning, but this changes when he is attacked by a white wolf the following night, and Frodo must save him. More wolves are encountered outside Bywater, then in the Old Forest, the Barrow-downs, and the streets of Bree. 
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Wolves are found in nearly every corner of Middle-earth. They are a popular mount of goblins, especially in Moria and Mirkwood.
