Kibil-nâla was the Dwarvish name for the river that ran through Lothlórien, known to the Elves as Celebrant and to Men as the Silverlode.
==Etymology==
*kibil ("silver") + nâla (?"channel; path; rivercourse")
The rivers name seems to come originally from the workings of the Dwarves, as they seem to have discovered silver in the river., p. 175
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest drafts of Appendix A, the rivers name was given as Zigil-nâd., pp. 279, 286 Considering the meaning of zigil, Edouard Kloczko has proposed that Kibil-nâla is not the name of the actual river, but only of "the reappearance of the river". He connects kibil to Adûnaic khibil, "spring".Edouard Kloczko, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/268 Elfling message 268 This seems unlikely, as Tolkien explicitly stated: "Silverlode dwarfish sic Kibilnâla"., p. 241 (note 36)
