Kingfishers were bright blue birds.
==History==
Kingfishers lived on the waterside, feeding on fish. One notable kingfisher lived, according to Hobbits folklore, in the Old Forest. It harassed Tom Bombadil, and upon flying away lost a feather. Tom took to the bright blue feather and replaced the old battered Swans-feather in his hat. Tom still bore a noticeable large blue feather on his hat when he met Frodo Baggins and his companions., "The Old Forest"
Gondor was also familiar with the Kingfisher; when Faramir saw what he thought was a black squirrel or kingfisher, he asked Anborn whether the were any black kingfishers in Mirkwood,, "The Forbidden Pool" a forest known for its black animals., p. 480 Anborn saw the mysterious creature had four limbs, and quickly dismissed both ideas. It turned out to be Gollum, hiding in the Forbidden Pool.
==Etymology==
Kingfishers were originally called the Kings fisher, as they, like swans, were royal animals.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 240 (dated 1 August, 1962)
==Names==
Several Eldarin words for the bird are known as well: in Quenya, it was called halatir (or halatir(no)), from the SundocarmÃ« SKAL and TIR, literally meaning "fishwatcher"., roots KHAL, SKAL and TIR Noldorin had a similar word, heledirn.
==Inspiration==
The Kingfisher, and especially the rivalry between the kingfisher and the swan in Bombadil Goes Boating, was inspired by its use in European royal houses. Originally, the swan was the animal owned by kings, but later, it became the kingfisher. Even in Middle-earth, both yearned for the return of the Aragorn.
