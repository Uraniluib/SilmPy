Barliman Butterbur was a Men of Bree, the owner of The Prancing Pony.
A short, fat, red-faced Men, he appeared to have had a rather bad memory, "One thing drives out another" he says. 
==History==
The Prancing Pony in Bree was kept by the Butterbur Family for many generations and Barliman inherited it before the War of the Ring. He had two Bree-hobbits employees: Bob, who worked in the stables, and Nob, a servant. 
During the War, Gandalf wrote a Gandalfs letter to Frodo Baggins and told Barliman to send it to Hobbiton. Barliman could not find anyone for the task, and eventually forgot the letter altogether, leaving Frodo uncertain as to Gandalfs fate and causing him to start his journey much later than the letter indicated.
He did not remember it until autumn, when Frodo and his companions arrived to stay at the inn, and even then it was long before the connection was made. He did, however, remember to produce Aragorns credentials.
When Gandalf finally arrived at The Prancing Pony, he was furious with Barlimans forgetfulness, but quickly forgave him when he found out the Hobbits were alive. He even went so far as to put a blessing on his beer.
After the War of the Ring, Barliman was amazed to learn that Strider, a former patron of the Prancing Pony, had become king of Gondor and Arnor.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the first version of the events at the Prancing Pony, written in pencil, the name of the innkeeper was "Timothy Titus", a name from an old incomplete story by J.R.R. Tolkien (in which the character bore no resemblance to Mr. Butterbur).  "Timothy Titus" was written over in ink with the name "Barnabas Butterbur" in Tolkiens manuscript and was created as a very fat Hobbit before he was subsequently changed into the man called "Barliman"., note 3
==Etymology==
Barliman means "barley-man", a suitable name for an ale-brewer.J.R.R. Tolkien, "Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings" in Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull (eds), The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, pp. 754-5

1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Barliman was voiced by Alan Tilvern.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:James Grout provided the voice of Butterbur. Grout played what is a fairly minor character with great panache, and much of his garrulous dialogue from the book is intact, especially in the longer 1982 episodes.  Butterbur also appears in the penultimate instalment when the returning company stop off at Bree.
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:He is played by David Weatherley, although the character is not named and most of his scenes from the book (including the reference to Gandalfs letter) are not in the film.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Barliman is a non-playable character that can be found at the Prancing Pony. The player meets with him during Volume I The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, Book I: Stirrings in the Darkness, Foreword: "An Unwanted Guest".
2010: The Lord of the Rings: Aragorns Quest:
: Butterbur appears briefly at the start of the Bree mission, where he informs Aragorn that he might learn the location of the Hobbits by asking around town.
2011: The Lord of the Rings: War in the North:
:Barliman Butterbur is the inn-keeper, and can be found behind the bar in the Prancing Pony. He tells the player news about troubles in the south, and Southerners who have come lately to Bree, and information about the Prancing Pony, that it almost exists as long as Bree.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue

2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Though he does not appear in the film, a character credited as "Butterbur, Sr." appears in its prologue running the bar at the Prancing Pony -- apparently meant to be Barlimans father, thus implying the inn was a family-run establishment.
