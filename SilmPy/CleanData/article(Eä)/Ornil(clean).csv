Ornil was an Elves of Nargothrond who, according to the Grey Annals, met Túrin after the Battle of Tumhalad () when they were hurrying back to Nargothrond and leaves were falling from trees in a great wind. Ornil said to Túrin: "Even so fall the people of Nargothrond, but them there shall come no Spring." Nothing more is known of him.
