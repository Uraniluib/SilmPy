Brethil, later called Sarch nia Chîn Húrin, was a forest between the Taeglin and the Sirion, originally part of Doriath but outside the Girdle of Melian. The main feature of the forest was the hill of Amon Obel.
==History==
After dwelling east of the river Gelion, the Men of the House of Haleth were granted Brethil by King Thingol, on the condition that they guard the Crossings of the Taeglin. Some Drúedain also dwelt there. The main settlement of the Haladin was Ephel Brandir on Amon Obel. 
The Men of Brethil for a century protected Nargothrond and also took part in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where they were all slain. Their Chieftain of the Haladin Handir was slain by Orcs north of Brethil on .
Túrin came here after the destruction of Nargothrond and the journey to Dor-Lómin, and rested here for a while, until rumours came again about Glaurung, the father of all dragons. At the borders of this forest Glaurung was slain by Túrin.
After the death of the Dragons Glaurung his slayer Túrin wrenched his sword Gurthang from the belly of the beast. This action caused a spurt of black venomous blood to drench Túrins hand.  The pain of his burned hand and a baleful glare by the dragon caused Túrin to swoon and appear as if dead. Soon after Nienor, still under the dragons curse and unaware of her true name, came to the scene and bound her husband Túrins hand. She cried for him to awake but this only aroused Glaurung one last time. He hailed her by her true name and as he died she recalled all of her past. Niënor was horrified for she carried within her womb her brothers child. Brandir witnessed the scene and cried out to Niënor, but she fled and jumped to her death at the Cabed-en-Aras. When Brandir walked back to Nen Girith where the people of Brethil cowered he spoke of the deaths of the children of Húrin and renamed the land, stating that it would never be free of grief.
==Etymology==
brethil (Sindarin word) is Sindarin for  "silver birch".
Sarch nia Chîn Húrin was the name that Brandir gave to Brethil, meaning "Grave of the Children of Húrin".
