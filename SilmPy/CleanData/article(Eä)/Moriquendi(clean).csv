The Moriquendi (singular Moriquende) were the Elves of Darkness, who did not behold the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor. 
The term usually referred to the Avari, the Elves that did not join the Great Journey over the sea and remained in the East or passed the Blue Mountains and lingered on the shores of Middle-earth. However the term included also the Úmanyar ("Those not of Aman"), the Eldar who originally started on the journey but for some reason did not finish it. Those were typically Sindar and Nandor.
An exception to this categorization was King Thingol, who had been in Valinor as an ambassador of the Elves, and saw the Light. Though he did not complete the journey, and therefore considered one of the Úmanyar, he was not a Dark Elf. 
Out of the 144 unbegotten Elves to awaken at Cuiviénen, 82 chose to remain and thus became the forefathers of the Moriquendi, outnumbering the population of the Amanyar.In other words, the Dark Elves consisted of the 57% of the Unbegotten Elven population in the beginning of days.
The term "Dark Elf" seems to hold an additional special (not explained) meaning, as it is given as a special title of Eöl of Nan Elmoth. It is also used as an insult by the Sons of Fëanor to King Thingol (which is incorrect, since Thingol alone of the Sindar was reckoned under the Calaquendi).

In Norse mythology, there are the Light-elves (Wikipedia:Light elves) and the Dark Elves (Dökkálfar or Wikipedia:Svartálfar), a tradition which was well known to J.R.R. Tolkien., "Appendix A: Origins of the Legend", p. 359
