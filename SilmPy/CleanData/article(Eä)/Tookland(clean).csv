Tookland was a wide region of the Shires Westfarthing that was the historical province of the Took Family, and so of the hereditary Thain of the Shire. The Tookland lay to the south of the East Road, with its chief and central township at Tuckborough in the Green Hills. There, burrowed into the hillsides, was the famous and historic home of the Tooks, Great Smials. Somewhat to the west of Tuckborough lay the smaller of the Tooklands main settlements, Tookbank.
