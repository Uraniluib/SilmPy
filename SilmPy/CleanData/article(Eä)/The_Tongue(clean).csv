The Tongue was the narrow point of land at the south-eastern tip of Lothlórien, formed where the Celebrant flowed into the Great River Anduin. The angle between the two rivers was treeless, and covered by a green lawn flowered with bright golden elanor (flower). On the southern bank of the Tongue was a hythe - a landing-place - from which river-boats could set out into the Celebrant to navigate either river. It was from this hythe that the Fellowship of the Ring set out after their time in Lothlórien to begin their travels on the Great River.
