Arda Unmarred (Valarin. Aþāraphelūn Amanaišal, Quenya. Arda Alahasta or Arda Envinyanta "Healed") is a concept in Elves religion and philosophy. It refers to Arda (the world) as it existed in a perfect state following its creation, as opposed to Arda Marred, the flawed world as it currently exists. Arda Unmarred was a world not yet tainted by the evil of Morgoth. This reflects the original intention of the creator, Eru Ilúvatar, and his servants the Ainur.
The Elves lament the spiritual and physical corruption of Arda. They live in Estel (philosophical concept) that one day this damage will be undone and the world will be purged of all evil, restoring it to a paradise state.
According to a prophecy, after the Final Battle, a second Music of the Ainur will be sung, forming a new world, called Arda Unmarred or Arda Healed. Men (it is specifically stated in the Ainulindalë that Elves will not be involved) will sing with the Ainur in this second music. Nothing is known about the Second Music, except that it will be greater than the first.
