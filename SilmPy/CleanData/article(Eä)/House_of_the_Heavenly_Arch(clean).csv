File:Narfil Pal√πrfalas - House-of-the-Heavenly-Arch.jpg

The House of the Heavenly Arch was one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim, led by Egalmoth.  They were a folk of "unaccounted wealth", and were arrayed in many bright colors, for the "heavenly arch" referred to a rainbow.  Their arms were set with jewels that flamed in the light over the sky.  Every shield of that battalion was of the blue of the heavens and its boss a jewel built of seven gems: rubies, amethysts, sapphires, emeralds, chrysoprases, topazes, and amber.  An opal of great size was set in each of their helms.  They were great swordsmen, but also great archers, and with the House of the Swallow defended the walls of Gondolin during the Fall of Gondolin in its northern part, pouring clouds of arrows over the hosts of Orcs. Slowly the battle was lost and they retreated towards the Square of the King, the survivors being gathered together by Tuor along with those from the House of the Swallow. Few of the Heavenly Arch escaped the burning Gondolin and most likely dwelt with Egalmoth at the Mouths of Sirion.
