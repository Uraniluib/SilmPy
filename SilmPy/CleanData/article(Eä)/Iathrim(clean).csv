The Elves of Doriath were those Sindar that lived in the broad forests of central Beleriand, Neldoreth, and Forest of Region, under the Kingship of Thingol and later Dior. These people, whose Melian was of the order of the Maiar and whose King was the High King of the Sindar, were held to be the highest and noblest of the Sindar kindred.
