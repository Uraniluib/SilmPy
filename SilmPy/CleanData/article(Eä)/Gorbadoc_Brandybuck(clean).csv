In 1978, Jim Allan suggested that the Celtic-sounding name Gorbadoc is "a slight alteration of Wikipedia:Gorboduc or Gorbodugu", a fictional pre-Roman king of the Britons.Jim Allan, An Introduction to Elvish, p. 202 In 1988, the publication of The Return of the Shadow confirmed that J.R.R. Tolkien had indeed used the name Gorboduc in four extant manuscript versions., pp. 17 (note 5), 26, 36, 38
His name Broadbelt derives from his generous table and waistline.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 171
