Wights was a name used for undead beings,: "And some said: They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong, into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough." especially as a short form for the Barrow-wights., passim
==Etymology==
wight is derived from Old English wiht, meaning "living being, creature".  The related wikipedia:Old Saxon wiht means "thing, demon". Douglas Harper, "http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wight wight" at http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary (accessed 30 December 2010); a curiosity is that the Swedish cognate vätte ("spirit of the earth, gnome") was used to translate the word "Orcs#Orcs and Goblins" (cf. J.R.R. Tolkien, Britt G. Hallqvist (transl.), The Hobbit) It has been suggested that J.R.R. Tolkien had this later "connection to the underworld in mind when he chose to refer to the grave-spirits of the Barrow-downs as wights".Mark Fisher, "http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/b/barrowwights.html Barrow-wights: Evil spirits out of Angmar" at Encyclopedia of Arda (accessed 30 December 2010)
Many works of fantasy fiction, role-playing games and computer and video games use the term wight as the name of spectral creatures very similar to Tolkiens Barrow-wights: Dungeons and Dragons has created a monster called "Wikipedia:Wight (Dungeons & Dragons)", a kind of undead, and the new terminology is also exemplified in A Song of Ice and Fire series: "Who has been beyond the wall of death to see? Only the wights, and we know what they are like. We know."George R. R. Martin (2005), A Song of Ice and Fire book IV, A Feast for Crows
