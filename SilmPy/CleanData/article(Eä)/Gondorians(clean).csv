Gondorians was a name that referred to the inhabitants of Gondor., also Letter 144, Letter 256 Although the people of Gondor initially were entirely of Númenóreans descent, called the Dúnedain of the South, they came to mingle with many different Pre-Númenóreans, notably with the influx of Northmen from Rhovanion.
==History==
The gifts of the Númenóreans were slowly withdrawing since Elendil came to Middle-earth. A turning point was the Kin-strife, when many of the great were slain. King Eldacar (King of Gondor), who himself had Northmen blood, showed favor to the Northmen who supported him; many noble houses, including the royal House of Anárion were more mingled with the Middle Men. 
The second evil after the Kin-strife was the Great Plague that gratly diminished their numbers to the point of withdrawing from the fortresses and the watches over Mordor, and abandoning Osgiliath.
==Culture==
The high men of the South married late in their life and had few children. Several of the Kings of Gondor were childless.
Gondorian ships were usually black and silver in color.
Before meal, the Gondorians looked towards the West.
==Lifespan==
In the Third Age, the lifespan of the Dúnedain was less than of their ancestors in Númenor; specifically after the end of the Kings of Gondor, the waning was even swifter. In contrast, their cousins, the Dúnedain of the North, maintained significant longevity.
