The Siege of Osgiliath occurred in .  During the Kin-strife, Castamir, a descendant of the kings, led a rebellion against Eldacar (King of Gondor), the son of King Valacar.  Eldacar had the support of the Northmen in the service of Gondor and of the Dúnedain of the northern part of the realm, but they were overmatched by the forces of Castamir, drawn from the people of the coasts and of the great havens of Pelargir and Umbar.  Although he fought valiantly, Eldacar was pushed back into capital and there besieged until Castamirs greater army and hunger drove him out.
In the siege and subsequent burning of the city the Tower of the Stone of Osgiliath was destroyed and the palantír was lost in the Anduin.  When the city was taken, Castamir showed his cruel side, putting Ornendil, the son of Eldacar, to death and causing slaughter and destruction far above the needs of war.
