The Forest of Neldoreth was the Beeches-forest that lay between the banks of the Esgalduin and the Mindeb that formed the northern and lesser part of the Kingdom of Doriath.  
==History==
It was in the Forest of Neldoreth that Lúthien was born and later these woods were part of the enclosure called the "Girdle of Melian". It was also under the trees of Neldoreth that Beren first beheld Lúthien dancing in the moonlight.  Later, when Sauron had cast Beren into a pit and Lúthien resolved to rescue him, Thingol had her imprisoned in a house built high in the branches of the highest tree of the forest, called Hírilorn.
When Treebeard was carrying Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took to Wellinghall he chanted to them about walking in the woods of the First Age.  He recalled coming to Neldoreth in Autumn and enjoying the gold and red and sighing leaves of Taur-na-neldor (an alternate name for the forest).
