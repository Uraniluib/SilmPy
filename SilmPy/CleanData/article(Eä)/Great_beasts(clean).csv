Great beasts were used to pull the battering ram Grond (battering ram) during the Siege of Gondor.
Whether these beasts of burden used by Sauron were a foul breed, Oliphaunts, or a race of unknown animals from distant lands, is impossible to say for certain as we lack a more detailed description of the creatures.

2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:In this video game the basic design of the great beasts from Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings is kept. However, a new idea is introduced: the creatures called "great beasts" were originally used by Dwarves in the Misty Mountains as underground draft animals (depicted as being much smaller than Saurons beasts of burden). The Dwarves called them yurgs.http://pc.ign.com/articles/690/690364p3.html Battle for Middle-earth II - The Dwarves at http://pc.ign.com/ IGN, accessed 16 October 2010
