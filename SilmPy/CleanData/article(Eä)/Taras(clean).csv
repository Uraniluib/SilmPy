Mount Taras was a tall mountain at the western end of a line of hills that were outliers of the Ered Wethrin.  It towered over a green cape between Nevrast and West Beleriand on the shores of Belegaer.  Below its slopes Turgon built his halls of Vinyamar when he first returned to Middle-earth. Long after Turgon had deserted Nevrast for Gondolin, Tuor came there and spoke with Ulmo.
