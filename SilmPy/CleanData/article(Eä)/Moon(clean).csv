Ithil, the Moon, is a celestial object seen in the skies of Arda at night.
==History==
File:Darryl Elliott - Moon.jpg
After the Darkening of Valinor and the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion, the White Tree, bore one last Flower of Silver before its end. According to the lore of the Elder Days, Aulë and his people made a vessel to carry to the silver flower aloft, and Tilion, one of the hunters of Oromë; was granted the task of steering the new Moon through the sky.Of , Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor
Tilion guided his charge up into the western skies just as Fingolfin entered Middle-earth, and so marked the beginning the First Age. After seven lunar "days", Arien, the Sun also rose. The Moon first rose above Valinor in the far West of the World, but Varda came to change this arrangement, so that the Moon would pass beneath the World, and arise in the east instead, as it does to this day. 
According to the legends of the Elves, Tilion was an unsteady steersman, sometimes dwelling overlong beneath the Earth, or appearing in the sky at the same time as the Sun. He was drawn to the bright new Sun, launched from Valinor shortly after his own vessel, and his coming too close to his fiery companion was said to account for the darkening of the Moons face.
According to a tradition, Melkor will discover how to break the Door of Night, and will destroy both the Sun and the Moon.
==Lore of the Moon==
===Númenóreans===
For the Númenóreans, the Sun and the Moon - Ûri and Nîlû, called collectively also Ûriyat ("two suns") or Ûrinîl(uw)at ("two sun-moon") - were personified entities, the Man in the Moon and the Lady in the Sun.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), Sauron Defeated, "The Drowning of Anadûnê" They were the chief heavenly lights, and the enemies of the eternal Dark.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 347 (dated 17 December, 1972)
This notion was carried over to Gondor, where the sons of Elendil each had either of the lights in his name: Isildur and Anárion, and with them their cities Minas Anor and Minas Ithil, and the lands that lay about them, Ithilien and Anórien.
===Hobbits===

When the Hobbits were still a Wandering Days people, their calendaric unit was not a week , but a month, governed more or less by the Moon. However, through contact with alien peoples (perhaps the Dúnedain of Arnor) they adopted the notion of weeks which formed the Shire Reckoning.
In Hobbit folklore, the moon was imagined to be inhabited by the Man in the Moon.
===Dwarves===
The Dwarves based their calendar on the Moon. The Dwarven year began with the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. However it seems that by the late Third Age the Dwarves adopted the Stewards Reckoning, and few had the skill to calculate the Durins Day.
==Other names==
*Isil: a (Quenya, pron. ) or Iþil (Vanyarin, pron. ) was a name given to the Moon in Quenya by the Vanyar.  It is said to mean "the Sheen".
*Rána: although the name given to the Moon in Valinor was Isil, the Noldor preferred a name of their own, Rána, the Wayward. Rána (or Rana, pp. 376-7), meaning "The Wanderer" or "the wayward",, p. 130 is a Quenya word derived from the Common Eldarin Sundocarme RAN ("wander, stray, meander")., p. 13 In the The Etymologies appears the Qenya form Rana, and Noldorin Rhân. Both are descendant forms of Primitive Quendian Ranā ("Moon")., p. 383 (entry RAN-)
*Ithil: a Sindarin word meaning "the moon" or "(full) moon"., p. 232 (citing from the Unfinished index; form: ithil), pp. 30, 39, 121 (form: Ithil The word can be found in Minas Ithil, Ithilien#Etymology, and Ithildin#Etymology. In the The Etymologies, Noldorin Ithil ("(poetic name of the) Moon") derives from the Sundocarme THIL/SIL., pp. 361, 385, 392 (entries I-, SIL- and THIL-)
*Elfaron: Meaning "Star-hunter" being a coumpound of EL and PHAR. (entry PHAR)
*Phanaikelūth: The oldest recorded name of the Moon was its Valarin name, Phanaikelūth. This was said to mean "bright mirror";, p. 401 making it the only name to accurately describe the origin of moonlight.
*Gollum referred to the Moon as The White Face.; ; . Cfr. "Yellow Face" (Sun#Names_of_the_Sun by Gollum).
*The full moon of mid-November was referred as the Wikipedia:Hunters moon.
==Inspirations==
===Gender===
File:Mani and Sol.jpg
The fact that the Moon in Tolkiens legendarium is connected to a male entity or person (like Tilion or the Man in the Moon), is obviously derived from the Germanic mythology of which Tolkien was an expert; for example the Old Norse Wikipedia:Máni is a male lunar god and Wikipedia:Sól is a female solar goddess.
On the contrary, other mythologies of the world had connected the Moon with the feminine, like the Græco-Roman deities Wikipedia:Luna, Wikipedia:Selene, Wikipedia:Hecate and others. 
The gender of the celestial deity, is mirrored also in the gender of the noun for "Moon" in these languages (eg. French la Lune but German der Mond). This was also perhaps the case with some of the languages of Arda (Ghân-buri-ghân refers to the Sun as a woman).

===Phases===
Tolkien was very careful in the moon phases described in his works, so that they fit the passing of days realistically. Tolkien was remodelling the phases while reviewing the book in 1944 so that he preserves the consistency. The moon phases described in the Lord of the Rings correspond to the phases of years 1941-1942 and it is probable that he used a recent calendar for reference.http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html Unfortunately, some minor errors (that can be detected only after thorough measurement and astronomical knowledge) slipped his attention (for example cf. 22 September)
===Calendar===
The mention that Hobbits and Dwarves based their year and months on the Moon, mirrors the Wikipedia:lunar calendar used by several ancient cultures through history, such as the Hebrews. The observation of the Moon phases formed the months; the words are even related etymologically in some languages (cf. the English words "Moon" and "month").
==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early concepts===
In the early versions of The Silmarillion as described in The Book of Lost Tales Part One, a part of the The History of Middle-earth series, the Moon was described in great detail as an immense island of crystal. It was also said there that the youth Tilion was said to secretly be in love with Arien, the maiden who guided the Sun, and that because he steered the Moon too close to the Sun the Moon was burned, causing the darker spots on the Moon which in reality are caused by the great basalt plains known as Lunar maria.
The Man in the Moon is even described in those writings, as being an old Elf who secretly hid on the island of the Moon, and built his minaret there. This is alluded to further in Tolkiens Roverandom, where the Man in the Moon also lives in a Minaret.
In writings which are older than the material from which the publised Silmarillion was drawn, the Moon was described at one point rather as being created by Morgoth as a mockery of Arda the world, but this notion was abandoned.
===Later concepts===
In the Round World version of the Silmarillion version of the legendarium, the Sun and the Moon were not the fruit of the Two Trees, but actually preceded the creation of the Trees. Instead, the Trees preserved the light of the Sun before it was tainted by Melkor when he ravished Arien.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:The moon appears in the background of various scenes. In a notable animation error, it is visible behind both Frodo Baggins and Boromir when the latter tries to persuade Frodo to give the Ring at Amon Hen.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/goofs Goofs, http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb.com
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:The Moon - or rather, an image of the near side of the moon in the plenilune - is used as a backdrop for scenes playing at night, and appears recognizably in the sky in cut scenes. It appears behind Aragorn as he finds Meriadoc Brandybuck in the streets of Bree,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), "Bree" behind the Watcher in the Water, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), "Hollin Gate" and behind the fell beast in the final cut scene.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), "Amon Hen"
==In other stories==
The moon is an important location in J.R.R. Tolkiens childrens story Roverandom. After being turned into a toy dog, the wizard Psamathos Psamathides summons his postman Mew (a seagull) to take Rover to the moon to see the Man-in-the-Moon. One side of the moon is white with a dark sky and tall mountains, whilst the dark side of the moon is dark with a light sky and deep valleys. Although home to spiders, the main enemy on the moon is the White Dragon (later renamed the Mottled Monster).
