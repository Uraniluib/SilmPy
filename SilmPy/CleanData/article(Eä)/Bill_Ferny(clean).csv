Bill Ferny was a man of Bree.
==History==
Bill Ferny lived on the last house of Bree, and was an opportunistic backstabber, who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He served as a spy for the Nazgûl, and relayed information about Shire-hobbits to them.
Ferny was at the Prancing Pony on September 29th when his colleague, a Squint-eyed Southerner joined him. The two of them saw "Mr. Underhill" (Frodo Baggins) vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the Nazgûl, and the Ringwraiths came to attack that night., "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"
After the Ringwraiths raided The Prancing Pony, Bill and his allies went to the inns stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Bree: Bill the Pony. He sold him for twelve silver pennies to Aragorn and the Travellers. As a parting gift, Samwise Gamgee threw an apples at his head.
The Squint-eyed Southerner was spotted inside Bill Fernys house when the company set out to Weathertop.
When trouble came up the Greenway from the South, Bill Ferny and several others opened the gates to them, and left with them after a short battle. He joined Saruman, and guarded the gate at the Brandywine Bridge. His command over the local Shirriffs was hard, but he was no match for the Travellers who tried to break in. He fled into the night, but not after his old pony had kicked him in the back.
==Etymology==
Bill is a name Tolkien used to represent the Westron name Bil, which was a short for names as Arambil, Bildad and Bilcuzal, all of unknown meaning. Ferny is a reference to the wikipedia:Fern, as many surnames of Bree were botanical in nature., p. 757
