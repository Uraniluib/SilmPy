Sterday (archaic form Sterrendei) was the first day of the week in the Shire Calendar. It was dedicated to the stars, representing the Númenórean day Orgilion.
After the time of Isengrim Took II, Sterday was also the first day of each year, falling always on 2 Yule (and 2 Lithe). As such, 1 April and 1 October always fell on Sterday.
==Etymology==
Sterday represents an archaic Hobbitish form "Sterrendei", a word preserved in the Yellowskin. It is dedicated to the stars.
It is translated as "Saturday" in The Lord of the Rings but as it was the first day of the week, it corresponded more to our Monday. For this reason, The "Saturday" referred in the poem The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late, actually refers to the Hobbitish Mersday.
