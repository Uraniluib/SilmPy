Faramirs defense of Osgiliath was a futile attempt to stem the advance of Saurons army advancing from Minas Morgul towards Minas Tirith through the ruins of the city on the Anduin.
==Prelude==
10 March after the departure of Frodo Baggins from Henneth Ann√ªn, Faramir barely returned to Minas Tirith from Osgiliath (he was almost caught by Fell beasts until Gandalf saved him).   
Early in the morning of 11 March Denethor ordered his son back to Osgiliath, hoping to make the Enemy pay dearly for the crossing of the river. Despite his warnings that Sauron could easily afford to lose ten times Gondors losses, and that those so far afield would find retreat perilous, Denethor insisted that Faramir defend the ruined city because no army could cross the river north of Cair Andros or southwards towards Lebennin.  After the meeting of the Council Faramir took what strength he could to Osgiliath.
==The Battle==
On 12 March, , Saurons army met and shoved Faramirs scratch forces west out of Osgiliath.  Although the Enemy did pay dearly for the crossing, it was less than hoped.  In secret, numerous floats and barges had been built in East Osgiliath which allowed Saurons forces to swarm like beetles upon the defenders.
==Aftermath==
Faramir retired with his men to the Causeway Forts where the ongoing battle resumed.  Soon this battle would also be lost, Faramir was struck down by the Black Breath. Only a sortie by Imrahil and his knights saved him and the rest of the wounded from that onset. Saurons army advanced and siege of Gondor would begin.
==Portrayal in adaptations ==
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Orcs, led by Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul), swarm across the Anduin and engage Faramirs garrison throughout the ruins of western Osgiliath. When his forces begin to be overwhelmed and the city is clearly lost, he leads a retreat back to Minas Tirith, harried by the Ringwraiths along the way. Denethor then delusionally orders Faramir to lead a counter-attack to retake Osgiliath, despite Faramirs complaint that the city is completely overrun. The Pelennor Fields are not protected by the Rammas Echor and there are no Causeway Forts on the road between Osgiliath and Minas Tirith.
