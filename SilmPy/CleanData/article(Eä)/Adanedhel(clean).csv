Adanedhel was another name for Túrin, the son of Húrin and Morwen.  Although a Men, he had been raised from childhood in the halls of King Thingol of Doriath.  When, later in his life, he dwelt among the Elves of Nargothrond, they recognised the nobility he had acquired in Thingols kingdom, and gave him the name Adanedhel, meaning Elf-man (Adan means "man" and edhel means "elf")., p. 164
