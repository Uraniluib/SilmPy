Hyarrostar was the wide promontory that spread out to the south and east of Númenor, and in fact contained its easternmost point. Along its southern shores were wide beaches of white sands, and on its western borders, where the shorelands were interrupted by the mouths of the River Siril, stood the township of Nindamos. The Hyarrostar was most famous for its trees, and it held great plantations that provided much of the wood used by Númenors shipwrights.
