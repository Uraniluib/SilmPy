Budgeford was a Hobbits settlement in the Eastfarthing of the Shire, so close to the Brandywine Bridge that it fell in the district known as Bridgefields. It lay on the tributary of the Brandywine known simply as the Water, north of Whitfurrows. The town of Budgeford was the seat of the Bolger Family, an important family among the Shire-hobbits.
==Etymology==
The ford in its name apparently derives from a ford across this stream. On the A Part of the Shire the name is written Budge Ford, perhaps denoting especially the ford.
Budge- was an obscure Hobbitish element of no clear meaning in Westron, believed to be connected to bulge and Bolgers., p. 767 Based on this, David Salo has suggested that the name represents a possible Old English form *Bolgraford "Ford of the Bolgers".
