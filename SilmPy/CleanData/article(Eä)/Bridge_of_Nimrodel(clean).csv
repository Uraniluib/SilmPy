The Bridge of Nimrodel once spanned the river Nimrodel (river) near its meeting with the Celebrant. It was part of the path from Moria into Lothl√≥rien. By the time the Fellowship of the Ring came to the river on 15 January ,, the bridge had long broken down. In the absence of a bridge, Legolas led the party down the deep-cloven bank to wade across the soothing waters.
