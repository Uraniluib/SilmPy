The Fall of Minas Ithil was a battle that occurred in  between the forces of Gondor and Mordor.
After the Downfall of Númenor in , the sons of Elendil brought their ships up the Anduin and together founded the realm of Gondor.  While Anárion set up his house in Minas Anor, his brother Isildur established his house in Minas Ithil in a pass in the Ephel Dúath on the border of Mordor.
But Sauron also escaped the Downfall and returned to Mordor.  There he built up his strength until he could assault the exiled Númenóreans.  In  a great force took Minas Ithil, drove out Isildur, and burnt the White Tree of Gondor.  Isildur escaped with his wife, his sons, and a seedling of the Tree.  They traveled to Elendil in the north while Anárion defended Osgiliath and kept Sauron at bay.
Saurons attack and conquest of Minas Ithil was the spark that touched off the War of the Last Alliance.
