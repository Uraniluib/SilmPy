Dorwinion or Dor-Winion was a land which lay on the north-western shores of the Sea of Rhûn, surrounded by the River Running. In Dorwinion was made a heady wine, which was strong enough to let even Elves get drunk and fall asleep.
==History==
Despite its location in the outskirts of Rhûn, the very name of Dorwinion betrayed an influence by the Elves or the Gondorians, although it cant be said with certainty who inhabited that land. 
What is known is that King of Gondor Turambar (King of Gondor) made conquests in the East, so the lands that was or would be Dorwinion probably became part of Gondor; by the time of Hyarmendacil I Gondor had reached its greatest extent in all its history. In  King Minalcar and Vidugavia of the Northmen also campaigned in the lands between Rhovanion and the Inland Sea. In the following centuries the Great Plague had hit those lands although it is not known how much Dorwinion was affected. 
During the war with the Wainriders (), the borders of Gondor were pushed back to the Emyn Muil. Eventually Gondor withdrew its hold from the lands around Rhûn, and thus Dorwinion.
By  Dorwinion traded with realms of Rhovanion, such as the Woodland Realm. The special wine of Thranduil came from that place in crates. The Elves of Mirkwood returned the crates by way of the Forest River to Lake-town on Long Lake.
==Etymology==
The name is Sindarin meaning "Land of Gwinion", whereas Gwinion itself is a name of a country meaning "Young-land"; from dor and gwain plus the geographical ending -nd., p. 54 The latter part of the name is apparently related to Gnomish words such as gwinwen (“freshness”) and gwion (“young”).
Tolkien commented that the Elvish name in such a remote location is a "testimony to the spread of Sindarin".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Dorvinion or Dor-Winion is mentioned in the The Lay of the Children of Húrin; its wine was famous among the Dwarves of Nogrod and Menegroth. It is said there to lie in the "Burning south" (of Beleriand) lines 223, 425, which might suggest it was a different "Dorwinion", or may just have referred to the fact it came from the more southern lands of  Rhovanion by way of the Dwarf-road of Beleriand. 
While writing the Quenta Silmarillion, Tolkien once mentioned Dorwinion as a location of Tol Eressëa., p. 338 Tolkien reused the name and the wines in The Hobbit, establishing thus that it is somewhere in or near the  Rhovanion.
In annotations to Pauline Baynes, Tolkien suggested the name Mildor meaning "Land of wines", and it was struck out.
==Inspiration==
Based on the meaning of its name, John Rateliff suggests that the name is a reference to the Irish legend of Wikipedia:Tír na nÓg "Land of the Young". However this similarity rather applies to the earlier phase where Dorwinion was mentioned as a part of Tol Eressea.
