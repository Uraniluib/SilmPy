The Tomb of Elendil was the tomb of the first King of Arnor and of Gondor built by Isildur on Eilenaer, the mid-point of the Kingdom while the Kingdom endured.  In an oval lawn upon the summit of the hill, on the eastern side, was placed a low mound which in time became covered with alfirin.  Before the mound was a black stone with the letters lambe, ando, lambe engraved upon it.
Its location was a secret kept for many centuries among the Kings of Gondor and the Stewards of Gondor. At Isildurs command, the hill would be a hallow and none would disturb it other than a heir of Elendil. The King should visit the hallow from time to time, especially when he felt the need of wisdom in days of danger or distress. It was also the place where he should bring his heir full-grown to manhood, and tell him of the making of the hallow and other matters that he should know., (iii) Cirion and Eorl
The Stewards were considered to have the rights and duties of the King, so they too followed this tradition even after the time of Kings, although they visited the place seldomly., (iv) The Tradition of Isildur
On this site, Cirion made his oath of alliance between Gondor and the Éothéod with Eorl.
When Rohan was founded, Cirion judged that the "Tradition of Isildur" was now made void: The hallow was no longer "at the midpoint" and Gondor was not the Kingdom as it was when Isildur spoke. Cirion removed the casket that Isildur had set within the mound and sent it to the Hallows of Minas Tirith.
The green mound remained as the memorial and even when the hill (now known as Amon Anwar) had become a Warning beacons of Gondor, it was still a place of reverence to Gondor and to the Rohirrim, who named it in their own tongue Halifirien, the Holy Mount.
