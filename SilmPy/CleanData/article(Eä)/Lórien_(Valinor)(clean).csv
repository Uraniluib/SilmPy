Lórien (Quenya, pron. ) was a place in Valinor and the home of Irmo and Estë. Due to his close association with the gardens, Irmo is more commonly referred to as Lórien.
Lórien was the most beautiful place in Arda with silver willows, flowers, and lakes. One of those lakes was named Lórellin., p. 239
It was inhabited by singing nightingales and many Spirits (creatures) who served Irmo and Estë. The Eldar, the Maiar, and even the Valar visited the gardens of Lórien to rest and be refreshed by its fountains. Tilion used to dream by the pools of Estë beneath the silver light of Telperion, and Melian used to sing there when the lights of the Two Trees mingled. Before departing for Middle-earth, Melian also tended to the trees that flowered there.
After giving birth to Fëanor, Míriel grew weary of her earthly life. She laid down to rest in Lórien and released her fëa. Manwë ordered that her body be tended by the spirits there, and Finwë waited for her to awaken for many years. Eventually, she refused to return, and the vigil to maintain her hroa was no longer required.
==Etymology==
The name of the place apparently contains the element lor- related to "slumber" and "dream".
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Irmos dwellings were built south of the mountains of Aman. Aulë had created Irmos halls from mist beyond Avathar gathered from the shadowy seas. The halls of Irmo were great and dimly lit, and the expansive gardens came near to the roots of Telperion. "His sprites sang wonderfully in these gardens and the scent of nightflowers and the songs of sleepy nightingales filled them with great loveliness." Poppies also grew there, which Irmo used in enchantments. Yavanna had given Irmo a great many yew trees, cedars, and pines that "exuded drowsy odours in the dusk," and these trees grew near deep pools of water. Glowworms crept about the borders of the pools, and "Varda had set stars within their depths for the pleasure of Lórien." 
Within his gardens, a ring of tall, shadowy cypress trees surrounded the deep cauldron Silindrin, which held the collected dew of Teleperion. It was set upon a bed of pearls, and while its light remained, he could descry many visions.
