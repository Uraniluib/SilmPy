Calenhir was a river in Gondor that flowed east from the Pinnath Gelin into the Morthond.  Its name seems to mean "Green River" in Sindarin (from calen "green", calen and sir "river", s»ãr).
On the "working map" that J.R.R. Tolkien used while writing The Lord of the Rings the river was drawn on the map but only named in the list of the "Rivers of Gondor"., West, p. 434  This river did not appear in the maps of the published Lord of the Rings or the Unfinished Tales and therefore is non-canonical.
