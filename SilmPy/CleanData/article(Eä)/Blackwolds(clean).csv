File:Blackwold1.jpg.The Blackwolds were a group of Men brigands created for The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar. 
Nothing is known about the origins of the Blackwolds. Yet, it is implied that they were a group of Men from Bree-land that broke their ties with the rest of the free peoples. It is not stated what motivated them to do so.
The group was led by William Skunkwood who allied it with the forces of Angmar. After Williams death, Éogan took over leadership of the group. He too was slain. After his death the Blackwolds broke apart and severed their ties with Angmar.
==History==
The Blackwolds helped Nazgûl find the Hobbits who is carrying the One Ring. The Nazgûl did not inform them why they were looking for the Hobbit nor did they give a description of the Hobbit, only that the last name was Baggins Family. They managed to capture Mundo Sackville-Baggins while he was staying at Archet. Just when they were attempting to transport him away for questioning, the Rangers of the North Amdir (Shadows of Angmar) freed him. Mundo along with his friend Celandine Brandybuck managed to burn their camp as they escaped. 
The Blackwolds regrouped and with the help of Calder Cob they planned a direct attack on the town of Archet. Along with Éogan the Blackwolds managed to set the town on fire. They captured Mundo again, but learned that he wasnt carrying the treasure they were looking for. They quickly retreated, but managed to destroy half of Archet in their assault.
