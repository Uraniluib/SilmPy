Lethuin is a Silvan Elves Elves of the Woodland Realm in the The Hobbit (film series), portrayed by Eli Kent.
===History===
Lethuin helped capture Thorin and Company while they were in Mirkwood, and was later seen in the cellar conversing with Galion while Bilbo Baggins was searching for a means of helping the Dwarves escape.
===Etymology===
Lethuin is obviously an anagram of the canonical name LÃºthien (the same way certain other background characters were given names of that nature throughout the Peter Jackson films). However, there is no actual background or etymology behind it.
