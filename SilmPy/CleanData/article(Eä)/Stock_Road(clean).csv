The Stock Road was a road in the Shire.
It begun from the village of Stock, passed through the Woody End and the Green Hills.
At the end of the Third Age (22 September, ), Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee met the Keepers of the Three Rings in Woody End, waiting on the Stock Road.
==Identification==
The road is not marked on the map A Part of the Shire. However there is an unnamed road joining Tuckborough with Stock through Green Hill Country and Woody End. Karen Fonstad identifies this road as the Stock Road.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 71, The Shire
According to Robert Foster, the Stock Road joined the Great East Road west of Bywater but no such road does so on said map.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 365, entry "Stock Road"
