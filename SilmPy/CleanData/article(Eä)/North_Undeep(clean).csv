The North Undeep was one of two westward bends of the river Anduin located between The Wold and the Brown Lands (the other being the South Undeep).  The upper part of the North Undeep also bordered the Field of Celebrant and was where the river Limlight joined the Great River.  Both of the Undeeps had many shallows and wide shoals that afforded an easy crossing for armies, which occurred a number of times during the history of Gondor and Rohan.
