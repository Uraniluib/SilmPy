Rúmil was a Lambengolmor ("Loremaster") of the Noldor, living in the city of Tirion. 
==History==
Rúmil was notable for inventing writing. His alphabet was called Sarati, as each letter was called a sarat. This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor as the Tengwar. He was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Valinor he was first to discover just how the Telerin language differed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya.
It is assumed that Rúmil was one of the Noldor who refused the summons of Fëanor, because he stopped writing his part of Annals of Valinor with the return to Valinor of those Noldor, led by Finarfin..
==Works==
Rúmil was said to be the author of various works, some of which would find The Silmarillion after they were translated into Westron by Bilbo Baggins. These include:
* Ainulindalë
* The Annals of Aman
* Lhammas
* Lhammasethen
* Ambarkanta
* i Equessi Rumilo
Pengolodh of Gondolin, when arrived to Valinor, later continued and completed much of his work.
==Etymology==
The only thing known about the name Rúmil is that it is Quenya., pp. 51, 54
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales, an Elf of Tol Eressea named Rúmil narrates to Eriol the creation of Arda by Ilúvatar and the Ainur; this mirrors Rúmils connection to the Ainulindale tale.
