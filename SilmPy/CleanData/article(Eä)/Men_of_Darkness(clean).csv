Men of Darkness or Men of Shadow were the men of the east of Middle-earth who fell under the dominion of Morgoth in the First Age or who later opposed the Dúnedain and were dominated by Sauron.
The Dúnedain used the term for those peoples who were not simply barbaric plunderers or brigands, but fanatically opposed the Realms in Exile, and their allies.
The following peoples can be considered Men of Darkness:
*Easterlings (Wainriders, Balchoth)
*Axe-Men
*The slaves of Nurn
*Variags
*Black Númenóreans and Corsairs of Umbar
*Half-trolls
*Haradrim
*Dunlendings
*Hill-men
