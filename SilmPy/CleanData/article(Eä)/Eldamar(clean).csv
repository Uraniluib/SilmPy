Eldamar was the land of the Elves in Aman, which encompassed the Calacirian, the coastal area east of the Pelóri, and Tol Eressëa.  The main settlements of the Elves in this region were Tirion, Alqualondë, and Avallónë.
==Etymology==
Eldamar means "Elvenhome" in Quenya,, p. 20 composed of eldar ("High-elves") and már ("home").
==Other versions of the legendarium==
An early name for the region was Eglamar (disambiguation), having the same meaning as Eldamar (Egla being the Gnomish form of the later Eldar)., p. 189
==Inspiration==
The name is a direct translation of the mythological Wikipedia:Álfheimr (lit. "Elf-home") meaning "Elfland, Faery".
