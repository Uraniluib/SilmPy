The Vale of Narog was the valley of the swift-running River Narog cut southwards through West Beleriand from the rivers sources beneath Ered Wethrin in the north. For the first half of the rivers journey, the Vale passed through the high moorlands west of Doriath, through lands that were ruled from Nargothrond, and past the field of Tumhalad where Nargothronds last battle was fought. 
As the river plunged into the rocky lands beneath Taur-en-Faroth, its valley became much steeper and narrower, until the river emerged to flow across the lowlands of West Beleriand and ran on to meet Sirion at Nan-tathren.
