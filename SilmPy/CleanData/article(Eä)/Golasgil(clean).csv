Golasgil was the lord of Anfalas during the War of the Ring.
==History==
Golasgil led a long line of men to Minas Tirith before the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household.  However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg it appears that he did survive the great battle.
