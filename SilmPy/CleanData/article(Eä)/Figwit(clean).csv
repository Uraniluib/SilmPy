Figwit (also known as Aegnor and Elf Escort) is the fan-derived name for an Elves extra in Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings (film series). He soared into a popularity far exceeding his place in the movies when he was perceived as an extremely beautiful character by female fans - and some slash writers. He is played by Bret McKenzie, who also portrayed Lindir in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
==Role==
Figwit is seen in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring during the Council of Elrond. He sits next to Aragorn until they all stand up to argue. After Frodo shouts "I will take it!" and everyone turns and looks at him, Figwit is standing on the far right. He is standing in the background for only a fraction of a second; a main part of the joke is that the actor is just a minor extra.  
Figwit returns in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has the vision about her future son Eldarion. Figwit is the one that tells her to get back with the others. His exact words: "Lady Arwen, we cannot delay!" and then "My lady!".
==Fandom==
Figwits rise to fame began shortly after the first movie, and some fans believe he was given dialog in the third movie because Peter Jackson was aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition): "the decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them."
===Figwits "brother"===
Figwit has a lesser known "brother", played by extra Blair Morton. "Meorof", Mystery Elf On (the) Right Of Figwit, appears, well, to Figwits right in the Council of Elrondhttp://www.theargonath.cc/characters/meorof/meorof.html.
==Alternate names==
The name Figwit is a humorous acronym by fans, and stands for "Frodo Baggins is great - who is THAT?!?". 
However the name has also appeared in official material of the movie franchise: once on an autograph card, and once on a card for Arwen; both these cards are by Topps. 
In the credits of The Return of the King, he is called Elf Escort, and his Decipher Card gives the name Aegnor, a name derived from The Silmarillion. 
In fanfiction, Figwit is sometimes called Melpomaen, a shoddy translation of the elements "fig" (melpo in Qenya) and "wit" (maen in Noldorin)http://www.figwitlives.net/faq.htm# FigwitLives FAQ.
Bret McKenzies character in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is Lindir, who shares similarities with Figwit. Both are dark-haired Elves of Rivendell and courtiers of Elrond. It is unclear if the two characters are intended to be the same, which would establish a "canon" name for Figwit.
==Other media==
In 2004 a 50 minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon, http://www.enzedff.co.nz/filmsynopsis.asp?FilmID=1802&Archive=0&RegionID=1&EventID=8 "Frodo is great... Who is that?!!", was made by three Wellington filmmakers Stan Alley, Nick Booth and Hannah Clarke - all of whom worked on Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to Edinburgh where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and "elvish good looks" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as Peter Jackson, Barry Osbourne, Mark Ordesky, Ian McKellen and other cast members.
