File:Alan Lee - Barrels out of Bond.jpgThe Forest River was a great river that flowed through northern Mirkwood. It began in the Grey Mountains far to the north and then flowed south-east, joined by the Enchanted River near Thranduils caverns, until it met the River Running at Lake-town in the Long Marshes.
The river was used by the Raft-elves to carry their goods. This river was used by the Dwarves to escape through the barrels.

2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:The Forest River was used by the Dwarves to escape from the Elvenkings Halls in barrels. The Elves, led by Legolas, gave chase, but Bolg and his orcs attacked them. As the Dwarves were not boxed in the barrels and merely used them to stay afloat, they could fight back against the orcs with whatever weapons they could find. Kíli was injured by a Morgul arrow when he tried to open a sluice gate in the river.
