The Sea of Rhûn was a large lake or sea in northern Middle-earth that lay east of Rhovanion on the western borders of Rhûn. The Kine of Araw were found in the fields of Rhûn near the Inland Sea.
==Geography==
The Sea of Rhûn covered roughly 400 square miles (1,000 km&sup2;). The River Running flowed from the north-west into an arm of the sea. West of the Sea of Rhûn was the land of Dorwinion, and roughly 200 miles (300 km) to the south was the eastern end of the Ered Lithui.
A forest stood at the north-eastern shore of the sea, and near the south-western shore there were many hills. The south-eastern part of the Sea was occupied by a small wooded island.
==History==
In the Years of the Trees during the time of the Great Journey, the craft of ship-making practised by the Teleri reached new heights in their efforts to traverse the Sea of Rhûn on their westward journey. pp. 391-392
In the First Age, the shores of the Inland Sea were populated by tribes of Men who were migrating to the West. The House of Bëor arrived there first and dwelt at the feet of the nearby hills. The House of Hador came later in the north-east woods near the shores. The Men crafted boats and could sail the sea, but they did not meet often, and their languages soon diverged before they resumed their journey to Beleriand.
In the early Third Age, the Kings of Gondor such as Rómendacil I campaigned to those lands, and Turambar (King of Gondor) expanded the kingdom to the East. By the time of King Hyarmendacil I, the Inland Sea formed one of the boundaries of Gondor.
Vorondil hunted the Kine of Araw near the shores of the Sea.
During the time of Rómendacil II, the Inland Sea was apparently within the borders of the power of Gondor.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the drafts for the Lord of the Rings, the sea was called "Sea of Rhûnaer". In the earlier maps, part of the Sea was occupied by a heavily wooded island. In the published maps by Christopher Tolkien, the island is replaced by a dotted pattern. The reason for this change and what it signifies was never specified by C. Tolkien. There is no trace of the unnamed island in Pauline Bayness A Map of Middle-earth.
Also in these early maps, Tolkien indicated that Neldoreth was the name of the forest bordering the Sea of Rhûns north-eastern shore. This forest went unnamed in later maps., p. 307
==Theories==
Christopher Tolkien and others have speculated whether or not the Sea of Rhûn can "...be identified with the Sea of Helcar, vastly shrunken". p. 174. Karen Wynn Fonstad adopted this position in making The Atlas of Middle-earth. However, in The Peoples of Middle-earth, there are references to the Sea of Rhûn and its surrounding geographical landmarks existing as far back as the Years of the Trees at the time of the Great Journey, far to the west of where the Elves awoke near Sea of Helcar.
