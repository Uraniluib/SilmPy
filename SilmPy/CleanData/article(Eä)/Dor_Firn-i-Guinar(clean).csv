Dor Firn-i-Guinar, the Land of the Dead that Live, was the name given by the Eldar to the region surrounding the isle of Tol Galen in southern Ossiriand, where Beren and Lúthien lived after their return from the dead. It is told that the country was exceptionally beautiful, even reminding of the blessed land of Valinor.
==Etymology==
Dor Firn-i-Guinar is the name appearing in the published The Silmarillion, apparently consisting of the Sindarin elements dor "land" + firn "dead" + in "who, that" + cuinar "live".http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth at http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com (accessed 10 November 2011)
In his manuscripts, J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with many variations on how to translate Land of the Dead that Live: I·Cuilwarthon, I·Guilwarthon, Cuilwarthien, Gwerth-i-cuina, and Gwerth-i-guinar. (entries for Land of the Dead that Live) In a 1972 letter, Tolkien used the name Dor Gyrth i chuinar., p. 417
