Narvi (mid-Second Age) was a great Dwarves craftsman.
==History==
Narvi lived in Moria during the height of its glory. He formed a friendship with the Noldor-lord Celebrimbor, the master artificer of neighboring Eregion. Together they made the mighty Doors of Durin that guarded the West-gate of Moria of the Dwarven city.
==Etymology==
In drafts of The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien used the spelling Narfi., p. 188 Wikipedia:Narfi is an Old Norse name and character appearing in the Prose Edda (there also spelled Narvi), and the meaning of the name is unknown.Jim Allan, "Giving of Names", in An Introduction to Elvish, p. 223
Possibly the name is provided as a translation of the Dwarfs "outer" name from some Mannish language of the Northmen of the Second Age.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In a linguistic manuscript, J.R.R. Tolkien placed the character Narvi at an earlier time in the history of Arda (apparently because of linguistic considerations), "before Durins death"., p. 38
