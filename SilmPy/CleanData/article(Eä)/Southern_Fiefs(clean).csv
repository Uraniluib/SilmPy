The Southern Fiefs or Outlands of Gondor were the provinces of the South-kingdom. 
These seaboard lands along the Bay of Belfalas provided much of Minas Tiriths needs: fish from the Ethir Anduin, :Category:Flowers from Lossarnach, and at earlier times, stone from Anórien. The fiefs also provided skilled soldiers. 
By the late Third Age, most regions of Gondor were either deserted or overrun and only the Southern Fiefs remained. During the War of the Ring, the Outlands are under attack from the south by a large army of Corsairs of Umbar, allies of Mordor, and they sent small reinforcements to Minas Tirith.
The Southern Fiefs were:
* Dor-en-Ernil
* Lossarnach
* Lebennin
* Belfalas
* Ethir Anduin
* Lamedon
* Anfalas and the Pinnath Gelin
* Blackroot Vale
* Ringló Vale
==Etymology==
