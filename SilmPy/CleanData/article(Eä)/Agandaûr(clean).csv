He assembled an army in Fornost of Orcs of the Misty Mountains.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue In Fornost he took Tharzog, chieftain of the Orcs of Mount Gram, into his service and passed his knowledge of sorcery to the Orcs.
Just shortly after the Nazgûl defeated the Rangers of the North at Sarn Ford, Agandaûr met there with the Witch-king. Telling him he had finished the preparations and was ready to attack, as assistance for the Nine Riders in the Hunt of the Ring. The Witch-king ordered him to return and attack immediately.
After his return to Fornost his soldiers captured a Eagles, named Beleram, who was spying on his forces. On Aragorns order Eradan (video game character), a Dúnedain, Andriel, an Elves loremaster from Rivendell, and Farin (video game character), a Dwarves from Lonely Mountain, infiltrated Fornost to stop the army of Orcs from joining the Nazgûl. When they found the chained Eagle, they helped him to escape.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Main Gate When they met with two more infiltrators, Elladan and Elrohir, they formed a team to kill Agandaûr.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Inner Wards After they fought a way to the citadel tower Eradan, Andriel and Farin dealt with Tharzog while Elladan and Elrohir confronted Agandaûr. Tharzog was killed but Agandaûr had the upper hand in his battle with the Half-elves. However, when the Half-elves where joined by Eradan, Andriel and Farin, he fled on the back of a Fell beast. Even though Beleram pursued him in the air, Agandaûr escaped the Eagles clutches by summoning a thunder storm.
==Inspiration==
Agandaurs conversation with Urgost appears to be based on that of Dain and the man from Mordor mentioned in The Council of Elrond.
