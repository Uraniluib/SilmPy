Stock was a town in the north of the Marish, lying on the Stock-brook stream near to the banks of the River Brandywine and south of the Brandywine Bridge in the Eastfarthing of the Shire. Stock was the meeting point of the Causeway, which traversed the town, and a road that led to Tuckborough to the west. The Golden Perch in Stock was said to have the finest beer in the Eastfarthing.
During Frodo Baggins journey to Buckland, Frodo announced that he wished to straight across country to the Bucklebury Ferry.  Peregrin Took objected to the short cut, and mentioned the Golden Perch.  The hobbits avoided Stock in order to keep Pippin away from there and prevent their journey from being delayed.
