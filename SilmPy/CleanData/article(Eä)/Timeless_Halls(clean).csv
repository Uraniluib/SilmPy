The Timeless Halls are the dwelling of Ilúvatar, as distinct from the Void. They have existed before and outside the boundaries of the Eä, and may or may not have a physical form. Although without limit, they are said to stretch from the Abyss to the Firmament.
In Bilbo Baggins Song of Eärendil, the Ilmarin of Manwë and Varda are referred to as "The Timeless Halls."
