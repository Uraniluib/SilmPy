The Fragrant Trees were those species of trees which grew in Nísimaldar, a western region in the Island of Númenor. The name derived from the sweet scent which came from their leaves, their flowers and even their bark. They were brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves who navigated towards Númenor. Later, they were planted in other regions of the island, though they did not grow in such high numbers.
The Fragrant Trees were: Oiolairë, Lairelossë, Nessamelda, Vardarianna, Taniquelassë, Yavannamírë and Malinornë.
