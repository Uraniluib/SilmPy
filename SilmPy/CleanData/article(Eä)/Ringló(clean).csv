__NOTOC__
The Ringló (Sindarin"cold fenland") was an important river of the central regions of Gondor. It arose in the White Mountains in a valley in the eastern part of Lamedon and flowed south-west for some 200 miles before joining the Morthond near Cobas Haven., West The Ciril was a major tributary of the Ringló that entered it from the north.
==History==
Near the confluence of the Ringló and the Morthond was the ancient Elf-haven of Edhellond. This refuge had been founded at the beginning of the Second Age by a remnant of Elves from Doriath., Amroth and Nimrodel When first discovered by the Númenóreans the river was named Ringnen ("cold water"); later changed to Ringló when its upper reaches were explored.
After the founding of Gondor, the Ringló served as the boundary between Anfalas to the west and Belfalas to the east.
At the time of the War of the Ring the lord of Ringló Vale was Dervorin. His son marched to Minas Tirith with a company of three hundred men to aid in the citys defence. On 10 March  Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, the Grey Company, and the Oathbreakers crossed the Ringló on their way from Erech to Pelargir.
==Etymology==
The name Ringló was composed of the elements Ring, meaning "cold, chill",, ring and ló (earlier loga), meaning "fenland". The second element referred to the fact that at its source the Ringló came from a shallow lake fed by a high snowfield in the White Mountains., Ringló
==Other versions of the legendarium==
The course and placement of the Ringló varied greatly as J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings. In the First Map of Middle-earth the Ringló flowed to the sea and the Morthond was set well west of it (and Dol Amroth was far to the west of both). When he developed Outline VI for Book V in The Return of the King he drew a map that showed the Morthond east of the Ringló and the Ringló mostly flowed south to the Sea. When Tolkien made the detailed Second Map there were four rivers – Calenhir, Morthond, Kiril (later Ciril), and Ringló – that flowed independently until they all met just before exiting into Cobas Haven.
