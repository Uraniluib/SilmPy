The High Fells of Rhudaur is a location of Middle-earth that only exists in the Peter Jackson movie trilogy of The Hobbit (film series). It is where the Nazg√ªl were buried and is described more as a dungeon than as a grave.
During the meeting of the White Council in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, it was first mentioned by Lady Galadriel as the location where the Witch-king of Angmar (along with his Morgul-knife) was buried after Angmar fell. She said that the Men of the North took his body and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High Fells and  powerful spells were put by the Elves, as it is implied by Elrond. A place that is said to be so dark, that it would never come to light.
In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Gandalf and Radagast go to investigate the High Fells, revealing that it is also the location where the other Ringwraiths were buried. The Wizards find all the crypts are broken open from the inside. After learning that the Nine have returned to Sauron, Radagast persuades Gandalf, who wished to rejoin Thorin and Company at that point, to investigate the ruins of Dol Guldur.
