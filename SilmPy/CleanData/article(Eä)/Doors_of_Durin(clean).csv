The Doors of Durin, also known as the West-gate, the West-door of Moria, or Elven Door, were built into the Walls of Moria in the dark cliffs of the Celebdil, and formed the western entrance to the great Dwarves city of Moria.
==History==
The main entrance to Moria was the Great Gates in Dimrill Dale, east of the Misty Mountains. During the Second Age, it was decided to open a way to the west side of the Silvertine, which would facilitate contact and cooperation with the Elves realm of Hollin.
The Elven Door was constructed in cooperation between Dwarves and Elves, sometime between  and . It was the two greatest craftsmen of the Second Age, the Noldor and Lord of Eregion, Celebrimbor, and the Dwarves Narvi who built the Doors.
These were the days before the Dark Years of Saurons dominion in Middle-earth, and the friendship between Elven and Dwarven kingdoms was a rare and special event. During this peaceful time the Doors stood open, allowing unfettered trade. But during the War of the Elves and Sauron (in ) the Doors were sealed shut after Sack of Eregion to Saurons forces.
When Khazad-dûm was abandoned in  the way of opening the Doors was forgotten.
At some point between  and  the Wizard Gandalf entered the city looking for King Thráin who had disappeared on journey to Erebor. After his search the Wizard exited through the Doors; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.
In , during the settling of Balins Colony, they were attacked by an onslaught of orcs. Óin led a group to the west side of the city hoping to find escape through the Doors of Durin, but instead he found the water up to the doors where the Watcher in the Water killed him. The Dwarves were trapped, and wiped out.
In August  Gollum took refuge in Moria; but when he had at last discovered the way to the Doors he could not get out.
On 13 January  the Fellowship of the Ring entered Moria through the Doors, but initially Gandalf could not find out the password to open them. Meriadoc Brandybuck unknowingly gave Gandalf the answer by asking, "What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?" When Gandalf realized that the correct translation was "Say friend and enter" he sprang up, laughed, and said "Mellon", which means "friend" in Sindarin, and the Doors opened. Shortly thereafter, the Watcher in the Water attacked the Fellowship and shut the Doors behind them.
==Appearance==

They were fashioned as flush doors, the jambs invisible to the eye, and matched so perfectly with the mountain rock that when closed the Doors could not be seen. The slabs were made by Narvi out of a grey material stronger than stone, and inlaid by Celebrimbor with ithildin, which could only be seen in starlight and moonlight.
When visible, the fine silver-like inlay showed a hammer and anvil (the emblems of Durin), a crown and Seven Stars (probably Durins Crown), two trees surmounted by crescent moons (probably symbolizing the Galathilion), and a single star (the emblem of the House of Fëanor). On the top left and right corners there were the tengwar Calma (C) and Óre (N) standing for Celebrimbor and Narvi; between their feet was an Ando (D) for Durin.
The inscription on the Wikipedia:Archivolt read:
"Ennyn Durin Aran Moria. Pedo Mellon a Minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin."
As Gandalf first translated it to the other Walkers:
"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."
Actually, the inscription gave the password that would cause the Doors to swing open. Gandalfs translation is correct, but the proper translation of the second sentence, also correct, is "Say friend and enter."
From the inside the Doors could be opened by simply pushing against them, though it usually took the thrust of two to do so. When Moria was inhabited by the Dwarves they kept doorwards inside who would help open the Doors and see that only those with permission could pass., Note 12
==An Inconsistency==
The name Moria means "Black Chasm" and was a derogatory description of the place which the Dwarves did not like, and was given after Durins Bane took over the city in the Third Age. It is therefore a mystery why that name appears on an inscription made in the Second Age, and made in consent with the Dwarves.
