The Party Tree was the tree in the center of Party Field south of Bag End. On preparation of the Bilbos Farewell Party, a pavilion was erected that was large enough to accommodate it and it stood at the head of the main table during the celebration with lanterns hanging from its branches. Bilbo stood underneath the Tree when he announced he would be leaving the Shire.
By November of  the Party Tree had been cut down by Sharkey and his men and was lying on the field.  After the Scouring of the Shire, in place of the Tree, Sam planted the silver nut from the Sams garden box given to him by Galadriel. In the spring of , the sapling of a mallorn tree emerged; it was the only mallorn between the Misty Mountains and the Belegaer, and people came from miles around to gaze upon it.
