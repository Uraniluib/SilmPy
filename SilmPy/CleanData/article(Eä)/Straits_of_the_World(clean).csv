The Straits of the World was a strait of mountainous land linking the Great Gulf with the Sea of Helcar in the First Age of the world. p. 259 The Straits of the World appears only in early writings p. 259 before Tolkien envisioned the wide lands of Eriador, Gondor, and Mordor that lay east of the Great Gulf.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
Karen Wynn Fonstad speculated in The Atlas of Middle-earth that the Sea of Helcar drained into the Great Gulf at the end of the First Age and that the Straits of the World became the river Poros. Fonstands interpretation was predicated on the idea that Mordor was created in the Second Age where the Sea of Helcar once lay. However, in The Peoples of Middle-earth (which was published after Fontstads Atlas), Melkor was said to have created Mount Doom in Mordor during the "long First Age". p. 390 (note 14) Additionally, it is told in Unfinished Tales that the migration of the Drúedain from Hildórien brought them westward through lands south of Mordor., pp. 339-340
