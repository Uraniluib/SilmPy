The Esgaliant or Iant Iaur as it became known in later days, was a bridge over the Esgalduin.
The bridge was great and made of stone, part of the great road that ran north of Doriath and connected Brithiach to Arossiach.
==History==
The Bridge of Esgalduin was made long before Morgoth came to Beleriand, perhaps by Dwarves., entry "Iant Iaur"
After terror entered the Ered Gorgoroth and the land to its south became deserted, the road and bridge fell into decay, and it was referred to as Iant Iaur, the Old Bridge.
==Etymology==
Iant Iaur means "Old Bridge", from iant "bridge" and iaur "old".
