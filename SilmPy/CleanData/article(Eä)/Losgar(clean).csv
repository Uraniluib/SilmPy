Losgar was a place at the mouth of the Firth of Drengist, in Lammoth, the cold lands northwest of Beleriand. 
It was here that Fëanor landed during the Long Night with the stolen swan-ships of the Falmari, and gave the order to burn them, to force the host of Fingolfin and Finrod to march across the deadly Helcaraxë. According to a legend, another reason to do so was to prevent some Noldor from turning back, such as his own som Amrod, who was uncomfortable with his fathers deeds. Amrod died as he was still sleeping inside the first ship burned.
