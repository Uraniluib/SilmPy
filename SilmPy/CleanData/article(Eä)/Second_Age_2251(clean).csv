In the Appendix B, it said in 2251 "Tar-Atanamir takes the Sceptre of Númenor", however, Atanamir died in .  The year 2221 is itself an emendation of 2251, and the former (2221) appears in the later tables, while the latter (2251) in the earlier tables: therefore 2251 (properly 2221) should have read "Death of Tar-Atanamir. Tar-Ancalimon takes the sceptre"., Note 10
