Musical instruments of different types appear in the legendarium.
==Dwarven musical instruments==
Among the Dwarves, several types of instruments are recorded in the stories from Middle-earth. Thorin and Company played the following instruments at the An Unexpected Party at Bag End:

*Wikipedia:drum (played by Bombur)
*Wikipedia:clarinet (played by Bifur and Bofur)
*Wikipedia:viol (played by Dwalin and Balin)
