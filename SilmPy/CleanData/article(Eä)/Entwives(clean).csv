Entwives were the mates of the Ents. The Entwives were dedicated to Yavanna. They had gardens in the regions later known as the Brown Lands, and their agricultural knowledge was passed on to Men and Hobbits.
==History==
During the First Age or the Second Age they started to move farther away from the male Ents because they liked to plant and control small things like vegetables, grass and flowers, while the male Ents tended the larger trees of the great forest. The Entwives passed eastward over the Anduin and went to the region that would later become the Brown Lands. After Morgoth was overthrown, their gardens blossomed and they taught agriculture to the primitive Men and they honored them.
When Sauron burned that region to stop the advance of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men down the Anduin, the Entwives were likely wiped out, although some might have been captured and enslaved as agricultural workers or have escaped into the east of Middle-earth. The Ents held that the Entwives were lost.
Treebeard would tell Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took that the Entwives would love their country. Indeed sometime before the War of the Ring, Halfast Gamgee claimed that he saw an Elms-like "Tree-Man" walking in the North Moors. However, it was never learned whether the "Tree-Man" was an Ent, an Entwife, or just a story.
==Background==
One of the primary daggers on the survival of the Entwives is found in Letter 144 of The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien:
 – ) when Sauron pursued a scorched earth policy and burned their land against the advance of the Allies down the Anduin...}}
In 2017, a Wikipedia:Quora user named Pip Willis published a partial image of a map he claimed his father drew and shared with J.R.R. Tolkien in 1971. Willis alleges that Tolkien wrote on the map "Here may be Entwives", in an area on the east bank a southern bow of the river Carnen, flowing into the Sea of Rhûn.
