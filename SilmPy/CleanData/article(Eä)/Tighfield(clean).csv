Tighfield was a village or town located somewhere in the Shire.Tighfields location is unknown as it is not included in the published map A Part of the Shire. It was the home of several families, specifically Gamwich Family (later Gammidge Family) and Roper Family. 
Wiseman Gamwich came to Tighfield about two hundred years before the War of the Ring, and Wisemans son Hob Gammidge is recorded as a roper, one of a long line of Tighfield rope-makers., Table S2 Rise of the Family of Gardners of the Hill, p. 115
Hobs son Hobson Gamgee, and in turn his son Andwise Roper, were said to have practised their craft in a Wikipedia:ropewalk (that is, a rope-makers yard) for many years.
Hobs grandson was Gaffer Gamgee, Sams father, who left Tighfield for Hobbiton, to start a new life as a gardener.
==Etymology==
Tighfields name is associated with the tradition of rope-making there and contains an old word for "rope" (see English "tie", whose spelling was assimilated to verb "tie"). It was the site of a rope-makers yard, also called "rope-walk" because the ropes were stretched out in long lines over trestles at intervals.
J.R.R. Tolkien notes the modern place-name elements tigh, teigh, tye, tey which are unrelated; they mean "an enclosed piece of land" and do not occur as the first element in a compound.
Tolkien also noted that the term "rope-walk" in the text has confused several of his translators, to the point of imagining rope bridges., p. 777
