Seregon was a plant that grew in rocky soil and produced blood-red flowers, which gave it its name. Seregon was noted as the one plant that mantled the otherwise barren head of Amon Rûdh.
In the First Age, Túrin was the captain of the Gaurwaith, an outlaw band, that was seeking a new lair when they captured Mîm the Petty-dwarves.  In return for his life Mîm led the Men to his home, which was carved into the summit of Amon Rûdh.  As they approached the secret hideout from the north, sunlight from the west illuminated the hill and its rich, red flowers, causing the outlaw Andróg to exclaim, "See! There is blood on the hill-top".
Mîm later betrayed Túrin and his followers to a party of Orcs.  The Orcs attacked the hideout and killed all but Túrin and his elf-friend Beleg.  The blood of the rest of the outlaws flowed out upon the seregon.
