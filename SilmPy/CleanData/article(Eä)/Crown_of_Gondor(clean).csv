The Crown of Gondor, also called the winged crown, White Crown, Silver Crown and the crown of Elendil, was the ceremonial headgear of the Kings of Gondor of Gondor, and was used as a symbol of the Kingship.  
==Description==
It is said that the original crown was a plain Númenóreans war-helm. However a later crown replaced it, described as a tall, jeweled and winged helm, not unlike the helms of the Guards of the Citadel, but taller and all white, with wings resembling those of a sea-bird wrought of pearl and silver. Seven gems of adamant were set in the circlet. On its summit was a jewel, the light of which went up like a flame to represent Anarion.
==History==
File:Matěj Čadil - Meneldil of Gondor.jpg, the first King of Gondor after Isildur
The original crown of Gondor was said to be a plain Númenórean war-helm, the one worn by the Númenórean Kings in the Battle of Dagorlad; as Anárions helm was crushed when he was killed, the war-helm of Isildur was used for the crowning of the Kings of Gondor.
In the days of Atanatar II Alcarin this was replaced by a jewelled helm.
Before replying to the challenge of the Witch-king, Eärnur put the Crown of ElendilThe naming "crown of Elendil" in App. A is curious, considering the tradition that it consisted of Isildurs war-helm, later to be replaced by a newer one during Atanatar IIs reign lay in the lap of King Eärnil II in the houses of the dead and it remained there even after his loss, for nearly a thousand years.
On 1 May  the rightful heir (Aragorn Telcontar) came forward to receive the crown.  The tradition had been for a new king to receive the crown from the hands of his father (or to obtain it from his fathers tomb), but Faramir brought forth the casket with the ancient Crown and gave it to Aragorn.  After chanting "Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien.  Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn Ambar-metta!" Aragorn surprised the crowd by returning the crown to Faramir.  At his request, Frodo Baggins took the crown and bore it to Gandalf, who placed it on King Elessars head with the blessing, "Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!"
In the year  Aragorn went to the House of the Kings to lay down his life.  In that place he bade farewell to his son Eldarion and, following tradition, gave him the Crown of Gondor.
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien described it in his letters as being similar to the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedjet crown of the Pharaohs of Egypt. He writes "I think the crown of Gondor (the S. Kingdom) was very tall, like that of Egypt, but with wings attached, not set straight back but at an angle.", p. 281
