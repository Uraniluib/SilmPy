Herblore of the Shire was a book written by Meriadoc Brandybuck, one of several treatises he authored after his return from the War of the Ring. 
The book discussed the origins and history of the Hobbits art of smoking Pipe-weed, tracing it back through Tobold Hornblower (who introduced it to the Shire) to its ultimate origins in Middle-earth, in the lands along the southern banks of the Anduin.
