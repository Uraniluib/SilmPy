== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In earlier versions of the Silmarillion as detailed in The History of Middle-earth series, Mîm was a much more evil character, who actively betrayed Túrin., footnote, p. 148 But as Dwarves gradually changed in Tolkiens writings from evil Orc-like beings to the Dwarves they later became, Mîms character was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true villain, but almost a tragic character in his own right.
