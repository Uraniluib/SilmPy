Inglor Felagund was an older, rejected name for Finrod. It makes a relic appearance in The Lord of the Rings, in the form of "Gildor".
==Finrod==
In earlier versions of the legendarium, until the era of the first edition of The Lord of the Rings, the name "Finrod" was given to the character later known as Finarfin. Finrod was at the time known as Inglor Felagund. 
The name however was survived in the patronym Inglorion and perhaps in the Quenya form Ingalaurë. The character with the name Inglorion in The Lord the Rings Gildor, although a fellow Noldo, was  unrelated to Finrod and certainly not his son. Finrod, as seen in The Silmarillion, was unmarried and childless because his lover, Amarië of the Vanyar, did not follow him to Middle-earth.
==Etymology==
Inglor in the early appearances was interpreted as "heart-gold" (Sundocarmës IND and G-LOR). 
Although the name Inglor(ion) is not analyzed in the later works, there is a similarity to Finarfins Amilessë, Ingalaurë. Therefore according to the more recent background, Inglor could be the sindarization of that name, having a new etymology and meaning ("Vanya-gold").
