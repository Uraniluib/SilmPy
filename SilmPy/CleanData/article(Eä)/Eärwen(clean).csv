__NOTOC__


== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In the published The Silmarillion, Orodreth is the son of Finarfin and Eärwen. This was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien, and an admitted mistake. Orodreth is actually Eärwens grandson, the son of her child Angrod.
The family-tree of Elwë shows only Eärwen as a child of Olwë. However, in the text she is said to have brothers, whose names are not mentioned in the narrative.
