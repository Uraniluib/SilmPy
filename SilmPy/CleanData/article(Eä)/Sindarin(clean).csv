Sindarin was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth in the Third Age. 
==History==
Sindarin was the language of the Sindar, those Teleri which had been left behind on the Great Journey of the Elves. It was derived from an earlier language called Common Telerin. When the Noldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin language, although they believed their native Quenya more beautiful. Before the downfall, most of the Men of Númenor also knew the language, though the common language there was Adûnaic. Knowledge of it was kept in the Númenóreans realms-in-exile Arnor and Gondor, especially amongst the learned. While Westron (descended from Adûnaic) became the most common language in Middle-earth during the Third Age, Sindarin remained the everyday language of Elves and Rangers of the North.
Sindarin became the language of the Noldor because of the command of King Thingol of Doriath.  Upon learning of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he declared that Quenya, the language of the Noldor, should be prohibited in his lands.  As the Noldor were dwelling in a Sindarin-speaking land, and because of the decree of Thingol though it did not directly affect them, they gradually switched entirely to Sindarin.  Their names were also changed to Sindarin, such as Finwë-Ñolofinwë to Fingolfin, and Turukáno to Turgon.
When the Elves of Beleriand first encountered the dwarves, they could not understand a word of the Khuzdul. Dwarves were swift to learn and indeed were more willing to learn Sindarin than to teach their own to those of alien race.
The written script alphabet of the Elven languages is typically Tengwar, although Cirth (itself originally intended specifically for Sindarin) can also be used.
== Grammar ==
Sindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected progenitor can still be seen.
=== Phonology ===
Sindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the same sounds and similar phonotactics.
{; Oromë#Etymology. is a compound of dôr+iath, where iath is just one syllable.) or ł in Navajo, or Quenya hl.  More specifically, it is a voiceless alveolar lateral, like s when spoken in a lateral lisp.  If nothing else works, try pronouncing l while whispering.-style Sindarin spellings, so that spellings like Tinúviel are preferred over *Tinúmhiel.  Suffice it to say that this spelling of mh is not used in Lord of the Rings-style Third Age Sindarin either.; Glamdring it is pronounced just like Sindarin e, so it is suitable to pronounce it like e.  Mostly found in First Age Sindarin words, and most famously in Nirnaeth Arnoediad.  Lord of the Rings-style Third Age Sindarin spellings do not use œ at all, only e, such as Ered Luin instead of *Œrœd Luin. hr.  If nothing else works, try pronouncing r while whispering..|-|ý||||&nbsp;||Sindarin ý is pronounced just noticeably longer in duration than Sindarin y, but otherwise is pronounced the same.|-|ŷ||||&nbsp;||Sindarin ŷ is pronounced for an even longer duration than Sindarin ý, usually in single-syllable words.  But it is permissible to pronounce it the same as ý.|}
=== Nouns ===
==== Pluralization ====
Sindarin plurals are characterised by i-affection, or umlaut (see also prestanneth "affection of vowels")., p. 427 Almost all Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and goose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns are:
{|-|i > i||brennil > brennil|-|î > î||dîs > dîs|-|o > y||annon > ennyn|-|ó > ý||bór > býr|-|ô > ŷ||thôn > thŷn|-|u > y||urug > yryg|-|û > ui||hû > hui|-|y > y||ylf > ylf|-|ý > ý||mýl > mýl|-|au > oe||naug > noeg|}
Note that ai can sometimes become î (or, less commonly, ý).
The reason for this is that the primitive plural ending -î (still present in Quenya as -i) affected the vowels in the word by making them higher and fronter.  After this sound change occurred, the suffix -î disappeared when all final vowels were lost.
==== Class Plural ====
Sindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class plural.  For example, -ath indicates a group of something, e.g. elenath from elen (an archaic form of êl), meaning "star" and -ath. It means "a group of stars" or "all the stars in the sky". Another ending, -rim, is used to indicate a race, e.g. nogothrim from nogoth — "dwarf" and -rim, meaning "the race of dwarves". The ending -hoth is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e.g. gaurhoth from gaur — "werewolf" and -hoth, meaning "werewolf-host".
=== Mutation ===
Sindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main different types of mutations: soft mutation (or lenition), nasal mutation and stop (occlusive) mutation. Additionaly, a mixed mutation is also observed after certain particles or prepositions. Finally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call an archaic spirantal mutation (also sometimes called liquid mutation by scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still productive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.
Initial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur in compound words (such as, for instance, in the names Araphor, Arassuil, and Caradhras).
The following table outlines how different consonants are affected by the different mutations:

Here the apostrophe indicates elision.
Words beginning in b-, d-, or g- which descend from older mb-, nd-, or ng- are affected differently by the mutations:

Take, for example, the deictic article i, which triggers soft mutation. When added to a word like tâl, it becomes i dâl. In Sindarins phonological history, t became d in the middle of a word. Because i tâl at the time was considered one word, the t became d, and thus i dâl. However, without the article the word is still tâl.
Mutation is triggered in various ways:
* Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by the singular article i, the prefixes athra-, ath-, go-, go-, ú-, and u-, as well as the prepositions ab, am, adel, be, dad, di, na, nu, and î, and after avo. It also affects the second element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object of a verb.
* Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article in, and the prepositions an, dan, and plural nin.
* Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article en, and the prepositions ben, erin, nan, nin, and uin.
* Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions ed, ned, and o(d).
* Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition or.
=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What has been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural and is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this article.
Sindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case distinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative forms.

=== Verbs ===
Sindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in Sindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no verb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of verbs: basic and derived. Basic verbs have stems which end in a consonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort derivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in -a.
==== Basic Verbs ====
Basic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very complex conjugation which arises from Sindarins phonological history.
Basic verbs form the infinitve by adding -i: giri from gir-. This ending causes an a or o in the stem to umlaut to e: blebi from blab-. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather uses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.
For all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is formed by the insertion of -i, and the proper enclitic pronomial ending: girin, girim, girir. As with the infinitive, -i causes an a or o in the stem to umlaut to e: pedin, pedim, pedir, from pad-. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending, does not require the insertion of -i. This leaves the bare stem, which, because of Sindarins phonological history, causes the vowel of the stem to become long: gîr, blâb, pâd.
The past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested. One common reconstructed system is to use -n: darn. However, the only time this -n actually remains is after a stem in -r. After a stem ending in -l, -n becomes -ll: toll. After -b, -d, -g, -v, or -dh, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of articulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then experiences what could be called a "backwards mutation": -b, -d, and -g become -p, -b, and -c, and -v and -dh become -m and -d. The matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added. Because -mp, -mb, -nt, -nd, and -nc did not survive medially, they become -mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-, and -ng. In addition, past tense stems in -m would have -mm- before any pronomial endings. Because this all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show step-by-step transformations:
* cab- > **cabn > **canb > **camb > camp, becoming camm- with any pronomial endings.
* ped- > **pedn > **pend > pent, becoming penn- with any pronomial endings.
* dag- > **dagn > **dang (n pronounced as in men) > **dang (n pronounced as in sing) > danc, becoming dang- with any pronomial endings.
* lav- > **lavn > **lanv > **lanm > **lamm > lam, becoming lamm- before any pronomial endings.
* redh- > **redhn > **rendh > **rend > rend, becoming renn- before any pronomial endings.
The future tense is formed by the addition of -tha. An -i is also inserted between the stem and -tha, which again causes a and o to umlaut to e. Endings for all persons except for the first person singular can be added without any further modification: giritham, blebithar. The first person singular ending -n causes the -a in -tha to become -o: girithon, blebithon, pedithon.
The imperative is formed with the addition of -o to the stem: giro!, pado!, blabo!.
==== Derived Verbs ====
Derived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a thematic vowel (usually a) which reduces the number of consonant combinations which occur.
The infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.g. lacho from lacha-.
The present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial endings are added without any change.
The past tense is formed with the ending -nt, which becomes -nne with any pronomial endings, e.g. erthant, erthanner.
The future tense is formed with -tha. With the addition of the first person singular -n, this becomes -tho.
The imperative is formed like the infinitive.
== Dialects ==
During the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:
*Doriathrin or the language of Doriath, a form of the language which preserved many archaic forms;
*Falathrin or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in Nargothrond;
*North Sindarin, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand proper.
With the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under Noldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique sound changes devised by the Noldor (who loved changing languages). The distinct dialects disappeared after the Noldor and Sindar were dispersed during the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of Balar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees, which mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age Sindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it was displaced as the Westron by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic which was heavily influenced by Sindarin.
Sindarin is actually a Quenya term. No Sindarin word for Sindarin is known, but usually the term Edhellen ("Elvish") is used in Neo-Sindarin.
==Etymology==
The word Sindarin itself is actually a Quenya word given by the Noldorin Exiles.  It is pronounced .
==Names==
Sindarin is the language referred to as "the Elven-tongue" in The Lord of the Rings. 
In a letter, J.R.R. Tolkien referred to Sindarin as Grey Elvish. In another manuscript he used the similar name Grey-elven., p. 127
==Inspiration==
Tolkien originally imagined that the language which would become Sindarin was spoken by the Noldor.  However, Tolkien later decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it is called "Noldorin" in the older material, such as the The Etymologies. When Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the originally unrelated language Ilkorin. Tolkien based the sound and some of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin displays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic (especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably influenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a scholar of both Old English and Old Norse.
