In Letter 347, written in 1972, there is a note which states: "The Silvan Elves of Thranduils realm did not speak Sindarin but a related language or dialect." This could be a mixture of Doriathrin, or Old Sindarin, mixing with the Silvan Elvish of the Nandor and Avari.See David Salos A Gateway to Sindarin p. 13     
==Portrayal in adaptations==
*2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Beorn says about these Elves that they are dangerous and less wise than their kindred. There seems to be a gap between the Sindar and the Silvan, as Thranduil disaproves Legolass affection for Tauriel.
