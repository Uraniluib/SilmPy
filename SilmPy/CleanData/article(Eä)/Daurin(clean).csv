Daurin, also called Tórin was a Noldo of the Elder Days. He was notable for attacking Morgoth and Ungoliant when they were attempting to destroy the Two Trees. After he had cut off one of Gwerlums legs, she threw a web around him and Melko killed him. He then took his blade which was laced with the black, poisonous blood of Gwerlum and proceeded to destroy the other tree, Silpion., p. 169
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The character that was to become Daurin was originally supposed to be Fëanor but this was abandoned. Then his name was changed to Daurlas, a kinsman of Fëanor, and finally to Daurin (Tórin): "Notes and Commentary", p. 172
