The Gate of Gold was the sixth of the Seven Gates of Gondolin. It was the last of the ancient gates of Turgon that were wrought before the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. The gate was similar in appearance to the Gate of Silver, however the wall was made of yellow marble, and the globes and parapet were of red gold. There were six globes, and in the midst upon a golden pyramid was set an image of Laurelin, with flowers wrought of topaz in long clusters upon chains of gold. The gate itself was decorated with many-rayed discs of gold, in likenesses of the sun, set amid devices of garnet and topaz and yellow diamonds. Beyond the gate were arrayed 300 archers with longbows, their mail was gilded and tall golden plumes rose from their helmets; and their great round shields were red as flame. This gate followed the Gate of Silver and was followed by the last gate, the Gate of Steel.
