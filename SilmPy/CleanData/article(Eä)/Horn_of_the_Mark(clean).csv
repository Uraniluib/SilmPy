The Horn of the Mark was a silver horn, made by the Dwarves. It was among their treasure that the Long-worms Scatha took from them. 
When Fram killed Scatha, his hoard became a matter of dispute between the Éothéod and the Dwarves. Nonetheless the Horn was taken by the Éothéod and apparently it became a heirloom of the House of Eorl even when they settled Rohan.
Centuries later, at the end of the War of the Ring, Lady Éowyn gave the Horn to Holdwine Meriadoc Brandybuck as a farewell gift for his services to Rohan.
On their return to the Shire, Merry used the Horn to sound the Horn-call of Buckland on 2 November  rousing the Shire-folk against the Ruffians who had taken control of the Shire.
In commemoration of those events and the liberation of the Shire, the Horn was sounded ceremonially every year at sundown on 2 November in Buckland, commencing celebrations with bonfires and feasts.
