Gamwich was a village in the Shire.Gamwich is one of the locations not included in the published map A Part of the Shire. Karen Fonstad placed it near the borders of the Westfarthing, but this is only speculation. See , Regional Maps, The Shire  
It was the home town of Hamfast of Gamwich (and the source of his chosen surname) and as such the origin of the Gamwich Family and the Gammidge Family (later Gamgee) families. The town was also known for its own rope-making.
==Etymology==
Gamwich is "translated" from Hobbitish Galabas meaning "game-village"
David Salo has suggested that the name represents a possible Old English form *Gamenwic "Game-village".
