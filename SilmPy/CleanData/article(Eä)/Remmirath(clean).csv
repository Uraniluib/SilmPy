Remmirath, or the Netted Stars, was a constellation in the skies over Arda.
==History==
Though not mentioned specifically, Remmiraths origin is likely the same to that of other constellations: it was created by Varda to signal the Elves to Valinor. In the Third Age, it could be clearly seen in the Eastern sky during the autumn.
==Etymology==
Remmirath is quite accurately translated with its Westron name the Netted Stars. The word is composed of three elements: rem, "mesh", mir, "jewel", and the collective plural suffix -ath. It has been translated as "group of gems in a net" and "group of jewels caught in a net". Two other names were used for Pleiades at early stages of the legendarium: Gnomish Sithaloth or Sithaloctha, which means "fly-cluster",, p. 255 and Qenya Itselokte of similar meaning., p. 43 
==Inspiration==
Remmirath is identified as the constellation wikipedia:Pleiades., pp. 5-31, p. 24
