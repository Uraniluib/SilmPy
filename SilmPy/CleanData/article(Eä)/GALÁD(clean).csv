GALÁD is an Elvish Sundocarmë possibly derived from GALA. It has to do with growth and plants.
*Quenya: alda, Oromë#Etymology, Aldalemnar
*Telerin: galla
*Sindarin: galadh, Galadhor, Galdor of the Tree, Galadloriel/Galagloriel, Galathilvion
*Doriathrin: gald, galbreth
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Tolkien wrote both GALAD and added GALÁD in The Etymologies, without striking out the first one.
