Bagshot Row was the row of Hobbit-holes that were delved into Hobbiton Hill beneath Bag End. The Gamgee Family lived at Number 3, Bagshot Row. Their neighbour was Daddy Twofoot.It is not mentioned whether he lived at Number 2 or Number 4. The dwellings had gardens and earthwalls made of the earth removed during the excavation of Bag End.
During the War of the Ring and the occupation of the Shire, Saruman had it torn up, and it had become a yawning sand and gravel pit.  After the Battle of Bywater the destruction was replaced by a new row called, simply, New Row (in the town of Bywater it became a joke to refer to it as Sharkeys End).
==Etymology==
It was so named because the earth removed in excavating Bag End was shot over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground., p. 765
