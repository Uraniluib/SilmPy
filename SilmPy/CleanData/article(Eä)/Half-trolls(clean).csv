Half-trolls was a term used to describe the men of Far Harad that came to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. They were black skinned with white eyes and red tongues. Later in the Battle, the knights of Dol Amroth drove off the "troll-men and Variags and orcs".
==Inspiration==
According to Christopher Tolkien, a character in the Wikipedia:Legends about Theodoric the Great#The Thidrekssaga (a 13th century work which influenced The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún), who is an off-spring of a woman and an Wikipedia:incubus, appears "troll-like" and is "all over dark, with black hair and black beard"., "Appendix A: Origins of the Legend", p. 357
