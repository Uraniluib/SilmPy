Ulmo (Quenya, pronounced ) was a Valar, also known as King of the Sea, Lord of Waters, and Dweller of the Deep. One of the mightiest of the Ainur, he was second in majesty of the Aratar, after Manwë and Varda.
At several points Ulmo was notable for setting himself apart from his brethren, and also for being the friendliest to the Children of Eru.
==Attributes==
Ulmo is the Lord of Waters and King of the Sea. He is the Ainu most deeply instructed in music, and it is said that in water the Eldar hear the echo of the Music of the Ainur. He lives in the deeps under Ambar who alone has seen where he devises his music and whence he governs all waters, bays and rivers.
From the beginning Manwë has been his closest friend and ally and they come together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air, or mists and dew. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.
Ulmo was unique among the Valar in several ways; he was alone, taking no spouse among the Valier; he didnt dwell in Valinor but in Ekkaia from the beginning, preferring the deeps of the seas around and below Ambar, and the rivers. He seldom appeared to the councils of his brethren, save in matters of great importance. 
Likewise, he seldomly wore a fana but he came to the shores unseen or entered firths of the sea and rivers and it was said his spirit was in the very veins of the world. He spoke through the sound of water, and made music with his horns the Ulumúri. But whenever he appeared, he was dreadful and terrible "as a mounting wave that strides to the land"; he wore a dark foam-crested helm and a shimmering silver-green mail, and his voice was deep like the ocean.  
Ulmo cared about Arda and the Children of Eru, and through the veins of the world he kept in touch with them and saw every grief and need, and thus knew more of the goings on with them than even Manwë. Even while the Valar were secluded in Valinor or when the Children were under the wrath of his brethren, Ulmo, alone of the Valar, was the one who never forsook them.
==History==
Ulmo was very close in friendship to Manwë before Ea was made, and although Manwë was the most dear to Ilúvatar, of all the Ainur Ulmo was most deeply instructed in music. Ulmo with Manwë and Aulë were the architects of Arda.
He had always distrusted Morgoth. The Dark Lord feared him almost as much as he feared Varda, since the sea cannot be tamed.
When the Valar retreated to Valinor, Ulmo remained to the Outer Sea, and while his brethren neglected the Outer Lands during the Sleep of Yavanna, Ulmo kept the earth alive under the darkness. 
He seldomly came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, but Ulmo defended the Eldar in the council from the potential wrath of Mandos. 
He opposed Oromës plan to bring the Elves to Aman. But he eventually helped them get to Aman, because he knew that was what they wanted, and he accepted that. He tore a great piece of land off the shores of Beleriand and used it to transport the Eldar to the blessed coasts of Aman. He anchored the island (it was renamed Tol Eressëa) in the Bay of Eldamar, which he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri.
When the time came for Melkor to be given a second chance, Ulmo was disappointed when Manwë pardoned Melkor after serving his time in bondage. Ulmo was ever distrustful of Melkor, an opinion shared by Tulkas and Varda.
Ulmos vassal Ossë, and Ossës spouse Uinen were, to the elves, the best known of the Maiar.  Through them Ulmo would learn much of the elves.
During the First Age Ulmo protected Sirion and Gelion and directed more than any other Vala the Children of Ilúvatar. He urged Turgon to build Gondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond. 
He chose Tuor as his instrument before his birth, by helping Huor and Húrin reach Gondolin and telling Turgon to accept him, as aid would come from the House of Hador. Years later, he guided Tuor directing him to Gondolin as a messenger for Turgon. Despite his warnings, Turgon chose not to abandon Gondolin. Tuor eventually married Turgons daughter Idril and fathered Eärendil the Half-elven; Ulmo saved Elwing from the sack of the Havens of Sirion, and thus she took the Silmarils to her husband Eärendil which allowed them to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for their mercy.
==Etymology==
The name Ulmo is said to derive from the Valarin Ullubōz.
Alternatively, Ulmo is a Quenya title, which means "He who pours" (cf. ulya- "to pour" and agentive ending -mo "-er").
In the earlier writings his Noldorin name was Ylmir, among them Tuors The Horns of Ylmir. (Another Noldorin translation of his name is given as Nûron.), p. 378 (entry for NŪ-), p. 7 The Sindarin form is Ulu (), though he is also called Guiar () and Gulma ().
In Eriols Old English translations, Ulmo is referred to by various names: Garsecges  frea "Ocean ruler", ealwaeter-frea "All-waters ruler" or agendfrea ealra waetera "owning lord of all waters".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
His palace, on the bottom of the Outer Sea, was called Ulmonan., p. 270
