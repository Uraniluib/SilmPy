While Eärendil is a Quenya name inside the legendarium, Tolkien created the name based on Old English literature. Tolkien himself stated that the name was derived from the Old English éarendel. He says that he was struck by the "great beauty" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as "entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not delectable language."
There is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled The Voyage of Eärendel the Evening Star., pp. 267–9 Tolkien was also aware of the names Germanic cognates (Old Norse Aurvandill, Lombardic Auriwandalo), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in The Notion Club Papers. The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in Crist christianized to refer to John the Baptist).
Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in Wikipedia:Christ I:
éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended
"Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / sent over Middle-earth to men."
which can be taken as the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkiens work, but also for the term Middle-earth (translating Middangeard) for the inhabitable lands.
The first line is paralleled by Frodo Bagginss exclamation in Shelobs Lair, "Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!" which is in Quenya and translates as "Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!". Frodos exclamation was in reference to the "Phial of Galadriel" he carried, which contained the light of Eärendils star, the Silmaril.
