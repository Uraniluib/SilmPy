Dimbar was an empty land in Beleriand.
==Geography==
Dimbar formed a wedge between the Sirion and the Brethil in the west and the Mindeb and Neldoreth in the east (and Nan Dungortheb in the northeast). The main road, which crossed the Sirion at the Ford of Brithiach to Himring, cut Dimbar in half; to the north of the road the land climbed to the vales of the Crissaegrim.
No settlements or inhabitants were mentioned in Dimbar.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, entry "Dimbar"
==History==
During a battle with orcs, Huor and Húrin, at a very young age, became lost and desperate in a mist in Dimbar. They were found by Thorondor, and would be the first mortals to see Gondolin.
After then Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Orcs from Taur-nu-Fuin built a road through Anach and the land was overrun by Orcs. Túrin and Beleg would lead raids against them.
After Morgoth had freed Húrin he came to the land of Dimbar. There he stood before the silent cliffs of the Echoriath and cried out for Turgon to hear him. But Húrin had been followed and was heard, and his words told Morgoth where Turgon dwelt.
==Etymology==
Dimbar is Sindarin from dim "sad" and -mbar "dwellingplace, home".
