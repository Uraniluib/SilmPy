The Muster of Edoras were the Rohirrim that could be mustered to war from Edoras and the Kings Lands, including those from Harrowdale in the White Mountains. By tradition, the Muster of Edoras was under the command of the First Marshal of the Riddermark. At the time of the War of the Ring, this tradition had lapsed, partly through the schemes of Saruman and Gr√≠ma. Though there was no First Marshal, the Muster did have a leader in Elfhelm, though he did not at that time carry the title of Marshal.
