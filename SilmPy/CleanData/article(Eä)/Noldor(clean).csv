==Characteristics==
The Noldor were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar, a smaller group, and the Teleri, a much larger one. The Noldor typically had grey eyes, fair skin, and dark hair, save for the members of the golden-haired House of Finarfin.
However, the Noldor were the proudest of the Elves; in the words of the Sindar, they came to Middle-earth because "they needed room to quarrel in". It was this pride that Melkor used to turn the Houses of House of Fëanor and House of Fingolfin against each other. The pride of the Noldor also led to their Fall of the Noldor and Exile of the Noldor (and their continued quarrels in Middle-earth, as noted by the Sindar).
Of the three clans of the Eldar they are also the people who most favors sword and shield as their weapons., p. 215 footnote to §29, p. 228 footnote to §49
==Etymology and Names==
The singular form of the Quenya noun is Noldo and the adjective is Noldorin.
noldo is derived from the Elvish Sundocarme NGOL., p. 383
The Noldor were called Golodhrim (pron. ) or Gódhellim () by Sindarin-speakers and Goldoi by Falmari of Tol Eressëa; they are also known as Deep Elves ("deep" as in "wise, learned").  Additionally, the Sindarin singular Golodh () could be pluralized Golodhrim, Gelydh (, later ) or more archaicly Gœlydh ().
The Noldor were known as the "Deep-elves". Other names used for the Noldor included the Wise, the Golden, the Valiant, the Sword-elves, the Elves of the Earth, the Foes of Melkor, the Skilled of Hand, the Jewel-wrights, the Companions of Men, and the Followers of Finwë., p. 164 It is also told that the Noldor were often called the Lispers by other native speakers of Quenya (such as the Vanyar), since they retained the medial "th" in their speech., p. 34
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the early versions of Tolkiens Middle-earth legendarium (see: The History of Middle-earth), the Noldor were most often called Noldoli or Gnomes. They were still called Gnomes in early editions of The Hobbit. They were also the ones who spoke the language that later became Sindarin (then called Gnomish or Noldorin).
The spelling Ñoldor rather than Noldor was used by Tolkien in his later writings (the character ñ signifying the velar nasal, the sound found in the English word "sing"), but even in earlier versions the name Ñoldo came from a Primitive Quendian stem *ñgolod&#333;, which led to Ñoldo in Quenya and Golodh in Sindarin.
The family tree given above is correct in the placement of Orodreth and Gil-galad: Orodreth was Angrods son, and Gil-galad was Orodreths son, thus the grandson of Angrod and great-grandson of Finarfin, and brother to Finduilas. These are wrongly placed in the published Silmarillion. (See Orodreth and Gil-galad articles for details). Argon, the third son of Fingolfin, does not appear in the published Silmarillion at all.
