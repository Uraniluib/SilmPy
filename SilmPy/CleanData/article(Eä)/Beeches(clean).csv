Beeches (Sindarin neldor) were broad and tall trees that grew throughout Middle-earth, and especially in its northern regions. The most famous beech-forest of all was Forest of Neldoreth in Doriath., Neldoreth Hírilorn, the three-trunked tree in which Lúthien was imprisoned, was perhaps the greatest beech that had ever grown. In the attack on Isengard by the Ents, the Ent which caught fire and burned to death was called Beechbone.
