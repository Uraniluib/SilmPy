harma is a noun meaning "treasure" in Quenya., Note, The names of the letters
 Image:Harma.gifHarma (the h was pronounced as ch) was also the name in Quenya of the eleventh letter of the Tengwar alphabet.  It is the third letter of the third grade or Tyellë, which contains "voiceless spirants" and it is the third letter in the third series of consonants.
*For written Quenya, the third series is used for the k-series, the Calmatéma.  Originally Harma represented spirant CH in all positions.  Over time the initial sound softened into breath H at the beginning of words (a sound for which Quenya originally used a letter called Halla); the letter Harma was then used only in medial positions, where the original CH sound was retained, and to reflect this, it was renamed Aha., Note, The names of the letters, footnote 1  
*In Sindarin this letter represents CH.
*In Westron, the third series is used for a variety of consonantal sounds and this letter represents SH.  The Westron name for this letter is Shé.See Westron Tengwar
