Erelas was one of the seven warning beacons of Gondor, the fourth that would be lit when Minas Tirith called for aid from Rohan. It was a bald green hill, with no trees or plants. Its attendants would set fire to their beacon when they saw a flame on Nardol, far to the east, and their own beacon-fire would be answered by that on the peak of Min-Rimmon to the west. All these beacon hills lay among the White Mountains as they came down into the plains of An√≥rien, the fief of Gondor that lay on Rohans borders.
On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
==Etymology==
Despite being Sindarin in style, Erelas was not a Sindarin name. The true meaning of the name is lost in history., p. 19
