Umbar was a great haven to the far south of Gondor in Middle-earth.
==Geography==
Umbar was located south of the outflow of Anduin at the Bay of Belfalas in a convenient, useful natural haven. The great cape and land-locked firth formed the port. The Pre-Númenóreans called it "Umbar" and the Númenóreans who discovered it, adopted its name.
Umbar was the nearest to Gondor of the southern realms. It may ultimately have stretched all along Harnen as far as the Ephel Dúath up to the edge of Khand.
==History==
===Foundation and Númenórean Rule===
Like the earlier Lond Daer Ened in Enedwaith, and the later Pelargir on the Anduin, Umbar was one of the trading ports at the southern coast of Middle-earth, which became a base from which Númenórean influence spread over Middle-earth. In  it was made into a great fortress as a reaction to the growing threat of Sauron and became the strongest and most important. 
During the dissension arising when the Shadow fell on Númenor, Umbar was the northernmost settlement of the Kings Men; Sauron, after trying to break the waxing Númenórean grip by instigation, attempted to attack the Númenórean havens and forts, invaded their coastlands, but Umbar resisted.
It was at Umbar that Ar-Pharazôn the Golden landed in  to challenge Sauron and journeyed 7 days with banner and trumpet. Umbar remained a symbol of Númenórean pride ever after.
While Sauron was in Númenor and the Shadow and dissidence became greater, Umbar was one of the fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts, inhabited by the Kings Men and servants in Middle-earth to his will; these evil lords concentrated mostly to the south, far from the dominion of Gil-galad. Umbar must have been an important point of deportation of slaves and taxes to Númenor.
After the Downfall of Númenor, Umbar remained in the hands of the Númenóreans, in essence a realm-in-exile alongside Arnor and Gondor. But unlike these others, Umbar had been used by the Black Númenóreans, who were not friendly to the Elves or to their fellow Faithful Númenórean survivors.
 
Two Black Númenórean lords, Herumor and Fuinur, were probably from Umbar, as at the end of Second Age they became very powerful amongst the Haradrim, a neighbouring people. No doubt, Númenóreans of Umbar were enlisted with Sauron in . Their fate is unknown, but they likely shared Saurons defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.
The rulers of Umbar retained much influence over the Haradwaith well into Third Age. Other southern settlements were absorbed by the native cultures of Harad.
Gondors power, however, eclipsed that of Umbar as the Third Age progressed, and at one point, perhaps around the time of Tarannon Falastur, Umbar acknowledged the sway of Gondor. Tarannon had a diplomatic marriage to Berúthiel, a Black Númenórean, perhaps from Umbar. During his reign, Tarannon extended the sway of Gondor along the southern shore-lands. 
in  Gondors King Eärnil I captured Umbar in a Surprise Attack on Umbar after a siege by sea and land, although this was "at great cost." It became a great harbour and fortress of the power of Gondor. Ironically, it was outside Umbar where Eärnil with his ships and men perished in a great storm ().
===Umbar as part of Gondor===
For the following 500 years, Umbar was an important Gondorian city: not only as a major sea-port, but as the site of the submission of Sauron to Ar-Pharazôn, and so served as a proud reminder of the might of the Dúnedain of old.
Many Black Númenóreans had fled Umbar from the assault of  to their subjects in Near Harad and prevented Gondor to take lands south of Harnen; Third Age 1015, in a vain attempt to recapture it, they came up with great power against the stronghold. This great power availed the Men Of Harad little, however, for despite investing and besieging the fortress of Umbar for 35 years, they failed to take it, as its supply was easily maintained "because of the sea-power of Gondor." In , the late King Earnils son Ciryandil defeated the Haradrim force by sending troops by land, crossing Harnen, and by sea. All land south of Belfalas up to Harnen and the borders of Near Harad and coast-lands up to Umbar belonged to Gondor. 
It was during this occupation when the Gondorians built a monument to Ar-Pharazôn on the highest hill above the Haven: a great white pillar crowned with a globe of crystal which shone as a star with the rays of the Sun or Moon.
Umbar and the southern provinces experienced a rebellion during the Kin-strife of Gondor (-); together with the people of Pelargir, Umbar supported the usurper Castamir. When the war had ended, Castamirs sons and their supporters left Pelargir and established themselves at Umbar; from that point on, Umbar remained an enemy of the King.
===Corsairs of Umbar===

Since , the fleets of the secessionists established under the descendants of Castamir became known as the "Corsairs of Umbar", an independent realm; thus Gondor lost both its southern province and its naval power and came in constant war against the line of Castamir. Within two following centuries, Umbar attacked Gondorian ships and raided its coast at every opportunity, threatening the coastlands and all traffic on the sea and contested the possession of Harondor.
Umbar would welcome exiles from Gondor who were suspected for treason or conspiring against the King. Umbar would also take to its side and absorb tributaries to Gondor in Harad. In , King Aldamir fought with the rebelling kings of Harad.. The latter were defeated by his son Hyarmendacil II Third Age 1551.
In , Castamirs great-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando raided Pelargir, from Umbar, killing King Minardil; his heir Telemnar prepared a fleet against Umbar but could not retaliate as the kingdom was ravaged by the Great Plague of . 
Vengeance, if not swift, was certainly devastating; by Third Age 1810 the Corsairs raided as far as Anfalas, and Minardils great-grand nephew Telumehtar punished them. In an attack he destroyed the fortress and haven of the Corsairs and drove them out, killing Castamirs last descendants. After this victory he renamed himself Umbardacil but left Umbar unsettled and ruined, apparently with a protective garrison. 
In the meantime, the Haradrim were "engaged in wars and feuds of their own" and threatened by the Wainriders empire from Rhûn. But Umbar still fell when enemies invaded Gondor from the east and south in , preventing Gondor to use it to support its forces from the sea; Eärnil IIs Southern Army vanquished the invaders.
Umbar had been reclaimed by the Haradrim, rebuilt and occupied and for the rest of the Third Age. It became a home for a new generation of Corsairs of Umbar, who must have been closely related to the Haradrim, if not even merely Southrons themselves. These new Corsairs were cruel slavers who often raided the coasts of Belfalas and Anfalas in Gondor: in , for example, Amrothos, the 15th Prince of Dol Amroth fell defending Dor-en-Ernil against them.
In , Umbar joined a massive co-ordinated attack with the Men of the Harad and even of Dunland against Gondor and the new realm of Rohan. In , Umbar supported the Haradrim who claimed Harondor, although this had long "been a debatable land between the Corsairs and the Kings", and when Sauron declared himself openly in , Umbar declared its allegiance to him, and the great monument commemorating Ar-Pharazôns triumph at Umbar was thrown down. 
Umbars fleet was largely destroyed 29 years later, when Thorongil (Aragorn Elessar, as it later turned out) in the service of the Steward of Gondor Ecthelion II led a taskforce south and burned them, killing the Captain of the Haven in the process.
===War of the Ring===
During the War of the Ring, Umbar had not fully recovered from this, but could still send 50 "great ships" and a number of smaller vessels "beyond count" to raid the coastlands of Gondor, and draw off major forces from the defence of Minas Tirith. They were once again defeated by Aragorn, and the Oathbreakers. With the Fall of Barad-dûr, Umbar, weakened and defeated, finally lost its sovereignty and submitted to the crown of King Elessar.
==Culture==
===Politics and rule===
While the Faithful boasted the ethnic purity of the line of their rulers (to the amount of resulting even in a Kin-strife), Umbar allowed their race to swiftly dwindle and merge with the Pre-Númenóreans.
No "King of Umbar" is mentioned to rise, though the Black Númenóreans, who, regarding the Heirs of Elendil as usurpers, certainly considered themselves the representatives of the last legal King of Númenor. One can suppose as a possible explanation that they considered themselves something akin to the temporary Ruling Stewards of Gondor, ruling in the true Kings absence, until Ar-Pharazôn would return from the West to restore his evil kingdom.http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Umbar.html It is notable that all four known rulers of Umbar come in pairs, suggesting that perhaps Umbar was traditionally ruled by a duumvirate.
===Language===
Nothing is known about the language of Umbar, but no doubt, it must have been Adûnaic, probably holding back the Elvish elements which created Westron of the Third Age, resulting perhaps in a Haradric variety of the language.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Umbar appeared on the bottom edge of the maps found in earlier editions of The Lord of the Rings, but it is absent from modern editions, which regrettably map a slightly smaller area of Middle-earth.
==Etymology==
Umbar is a Mannish name of unknown meaning and origin, and despite the coincidental similarity, it is not related to Quenya Umbar (word).
