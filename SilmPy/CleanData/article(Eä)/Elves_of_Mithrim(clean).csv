The Elves of Mithrim were the Sindar inhabitants of the land of Mithrim.
The Elves of Mithrim crossed into Hithlum from Beleriand at some time before the rising of the Sun, settling in the regions around Lake Mithrim. They were the first Elves of Middle-earth encountered by the Noldor upon their return from Aman. Fingolfin took up lordship in Hithlum, with most of his own people dwelling around the shores of Lake Mithrim, and there was presumably a degree of intermingling between the two peoples. It is not stated to what extent the Grey-elves of Mithrim participated in the Wars of Beleriand under Fingolfin and Fingon. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad they sheltered RÃ­an; when she departed Hithlum, one of the Elves, Annael, fostered her son Tuor.

The Elves of Mithrim spoke a marked dialect of Sindarin.
==Etymology==
Mithrim has two alternate etymologies. In the earlier version, Mithrim was Noldorin in origin, including the roots mith- "fog, misty, grey" and -rhim(b) "cold" or "cold lake".
A later version is that Mithrim "grey folk" was applied by the Sindar of Beleriand to their kindred who had gone north into Hithlum. The climate north of Ered Wethrin was cool, misty, and grey, but the Elves also wove a grey cloth that aided in their concealment. It is also suggested that the Noldor first used the term Sindar (or Sindeldi) to refer to the Elves of Mithrim, later applying it to all the Sindarin-speaking Elves of Beleriand.
