Ropers were those whose occupation was to create rope. While all races undoubtedly had rope makers, in Lothl√≥rien the Elves used hithlain to make a superior rope that was grey and silky to the touch. In the Shire, some ancestors of Samwise Gamgee took up the occupation of rope making and even used the word "Roper" as a surname:
 
# Hob Gammidge acquired the epithet of "the Roper".
# Hobson was known by the nickname of "Roper Gamgee".
# Andwise Roper, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father, established "Roper" as his last name.
# Anson Roper continued the use of his fathers last name.
