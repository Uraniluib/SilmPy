Gorthol, "The Dread Helm", was one of Túrins many aliases, taken by him as the captain of Dor-Cúarthol, p. 146 in reference to the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin., p. 79
==History==
The name was used by Túrin during the time he dwelt with Beleg in the caverns of Amon Rûdh. It comes from the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin of Dor-lómin that he wore when he hunted Orcs with Beleg, and the fame of his helm, and the bow of Beleg, gave that region for a time the name Dor-Cúarthol, the Land of Bow and Helm. 
Because of its fame, the mighty Helm of Hador was to be Túrins undoing. Through it, despite his alias, Morgoth was able to learn where Túrin could be found. Through the treachery of Mîm, Túrin was captured by Orcs, and carried off toward Angband.
