 

The term Gnomes or Noldoli was briefly used in J.R.R. Tolkiens early work The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation) to describe the race of Elves that would become the Noldor. In those works he borrowed several folkloric names to describe his original creations, like Fae, Elves, Dwarves, Ogres and Orcs#Orcs and Goblins.
The names of the Noldoli are in the Goldogrin (or Gnomish) language.
==Etymology==
In a letter dating from 1973, Tolkien stated that the word gnome derives from  Wikipedia:Paracelsus,J.R.R. Tolkien, "Letter to Elena Jeronimides" (letter) who is known to have used Modern Latin gnomus in a 16th century treatise.
The word likely comes from genomos "earth-dweller". It has a similarity with Greek γνώσις gnosis "knowledge" which is why Tolkien used it for the wise clan of his Elves (Quenya Noldor "the Wise").
Cf. also the Mannish word nóm meaning "wisdom".
==Inspiration==
A Wikipedia:Gnome is a dwarf-like creature of European folklore, often associated with Dwarves and Orcs. Traditional Gnomes however were unlike his depiction of his High Elves, they were imagined as deformed, underground and by the 19th century were depicted dwarf-like. 
For that reason Tolkien dropped the term since that would confuse the readers. However, other folkloric names like "Elves", "Dwarves" and "Goblins" would persist in Tolkiens writing ever since, although he would be unsure about them (he did replace "Goblin" with "Orcs" after the publication of The Hobbit").
In the first Portuguese translation of The Hobbit, the title of the book is translated as Wiktionary:gnomo#Portuguese, the Portuguese word for gnome. See: O Gnomo.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
At one time, "Gnomes" also referred to the Valar.
