==Etymology==
The word Wiktionary:quarry#Etymology 1 is derived from Latin quarreria through French.
David Salo noted that the usage of a Latin-French word as a place-name is peculiar, in contrast to all other placenames which have Old English and/or Celtic etymologies; he suggests that the name perhaps represents a late Westron word, and not an original Hobbitish place-name.
