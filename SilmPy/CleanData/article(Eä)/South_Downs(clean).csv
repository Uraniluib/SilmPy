The South Downs was a range of hills that ran through the central regions of Eriador. They were a dreary, empty land with scarce vegetation.
Walking along the East-West Road from Bree to the Weather Hills, one could see the Downs to the south. The Greenway, running through the Andrath, separated the South Downs from the Barrow-downs., "General Map of Middle-earth" map
