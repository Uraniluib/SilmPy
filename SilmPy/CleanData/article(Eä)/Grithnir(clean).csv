Grithnir was a servant of the House of Hador. In the prime of his life, in the time of Hador, Grithnir was said to have travelled widely in Beleriand, and come to know its ways well. For this reason, in his old age, he was selected by Morwen as one on the two guides to travel to Doriath with her son Túrin. They were successful, and Túrin was taken into King Thingols court, but unlike his companion Gethron, Grithnir never saw his northern homelands again. He became sick while a guest in Menegroth, and died before he could make the journey home.
