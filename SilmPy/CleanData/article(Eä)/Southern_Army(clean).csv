The Southern Army was the smaller of the two armies formed by King Ondoher of Gondor, to protect his kingdom against the double threat of the Wainriders to the northeast, and the Haradrim to the south. The command of the Southern Army was given to Eärnil II, a descendant of the royal line of Gondor.
