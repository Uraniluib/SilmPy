The Years of the Sun was the time after the first rising of the Sun in the First Age until the present.
The unit of time of the Years of the Sun was the coranar, also referred to as a loa.
The Valar intended a Year of the Sun to be exactly 350 full days, being a 1/10 fraction of a Years of the Trees. However the Sun was slower than expected and in one Year of the Sun, it turns 365.25 times instead of 350, or approximately 1/9.58 of a Year of the Trees.
