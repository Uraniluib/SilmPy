The Keeper of the DungeonsDespite appearing in the ending credits of The Battle of the Five Armies, he was never given an actual name by the film makers, making him and Azogs underling the only orcs with speaking roles without a name is a Gundabad orc played by Conan Stevens in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. Originally intended to be an early design of Azog, his design was later reused for Bolg, and appeared as such in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and was then scrapped and re-used for this Orc.

The Keeper of the Dungeons first spots Gandalf hanging in a cage in Dol Guldur. He removes the cage, and then opens it to remove Gandalf. He then starts interrogating Gandalf about the Three Rings, when suddenly, he spots Narya on the Wizardss hand. He attempts to chop it off, but is interrupted by Galadriel, who blasts the orc in pieces, killing him.This all happens in the extended edition. In the theatrical version, he still attempts to kill Gandalf, but this time for intruding into Dol Guldur.
