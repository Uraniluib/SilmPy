The Water or the Shire-water, p.66 was the main river of the Shire, a tributary of the Baranduin.
==Geography==
The Water arose to the north-west of Needlehole, and a little to its south formed Rushock Bog.  Before flowing through Hobbiton the Water was quite narrow and easily crossed by a plank bridge, and was shadowed by alder-trees.  From there, it flowed through Hobbiton and into the Bywater Pool at Bywater, where it was joined by a stream from the north. From then on, it flowed eastward alongside the East Road, which ran through the valley of the Water, and it joined the Brandywine just north of the Brandywine Bridge.
==Inspiration==
The naming of the Water may be a parody of some sorts of Celtic hydronyms that mean simply "river" or "water".Mark T. Hooker, A Tolkienian Mathomium, pp. 65-68.
