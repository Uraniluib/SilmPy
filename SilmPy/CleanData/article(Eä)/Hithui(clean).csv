Hithui was the Sindarin name for the eleventh month of the year, equivalent to Quenya Hísimë and comparable to the Shire-hobbits Blotmath and modern November. Its name comes from the Elvish word for mist, and it marked the descent of winter on Middle-earth. After the beginning of Hithui, no long journeys were attempted in the Northlands until the arrival of the following spring.
