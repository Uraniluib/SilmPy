 
Morwë was one of the leaders of the Avari, along with Nurwë, those of the Elves who refused the summons of Oromë. Instead of opting to travel to Aman, they remained at Cuiviénen with half of the Tatyar (the second clan who later became known as the Noldor) and a third of the Nelyar (the third clan, later known as the Teleri).
