The West-gate of Bree was the portal into Bree on the west side of the settlement.
==Description==
The West-gate was one of the two openings of the hedge that surrounded Bree, at the points where the East Road entered and exited the village. Being the westernmost opening to Bree, it looked towards the Shire. It was guarded by one Harry Goatleaf during the War of the Ring, though he later joined with Bill Ferny and the followers of Saruman. Since it is mentioned that the gate clanged when shut it apparently was made of metal.
==History==
Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, and Samwise Gamgee arrived at the West-gate on 29 September  well after dark.  Harry Goatleaf was sitting in a lodge beyond the gate but when the hobbits arrived he jumped up, fetched a lantern, and looked over the gate.  He questioned the travelers before allowing them entry.  After the hobbits left a dark figure climbed over the gate without Harry being aware of his entry.
Later Aragorn told the hobbits that Nazg√ªl had visited Harry Goatleaf at the West-gate on Monday (27 September).
After the War of the Ring the four hobbits returned to Bree on their journey home.  They passed through the West-gate heading for the Shire on 30 October .
