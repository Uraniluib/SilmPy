The Men of the Vales of Anduin are peoples who lived to the north from Gondor and acknowledged its authority when the South-Kingdom reached the summit of its power in the days of king Hyarmendacil in the twelfth century T.A..
It seems that the Men of the Vales of Anduin were ancestors of the Éothéod, who moved to the regions near the sources of Anduin from the vales of Anduin between the Carrock and the Gladden during the reign of the king Eärnil II in the 21th century T.A.. At least they most probably descended from the Edain of the First Age like most of the Men of the northern parts of the Westlands..
Their language had some influence on the language of the Hobbits who lived in the Vales of Anduin in that time.; . The influence is detectable at least in the Hobbit personal names and in the names of the months of the Shire Calendar.
