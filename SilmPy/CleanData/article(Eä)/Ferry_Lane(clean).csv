The Ferry Lane was a short road that led from the Causeway, the high-banked roadway west of the Baranduin, down to the ferry landing opposite Buck Hill in Buckland.  The lane was south of the town of Stock and five or more miles north of Farmer Maggot lane.  The entrance to the lane was marked by two tall white posts.  The hundred yards of Ferry Lane were edged with large white-washed stones and ended at a broad wooden landing-stage for the ferry to Buckland.
It was at the entrance to Ferry Lane that Meriadoc Brandybuck caught up with Frodo Baggins and the other hobbits after their ride from Farmer Maggots home.  After crossing the river the hobbits saw a Nazg√ªl that had followed them down Ferry Lane to the landing.
