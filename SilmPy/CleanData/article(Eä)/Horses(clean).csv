Horses were beasts of burden and transport used by Elves and Men through the ages. Famous among horses were Nahar, the steed of Oromë, Rochallor, the warhorse of Fingolfin, and Felaróf, the steed of Eorl the Young. The breeding and riding of horses were arts developed to their greatest height, among Men, by the Rohirrim in the Third Age.
==History==
Horses existed as native creatures in Middle-earth; however, in The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings there is evidence that some of the breeds in Middle-earth, particularly in Beleriand and Rohan, were enhanced by sires brought from Aman. Although horses may have roamed freely when Men awoke with the rising of the Sun, it is unclear if the Elves who stayed in Middle-earth - the Sindar, Nandor, and Avari - had horses while "Middle-earth lay for the most part in the Sleep of Yavanna."
In the early days of the First Age, Oromë was heard sounding his horn, Valároma, and riding through Beleriand and over the mountains hunting the fell beasts of Morgoth. He had been riding and hunting there with his folk since before the Firstborn awoke and, of all the Valar, came the most reluctantly to Valinor. But, the Sindar were awed by his splendour and feared him and the "great noise and onrush of Nahar." This does not mean that the early Elves feared horses, as they would have no reason to fear any natural and uncorrupted beast, or that they did not keep horses themselves.
In Valinor, the Elves did ride. Fëanors son, Celegorm, "in Valinor was a friend of Oromë, and often followed the Valas horn." Aredhel, while still in Eldamar, was also mentioned as one who loved to ride and hunt in the forests. The Noldor brought some of their horses, which flourished in Ard-galen, from Valinor with them on the ships that sailed to Losgar:

The Rohirrim believed their noble horse line, the Mearas, must have had a sire that was brought by the hunter Béma (Oromë) from the West. 
The horses of Elves were ridden bitless, with only decorative headstalls and saddles, or wholly without tack, and the Mearas, like elf horses, also seemed to prefer being ridden thus by the riders they allowed.
