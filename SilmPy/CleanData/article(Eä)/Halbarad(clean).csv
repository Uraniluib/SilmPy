Halbarad was a Rangers of the North of Eriador. 
==Life==
Halbarad spent his early life watching the borders of the Shire. 
During the War of the Ring, Halbarad was sent to the aid of his Chieftains of the Dúnedain Aragorn. From Eriador, he led a thirty-man strong group of Rangers, calling themselves the Grey Company. With them rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. In the night between the 5 March and the 6 March, the Company met Aragorn at Dol Baran. Halbarad gave his kinsman a standard, which was a gift from Arwen, and a message, summoning him to take the Paths of the Dead.
The Grey Company, now with Gimli and Legolas part of Aragorns comitatus, passed through the Paths of the Dead, to the Stone of Erech, over Tarlangs Neck, and on to Pelargir. He captained a Corsair ship and they sailed toward Harlond in Gondor.
On 15 March they arrived on the Pelennor Fields and fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Halbarad unfurled the standard, and it showed the White Tree of Gondor of Gondor and the signs of Elendil. He was killed in this battle, and would never return to the North.
==Etymology==
Though it is nowhere translated, Halbarad most likely means "Tall Tower", from Sindarin hall, "tall", and barad, "tower".
