Illuin was one of the Two Lamps of the Valar, made by Aulë, filled by Varda and hallowed by Manwë in ancient days to bring light to the world. It was destroyed by Morgoth, and where it fell it created the inland Sea of Helcar. It was set up in the northern part of Middle-earth while the other Lamp, Ormal was set up in the south.
