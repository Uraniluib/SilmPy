The Plateau of Gorgoroth was a high desolate plain in north-western Mordor enclosed by the Ephel Dúath on the west and the Ered Lithui on the north. The only known passages into the plateau through these mountain walls were the Carach Angren (from Udûn (valley) and the Morannon), Cirith Ungol, and the Morgul Vale. To the south-east, between two arms of the mountain ranges, was a gap that opened upon the land of Nurn.
In this dreary wasteland fumes issued from fissures in the ground and smoke curled and settled in hollows. Centred in the desolation some forty miles east of the Ephel Duath rose Mount Doom. It and Barad-dûr, situated on a spur of the Ered Lithui, dominated the landscape of the plateau.
==History==
c.  Sauron selected Mordor as his stronghold and began building Barad-dûr above the plateau.
In  the host of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men entered Gorgoroth and began their siege of Saurons fortress, during which (in ) Anárion was slain. After seven years the siege ended when Sauron was defeated and his The One Ring was taken.
Sauron returned to Mordor in  and began rebuilding Barad-dûr, which had been torn down after his defeat in the Second Age.
When Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee first looked upon Gorgoroth (on 16 March ) they spied innumerable camps of Men made of huts and drab buildings, connected by a network of roads. In this region were Saurons mines and forges for equipping his vast armies.
On 19 March, after escaping the Orcs at the Isenmouthe, the hobbits travelled on the road to Barad-dûr along the northern edge of Gorgoroth. Three days later they left the road and headed south across the plateau to Mount Doom, reaching it on 24 March.
