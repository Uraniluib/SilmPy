Mount Rerir was a mountain on the western side of the Ered Luin, in Thargelion (a region of Beleriand) to the north of Helevorn, and it was one of the sources of Gelion.
==History==
The land around the mountain belonged to Caranthir, who built a fortress on its western slopes. The fortress was lost during Dagor Bragollach. Elven forces probably withdrew from the area after the battle, and most definitely after Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
After the War of Wrath, Rerir was apparently heavily damaged, and from the Second Age onward it was but only a shadow of its former size.
==Etymology==
Rerir is a name in an unknown language, and of an unknown meaning.
Robert Foster proposes the name is Sindarin., entry "Rerir"
==Inspiration==
Perhaps J.R.R. Tolkien re-used a name appearing in Norse mythology: in The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n, Wikipedia:Rerir is the name of the grandson of Wikipedia:Odin., p. 72
