The Sackville-Baggins Family was a branch of the Baggins Family.
==History==
Camellia Sackville was the daughter of the head of the Sackville Family.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 214 (late 1958, early 1959) She married Longo Baggins, the son of Mungo Baggins. Some time prior to the birth of their first son, Otho Sackville-Baggins, Camelias father died. As was the custom in the "younger" families when there was no male heir, the headship passed to the daughters eldest son. He would then use his mothers name, and add his fathers to it. Thus, the Sackville-Baggins branch was created.
Otho married Lobelia Sackville-Baggins of Hardbottle, and the two had one child, Lotho Sackville-Baggins. Despite being the heir of the wealthyJ.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 25 (January or February 1938) Sackville Family, the Sackville-Bagginses yearned for the headship of the Baggins Family, and more specifically, their residence, Bag End.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit, "The Return Journey" After the disappearance of Bilbo Baggins, the Sackville-Bagginses made an unsuccessful claim at the headship, but it was already passed to Frodo Baggins.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, "An Unexpected Party" 
==Genealogy==
The Sackville-Bagginses were descendants of Mungo Baggins, like Bilbo. They considered themselves the heir of the Baggins Family headship because Frodo Baggins was the descendant of Largo Baggins, Mungos younger brother.The Sackville-Baggins family tree.





==Etymology==
Sackville was the name of a relatively young Hobbit family. Their name had an association with Baggins in that both contained an element for "bag/sack"; Sackville was a slightly more aristocratic version.J.R.R. Tolkien, Wayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull (eds.), Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings, published in: Wayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page 762 Tom Shippey argued that this "similarity" also provoked an antonymy: Bag End was used around England as a replacement of French cul-de-sac, "dead end street" - even Tolkiens own aunt Jane Neave lived in a house of that name. Tolkien did not like the Norman conquest of Britain, and made the Bagginses English. The name Sackville, however, is very Norman, as one of the few, if not the only, Hobbit family name.Tom Shippey, J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century, page 10
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In J.R.R. Tolkiens manuscript of The Hobbit the Sackville-Baggins were called the Allibone Baggins., p. 691  John D. Rateliff stated that the change to "Sackville" was penciled in about the time the story was being prepared for publication in 1936.  The significance of "Allibone" is unknown although Mr. Rateliff thought it might relate to Alboin, a character in The Lost Road., Text Note 14, p. 699
