Lothlann, a "wide and empty" plain, lay to the east of Ard-galen and north of East Beleriand, beyond the March of Maedhros and Maglors Gap. 
In the Dagor Bragollach the riders of the people of FÃ«anor were overwhelmed in Lothlann when the Dragons Glaurung came and passed through Maglors Gap. Many of Maglors cavalry were burnt alive on the plain as Morgoth set fire to it.
As with most of Beleriand, it was drowned by the Great Sea at the end of the First Age.
==Etymology==
The name means "empty and wide". In The Etymologies the name is identified as Noldorin and spelled Lhothlann according to the earlier conception, with the "Lh" later being dropped in favour of "L" in Sindarin. It is derived from the Noldorin elements lhost "empty" and lhand/lhann *"wide".
In that document the name appears both as Lhothland and Lhothlann, but under the entry LUS it also appears in its later form Lothlann., entries LUS, LAD
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
