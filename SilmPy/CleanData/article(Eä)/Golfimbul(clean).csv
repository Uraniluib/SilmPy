Robert Foster notes that the connection with the English word "golf" suggests that the name is either fictitious or translated Westron., p. 167
==Other versions of the legendarium==
At an early stage in writing The Hobbit J.R.R. Tolkien used the name "Fingolfin" for the Goblin-leader, which also contained the word "golf" for the joke about the origin of the game (although not as prominently as in "Golfimbul")., p. 39  Many years later, in the never-finished 1960 rewrite of the story, J.R.R. Tolkien intended to change the name to "Gulfimbul"., p. 776  John D. Rateliff speculated that this was either a further evolution of Tolkiens languages or because he was dropping the golf-joke reference, note 24, p. 785 (the 1960 revision was an effort to "upgrade" The Hobbit to the same epic level as The Lord of the Rings).
