Lotho Sackville-Baggins ( - , died aged 55) was the only child of Otho Sackville-Baggins and Lobelia Sackville-Baggins Sackville-Baggins Family.  For a short time at the end of the Third Age he assumed illegal control of the Shire.
==History==
After Lothos father, Otho, died in , Lotho inherited his pipe-weed plantations in the Southfarthing, ensuring his status as a wealthy Hobbit.
On 23 September  Lotho and Lobelia arrived at Bag End after lunch to take stock of the property and to obtain the keys.  Soon thereafter they moved into the residence and Lotho began a programme of buying an excessive amount of property and goods.  The goods were carted away to the south by Men ("ruffians") from Isengard.  When people began to complain about shortages the ruffians proceeded to assert Lothos power over the Shire.  When Will Whitfoot, the rightful Mayor of the Shire, set out to protest against Lothos activities the ruffians captured him and incarcerated him in the "Lockholes". With Whitfoot out of the way, Lotho began calling himself Chief Shirriffs, or simply Chief.  Among the Hobbits Lotho was known as Pimple.
Lothos "reign" over the Shire ended in September  when Saruman (called "Sharkey") arrived in the Shire and took over Bag End.  Soon Lothos mother, Lobelia, was taken to the Lockholes and Lotho was no longer seen in public.  When Saruman was ousted by Frodo and his companions, he revealed that Gríma had stabbed Lotho in his sleep.
==Etymology==
The name Lotho represents an original Hobbitish Westron name Lotha which was meaningless in contemporary speech.
