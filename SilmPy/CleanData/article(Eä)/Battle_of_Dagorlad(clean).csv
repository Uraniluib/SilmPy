The Battle of Dagorlad occurred in the year  of the Second Age. It was fought between the army of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men under Gil-galad and Elendil and an army of Orcs and other creatures loyal to Sauron. The battle took place on the great, treeless, open plain between the Dead Marshes and Cirith Gorgor. 
== History ==
===Prelude===
The united host of Elves and Men crossed the Misty Mountains and marched south through the vale of Anduin, where they were joined by the Silvan Elves led by AmdírIn the text in the Unfinished Tales Amdír is named Malgalad. and Oropher, with a host from Moria.
The Alliance entered the vast plain near the Black Gate, where they were joined by Anárions forces from the south, and confronted at last the black legions of Mordor.
The Silvan Elves had little sympathy for the Sindar and Noldor that were led by Gil-galad. As a result they were indisposed to place themselves under the supreme command of the High King of the Noldor. 
===The Battle===
During preliminary skirmishing, the Silvan Elves defying Gil-galads command, rashly charged against the numerous host of Mordor, before the King had given the order. The Silvans were valiant and doughty, but ill-equipped compared to their nobler kin. Oropher perished in the first onslaught while Amdír and his troops were cut off and driven into the marshes where half of his host perished. This area became known afterwards as the Dead Marshes, because of the thousands of bodies buried there. This battle raged for months. 
Elendil and Gil-galad eventually gained the upper hand. Thus Elves and Númenóreans finally pushed the enemy hordes back towards the Black Gate and broke through Cirith Gorgor.
===Aftermath===
A great part of Saurons soldiers was slain in this battle. The Alliance was able to enter Mordor, establish a camp upon the Plateau of Gorgoroth and lay the Siege of Barad-dûr itself. Nevertheless Sauron still had enough supplies to defend the fortress for seven more years, until the siege was so pressing that he himself came forth, which led to the battle on the slopes of Orodruin in which Sauron was defeated and the One Ring taken from him.
Orophers son Thranduil survived the war and established his reign over the Silvan Elves in the Woodland Realm.
The slain were buried and their graves eventually were engulfed by the Dead Marshes. 
In the Third Age, the Dagorlad was the site of several battles between Gondor and various Easterlings armies, and the climatic Battle of the Morannon.
