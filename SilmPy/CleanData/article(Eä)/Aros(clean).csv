Aros was a river of East Beleriand that formed much of the border of the Kingdom of Doriath.
It arose in the northern lands west of the Pass of Aglon in the Shadowy Spring, and flowed south between Dor DÃ­nen and Himlad; between these two lands the river could be crossed at Arossiach.  The rivers course then followed the eastern and, turning west, the southern boundaries of the Forest of Region; at that point it was joined by its main tributary, Celon. Aros then met the Sirion at Aelin-uial.
==Etymology==
The word Aros, derived from the Elvish Sundocarme YAR ("blood"), is said to be a "name of river with reddish water". The Noldorin form of the word was iaros., p. 400
