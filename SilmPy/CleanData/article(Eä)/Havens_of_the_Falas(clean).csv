Havens of the Falas (called Havens of Círdan by Voronwë, p. 32.) were the two great walled Elves cities: Eglarest at the mouth of the River Nenning, and to the north Brithombar at the mouth of the River Brithon. Built on the western shores of the Falas, the Havens were the realm of Círdan the Shipwright and his people, the Falathrim, who were considered Sindar.
The Havens were besieged during the First Battle of Beleriand, but during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath the Orcs that besieged the cities turned north to fight the Noldor and were all slain.  When Finrod established himself in Nargothrond his rule extended over all of West Beleriand excepts for the coasts, which continued to be ruled by Círdan, Felagunds ally. Thanks to the alliance between the Falathrim and the Elves of Nargothrond, the Havens were built as fair towns and fortified behind great walls.
The Havens of the Falas held out during the later Battles of Beleriand until they were finally destroyed in , and Círdans people fled to the Mouths of Sirion and the Isle of Balar.
