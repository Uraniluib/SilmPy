Rhosgobel was the "old home" of Radagast. The house is said to have been located between the Carrock and the Old Forest Road, on the western borders of Mirkwood, Note 4 and near its southern borders., p.305This location for Rhosgobel appears on the first map of The Lord of the Rings in The Treason of Isengard. A dot and the name are near the center of square L-13 on Map II, placing Rhosgobel east and a little south of the Gladden Fields.
After the Council of Elrond, some scouts from Rivendell passed over the Misty Mountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast was not there.
==Etymology==
Rhosgobel, glossed as "russet village or town (enclosure)",, p. 241 is evidently a compound of rhosc ("brown") and gobel ("walled house or village, town"). pp. 380, 385 The name of the house was perhaps a reference to its resident, the Brown Wizard.
