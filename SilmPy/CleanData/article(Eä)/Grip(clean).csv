Grip was a large wolf-like Dogs, one of three kept by Farmer Maggot on his farm at Bamfurlong in the Marish. Like Maggots other dogs, Fang (dog) and Wolf (dog), Grip was ferocious by nature, but also completely obedient to his master. Grip was with Maggot when they encountered one of the Nazgûl searching for Baggins Family, and at that time his obedience and ferocity failed: he yelped in terror and ran from the Nazgûl.
