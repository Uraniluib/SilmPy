Amdir was a Sindarin word literally meaning "looking up". It was used to describe a concept similar to the ideas of "hope" or "optimism". Amdir is more closely defined in the Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth as "an expectation of good, which though uncertain has some foundation in what is known". Amdir was often contrasted with Estel (philosophical concept), which is a more deeply grounded type of hope.
