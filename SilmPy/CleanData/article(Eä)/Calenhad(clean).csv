Calenhad was the penultimate Warning beacons of Gondor of Gondor, being the sixth from east to west and located to south-east of Firienholt.
Calenhad is described as being a small, green, treeless hill which was slightly bigger and taller than Erelas., pp. 19-20 Calenhad was seldom lit and its lighting during the War of the Ring indicated great urgency.
On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
== Etymology ==
It is suggested in the Unfinished Tales that Calenhad probably means "green space" from calen "green" and sad (lenition to had) "place, spot". In "The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor" J.R.R. Tolkien suggested that the second element may be s√¢dh "sward, turf".
