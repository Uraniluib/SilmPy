The Great Horn was an heirloom of the House of Húrin until its destruction on 26 February .
The horn was made from the wild white Kine of Araw of Rhûn, which was likened to an wikipedia:Aurochs., page 265 It was white itself, tipped with silver and inscribed with ancient characters. It was said in legend that if the Horn was blown anywhere within the bounds of ancient Gondor, its call would not pass unheeded.
==History==
The Great Horn was made from the horn of a Cows of Rhûn. Vorondil the Hunter, the father of Mardil, hunted the beasts in the far fields of the East. So, after Mardil Voronwë it passed down to every eldest son. From Denethor, it passed down to Boromir, who wore it with him on a baldric.
Boromir bore the horn with him when he went to Rivendell, and held it on his lap during the Council of Elrond. After he was chosen to be one of the Fellowship of the Ring, he let the horn ring through Rivendell. He would wind the horn twice more. In reply to the meager horns of the Orcs in Moria, the Great Horn bellowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. Though it repelled the attackers for a while, they returned after the last echo disappeared. 
The last time the horn was rung was shortly before its destruction, on 26 February, on the slopes of Amon Hen, near Parth Galen. While fighting, Boromir created a sound so loud that it could be heard in Minas Tirith. Sadly, the little help that could come - the rest of the Fellowship - could not make it in time. Though the Uruk-hai were at first dismayed and drew back, they returned more fierce than ever. In the fight that cost Boromirs life, the horn was cloven in two. 
Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas laid it in the elven boat with Boromir and his weapons and sent it down the falls of Rauros. The two parts of the horn fell out of the boat, and were found several days later. One was found in the reeds near the mouths of Entwash on 28 February, the other further down the river on 30 February., page 469 They were brought to Denethor, who held them on his lap, anxiously waiting for news of his beloved son. Those answers came, eventually, when Gandalf brought Peregrin Took, witness to Boromirs last stand, before the Steward.

Though generally referred to in fanfiction"Eambar", "http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4610337/1/The_Horn_of_Gondor The Horn of Gondor", http://www.fanfiction.net/ FanFiction.net and adaptations as the Horn of Gondor, this name does not appear in published writing. It is generally referred to simply as "the horn of Boromir", "The Window of the West" as he was its most notorious (and last) bearer. The only capitalized name is "Great Horn", however.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, page 174
==Inspiration==
One of the many similarities between wikipedia:Roland, the paladin of Charlemagne, and Boromir is that both bore a white horn.Gerard Seaman, "Old French Literature", published in J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia (edited by Michael Drout), page 468-9 Like Roland in battle with the Saracens blew his horn to call for Charlemagne, Boromir called for Aragorn. In both cases, help came too late.Wayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page 359
