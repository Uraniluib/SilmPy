The Line of Elros was a document that listed the names of the King of Númenor and Ruling Queen of Númenor of Númenor, and contained a brief account of their birthdate, length of rule, death date, and a summary of events that occurred during their reigns. The Line of Elros was probably made in Middle-earth (most likely in Gondor) after the Downfall of Númenor, as it contains a reference to Elendils writing of the Akallabêth, which is an account of that disaster.
