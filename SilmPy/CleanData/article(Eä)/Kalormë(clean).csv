Kalormë was a great mountain in Oronto (the farthest East of the world). The peak seems to have been the second tallest mountain in Arda, corresponding to the Oiolossë far in the Aman., pp. 212, 225
==Etymology==
In the Qenya Lexicon, the name kalorme(e) is glossed as "hill-crest over which the Sun rises"., p. 44, pp. 256-7
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In later works, Kalorme is not mentioned. However the Land of the Sun was marked by a great, curve-shaped mountain range called the Walls of the Sun, which corresponded symmetrically to the Pelóri of Aman.
==Inspiration==
It is notable that the name Kalormë is similar to http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Calormen Calormen of The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, althought it is unknown if J.R.R. Tolkien thought of this name.
