==Etymology==
The name Ettenmoors consists of etten (derived from Old English eōten "Giants, troll") and moor ("high barren land").
The name Ettenmoors is similar to the land of http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Ettinsmoor Ettinsmoor of The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.
"Fells" translates to hills or moorland, thus "troll-fells" were hills in which trolls lived., p. 183
The first instance of troll-fells was devoid of a dash and was capitalized, "Trollfells": J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on a map: "Alter Entish Lands to Trollfells > Bergrisland > Ettenmoor". This is also the first mention of Ettenmoor(s) in the legendarium., p. 306
