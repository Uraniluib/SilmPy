Elendë was the region of Aman east of the mountains of the Pelóri where the Elves dwelt, also known as Eldamar and as Elvenhome. Its chief cities were Tirion, where the Noldor and the Vanyar dwelt together in ancient times, and Alqualondë, the Alqualondë of the Teleri.
After the rebellion of the Noldor and the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Fëanor led a great part of the Noldor out of Elendë, north along shorelands scattered with jewels and crystals. His half-brother Finarfin marched with him, but ultimately abandoned the northward journey. He returned at last to Eldamar, to rule as King over the few Noldor that remained in Tirion.
