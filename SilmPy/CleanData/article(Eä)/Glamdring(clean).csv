Glamdring was a sword, said to have belonged to Turgon, but best known as the weapon of Gandalf during the War of the Ring. It was known in Westron as the Foe-hammer, and Orcs knew it as Beater.
==History==
===Beater===
Glamdring was originally borne by Turgon, the King of Gondolin. He must have wielded it with strength during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad or the Fall of Gondolin, for the Orcs named it "Beater", and fled before it. Even up until the late Third Age, orcs of the Misty Mountains knew of this legendary sword,, "Over Hill and Under Hill" so it must have done some damage. 
The name most likely originated in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where it is said that Turgon "hewed his way to the side of Fingon". No other tales mention the actions of the sword, and it is unknown what happened to it during the Fall of Gondolin. Turgon perished as the Tower of the King fell on top of him, but of the fate of Glamdring nothing is told.
===Survival===
The sword survived roughly 6500 years from the Fall of Gondolin in  to its eventual rediscovery in . In that period, it traveled from Gondolin to a Trolls Cave in the Trollshaws of Eriador, far in the East. Much mystery surrounds this feat, but Elrond reasoned that Glamdring (along with Orcrist and Sting) was plundered from other plunderers, or carried off to the Misty Mountains soon after the Fall of Gondolin.
===At Gandalfs side===
In May , Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins and Thorin and Company encountered three trolls in the Trollshaws - William, Bert and Tom. The Trolls captured Bilbo and the Dwarves, but Gandalf destroyed them by exposing them to sunlight. Glamdring, along with Orcrist and Sting, were found in their cave nearby. Gandalf claimed the weapon as his own, amazed by its appearance and inscription. The inscription was set in a script of runes Gandalf Gondolinic Runes; he needed the knowledge of Elrond for that. Elrond translated the runes, and called it by its Mannish name: "Foe-hammer".

Gandalf would use the sword well; its first victim was the Great Goblin. Other Orcs fled as they recognized the sword as "Beater". This would have meant that either some Orcs were at the Fall of Gondolin (which is unlikely, given the short lifespan of Orcs), or that they had legends about two glowing swords - Beater and Orcrist. Whether Gandalf used the sword again during the The Hobbit is uncertain, though it is likely that he wielded it in the Battle of Five Armies. 
Gandalf bore Glamdring at his side when the Fellowship of the Ring left Rivendell in . He used the blade during the Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul, and a short time thereafter in the standoff with Durins Bane. After the collapse of the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf and the Balrog fought on to the Endless Stair and Durins Tower, but in his recollection of the event he does not tell whether he used Glamdring or his staff in the Battle of the Peak.
Gandalfs spirit perished there, but was sent back because his task was not yet complete. He had Glamdring with him when he met the Three Hunters; he gave it to Háma at Edoras, when asked to surrender it. Gandalf would continue to bear it throughout the War of the Ring, and carried it at his side when he, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took arrived at the Prancing Pony in Bree. Gandalf and the Hobbits had seen so much war at the time that wearing a weapon did not seem odd.
===Fate===
On 29 September, , Gandalf left Middle-earth and sailed into the West. Whether he took Glamdring with him is never mentioned, and is open to debate. It can be argued that he brought it over the Sea, like he did with Shadowfax,J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 268 (dated 19 January, 1965) and because he had been carrying the sword for over 80 years.
==Appearance==
Glamdring and Orcrist are described in The Hobbit as having "beautiful scabbards and jeweled hilts". They would glow blue in the presence of Orcs. The "sword of Turgon" (not directly identified as Glamdring) had "a white and gold sword in a ruel-bone (ivory) sheath"., note 31
===Rune inscription===

When he took the sword, Gandalf said he could not read the runes. Elrond did, however, as he was savant of all kinds of runes. 
A fitting explanation would be the "Gondolinic Runes", devised by Tolkien in either 1924 or 1930. This set of Runes was first published in 1992.First published in Mythlore 69, pages 20-25 (edited by Paul Nolan Hyde), analysed in issue 70, pages 23-24 (by Carl F. Hostetter). See also J.R.R. Tolkien, "Gondolinic Runes", in Parma Eldalamberon 15 (edited by Christopher Gilson), page 111-113 .
In 1960, Tolkien began a complete rewrite of the Hobbit in which he added the fact that Glamdring was covered in dark blood when Gandalf found it, explaining why the runes were unreadable until cleaned by Elrond., page 799
==Etymology==
The word Glamdring is a Sindarin name meaning Foe-hammer in Westron; it is comprised of two elements. The first element is Glamhoth. This word has a long history in Tolkiens mind, but always had evil connotations. In its earliest appearances, it meant "fierce hate",J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Gilson, Patrick H. Wynne (eds.), "Namelist to The Fall of Gondolin", in: Parma Eldalamberon 15 (edited by Christopher Gilson et. al.), page 25 but later, its meaning became "shouting, confused noise", and became (poetically) associated with Orcs (cf. glamhoth). The second element is dring, said to mean "hammer"., "The Etymologies" The sword was also given the crude name Beater by the Orcs.

===Films===
1977: The Hobbit (1977 film):
:Gandalf acquires Glamdring in the trolls cave. Elrond recognizes the sword at first glance; perhaps he simply deduces the fact that it was Glamdring because he had identified its mate Orcrist just before. After leaving Rivendell, Gandalf notably uses the sword only when rescuing Bilbo and the Dwarves from Goblin-town. 
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:On promotional art, Glamdring is portrayed as an ordinary longsword, with no inscription visible. In the movie itself, it goes unnamed, and is considerably shorter, only a one-handed sword.The Lord of the Rings (1978 film), "Gandalf Triumphant
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:Gandalf does not use a sword, only his staff. 
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):

2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Glamdring is a name given to the sword of Gandalf in the films promotional materials, but it is not named in the films.

When asked, Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens reacted jokingly that is was due to "budgetary cuts", and they had "not enough blue left".Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh (eds.), The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition), "A Journey in the Dark (scene)", Director Commentary
:The rune inscription is engraved in the cross-guard, and adds power to the sword. With this extra power Gandalf was able to defeat Durins Bane.Chris Smith, The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare, page 68-69 The actual inscription reads as thus: 
::"Turgon aran Gondolin tortha gar a matha i vegil Glamdring gûd daedheloth, dam an Glamhoth".
:This is Sindarin, and translates to "Turgon, king of Gondolin, wields, has, and holds the sword Glamdring, Foe of Morgoths realm, Hammer of the Orcs".
