Ae Adar Nín ("Pater noster" in Sindarin) is J.R.R. Tolkiens Sindarin translation of most of the Lords Prayer (disambiguation). He left the last two lines untranslated, but his notes show that he intended to use úthaes as the word for "temptation" (cognate with Quenya úsahtië). The poem can be read in Vinyar Tengwar 44 on pages 21-30, edited by Bill Welden.
Tolkiens notes on the poem, written on the back of a postcard, are reproduced on the cover of Tolkien Studies: Volume 4.
