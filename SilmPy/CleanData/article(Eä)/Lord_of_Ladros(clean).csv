The Lord of Ladros was a position over Ladros, a highland region of Dorthonion, held by men of the House of BÃ«or.  
The first Lord of Ladros was Boromir (Lord of Ladros), being given to him by Finrod because of his ancestors faithful service to the Elves. He was followed by his son Bregor and then his grandson Bregolas.  
After Dorthonion was overrun during the Dagor Bragollach and the death of Bregolas, Barahir took over the last of those faithful to him and fled out into the wilds of Dorthonion.
