The Corsair Wars were a long, predominately naval struggle between Kings and Stewards of Gondor and a series of renegade rebel forces based at Umbar and Pelargir. 
== Historical Background ==
The fortress haven of Umbar was founded by Númenórean colonists during the Second Age, during the peak of Númenorean power.  When Ar-Pharazôn landed in Middle Earth to challenge the power of Sauron, he landed at this heavily fortified port city.  After the Downfall of Númenor, these colonists continued to be influenced by Sauron, and showed great antipathy to the exile Kingdoms founded by the Faithful, Arnor and Gondor.  They became known forever afterward as the Black Númenóreans, battling Gondor by land and sea. It is likely that Umbar was conquered for Gondor under one of the Ship-Kings, possibly by Tarannon Falastur. During the reign of Earnil I and his son, Ciryandil, the Haradrim constantly laid siege to Umbar and in , Ciryandil himself was slain defending it. This caused his son to conquer Harad and eventually take the name Hyarmendacil I.
== Early Years ==
In the aftermath of the Kin-strife, the great civil conflict between Eldacar (King of Gondor) and the usurper Castamir, Castamirs sons fled to Umbar.  There they established a breakaway government in opposition to Gondor, and continued to clash with Gondor for centuries to come.
== Pelargir Battles ==
In , Hyarmendacil II conquered Harad when his father, Aldamir, was slain in a skirmish with the Corsairs. However, Umbar held out against Hyarmendacils attacks, but suffered greviously. 
In  the Corsair learnt that King Minardil, son of Hyarmendacil, was holidaying in the port city of Pelargir.
The Corsairs staged a surprise attack, and Minardil was slain before he could organise a proper defence of the port. The Corsairs then made a sudden withdrawal.
Unfortunately for Gondor, Pelargir remained a prime target for the Corsairs throughout the rest of the Third Age and by the time of the War of the Ring, the city was a shadow of its former glory.
== Siege of Umbar ==
The Siege of Umbar may refer to several different events in history, when Umbar constantly changed hands between Gondor, and the Corsairs with their Haradrim allies. 
The first time Umbar was involved with the wars between Gondor and Harad was when one of the Ship-Kings conquered it from the Haradrim and Black Numenoreans who resided there. At this point, Harondor was still under Gondorian control so it can be assumed that perhaps Umbar was connected by land to Gondor, and not just a port outpost surrounded by enemies.
The wars with Harad never ceased and in  the Haradrim staged an assault on Umbar and King Ciryandil was slain defendings its walls. Although the port was not taken, it effected the Gondorian populace and above all else, Ciryaher, Ciryandils son. 35 years later, King Ciryaher not only lifted the Siege of Umbar, but conquered a huge portion of Near Harad, crushing the power of the Haradrim.
For the next four hundred years, Umbar was to remain in Gondorian control until after the Kin Strife, when the Sons of Castimir fled Pelagir and seized Umbar for their own. This proved to be the start of Gondors rapid decline.
Aldamir, son of Eldacar, still holding a grudge against Castimir and his sons for the murder of his brother in th burning of Osgilliath, assaulted Umbar and was slain in the process, but the Corsairs victory was soon avenged when Vinyarion, Aldamirs son, conquered Harad and laid siege to Umbar.
But Gondors temporary territorial claims in the south were soon reversed when the Gondorian siege of Umbar was lifted and the Corsairs raided Pelagir, killing King Minardil in the process.
Following the destruction of the Plague, both sides were temporarily weakened, but Telumehtar of Gondor struck first and conquered Umbar for Gondor, the last descendants of Castimir perished in the process.
It never states when the Corsairs reconquered Umbar, but it is likely that it fell back to the Corsairs sometime during the reigns of the next few Kings, when Gondor itself was nearly toppled by Wainriders.
