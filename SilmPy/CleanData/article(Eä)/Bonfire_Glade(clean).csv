Bonfire Glade was a reminder of the strange war that took place between the malevolent trees of the Old Forest and the Hobbits of Buckland, sometime between  and . 
The trees attacked the High Hay that protected the Bucklanders, and in retaliation, the Hobbits invaded the forest and burnt hundreds of trees in a huge bonfire. The Bonfire Glade was the place of that great burning, and even after many years, the trees left it an open and empty place.  
Meriadoc Brandybuck led Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took to the glade and out the other side on a path leading into the heart of the Old Forest.
