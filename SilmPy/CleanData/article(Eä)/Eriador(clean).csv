For the next thousand years Hobbits were little-affected by the dangers of the world around them as they grew large in both number and wealth. Despite the end of the Watchful Peace in  - with the passes across the Misty Mountains being barred by Saurons creatures - Eriador not was attacked by orcs until . Seven years later Bandobras Took led a group of hobbits in successfully defending the Shire against marauding orcs from Mount Gram led by Golfimbul in the Battle of Greenfields. Hobbits faced further hardship in  in the shape of the Long Winter which killed thousands of hobbits and resulted in a Days of Dearth; in  the Fell Winter (Third Age) began, freezing the rivers and bringing White Wolves from the north (in the floods which followed the city of Tharbad was destroyed).
=====War of the Ring=====
:See also: The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and War of the Ring
On 14 March, , a chance encounter between the wizards Gandalf and Kings of Durins Folk Thorin II Oakenshield in Bree set in motion a series of events which led to the downfall of Sauron and the establishment of the Reunited Kingdom. Thorin was seeking to regain his Thráins Lonely Mountain and Arkenstone was seeking assistance; Gandalf - worried about the threat of the dragons Smaug - agreed to assist, and forcibly enlisted the help of Bilbo Baggins. As the Thorin and Company of fifteen (thirteen dwarves with Gandalf and Bilbo) travelled towards Rivendell they Roast Mutton - thanks to Gandalf they avoided death whilst managing to gain the two Elves swords Glamdring and Orcrist, and the dagger Sting. Out of this quest Bilbo obtained Gollums The One Ring.

Following Bilbos Farewell Party in , Bilbos "nephew", Frodo Baggins, inherited all of Bilbos possessions, including Bilbos ring. Bilbo travelled through Eriador, eventually staying with Elrond in Rivendell, whilst Frodo continued to live in Bag End. However, by , Frodo, with Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, is forced to set out from the Shire to head towards Bree in order to deliver what is now known to be the One Ring; on the way, the Hobbits encounter the Nazgûl and Barrow-wights, as well as Farmer Maggot, Gildor and Tom Bombadil. In Bree, the Travellers met a man called "Aragorn", who had been sent to safely escort the hobbits to Rivendell; despite being attacked by Black Riders on Weathertop and again confronted by them at the Ford of Bruinen, they all eventually make it safely to Rivendell. At Rivendell, a Council of Elrond decides that Fellowship of the Ring should go on a quest to destroy the Ring.
After destroying the the One Ring, witnessing the downfall of Sauron and the coronation of "Strider" as Kings of Gondor Elessar of Gondor, the four hobbits and Gandalf returned to Eriador. Gandalf left the hobbits at the Old Forest - deciding to visit Tom Bombadil - but when they arrived at the Brandywine Bridge they saw that the Shire had been badly affected by Saruman via his puppet "Chief Shirriff" and the use of ruffians. After breaking many of the new "rules", the four hobbits were escorted to Hobbiton by a troop of Shirriffs (including Robin Smallburrow) where the four hobbits began a rebellion in the form of the successful Battle of Bywater: the ruffians were killed (as was Gríma) or captured and the Shire-hobbits were liberated (at the cost of The Roll).
Following the Battle of Bywater and the end of the War of the Ring, Frodo temporarily took the position of Deputy Mayor of Michel Delving whilst Sam used Sams garden box from Galadriel to replenish the Shire of its lost flora (bringing a Mallorn tree to the Party Field). On 21 September, , Frodo and Sam set out from the Shire to meet the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Three Keepers: on 29 September they reached the Grey Havens where Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, Galadriel and Elrond departed Middle-earth; the Red Book of Westmarch was left with Sam.
===Fourth Age===
In the year  of Shire Calendar the Fourth Age began following the departure of the Ring-bearers, the defeat of Sauron and re-establishment of Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south. In  Kings of Arnor Aragorn of Arnor makes the Shire a Free Land under the protection of the Sceptre of Annúminas and declares that no Men should ever enter the Shire. In  Elessar stays at Lake Evendim, meeting his friends at Brandywine Bridge; in  he gives the Westmarch - the area between the Far Downs and Tower Hills - to the Shire as well as officially adding Buckland to the Shire. In  Samwise Gamgee eventually passed over Belegaer and in  Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took leave the Shire and travel south to Rohan and Gondor.
It is unknown how many, if any, Elves were left in Eriador during the Fourth Age; presumably very few Noldor, at least.
==Etymology==
There are at least two, slightly different, versions of the etymology of Eriador:
#Eriador as Sindarin (derived from Noldorin), whose derivation is quoted by Carl F. Hostetter from an unnamed note dated 1949-53. This explains that Eriador is derived from eryā, "isolated, lonely" and Dôr, "land", thereby translating Eriador as "wilderness"."Letters to VT" in Carl F. Hostetter (ed.), Vinyar Tengwar, Vinyar Tengwar 42, July 2001, p. 4
#In another manuscript, Tolkien stated that Eriador was a Silvan Elvish name, meaning "Lonely land" (deriving from *eryā, S eir, air)., p. 28
Both translations are noticeably similar to the "Lone-lands" mentioned in The Hobbit; it is unknown whether they are the same or simply coincidental.
==In Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier sketches of the maps of Middle-earth Eriador is originally called "Forodwaith" - the name which is now applied to the Forodwaith (lands) to the north of Middle-earth., pp. 305-306
