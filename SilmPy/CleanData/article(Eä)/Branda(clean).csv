__NOTOC__
branda in Telerin means "lofty, noble, fine". 
==Etymology==
Primitive Elvish (perhaps Common Telerin) was brandâ, The Etymologies p. 351, apparently representing an even more primitive adjective *barándâ (stem BARAT).
----
branda in Westron means "border, march". The Hobbitish name Brandagamba (translated as Brandybuck) is derived from this word and the ending -gamba. Though a better translation of the name would be "Marchbuck," Tolkien translated it "Brandybuck" in order to retain the connection with the Brandywine River.
----
Perhaps it comes from a possible Adûnaic *barrad, root BAR.
