: Water Drakes, or Water Serpents, are drakes who have adapted to a life in freshwater pools or in the ocean. The smaller varieties, who only live in fresh-water, are called Rain-drakes (or Lake-worms), while the larger (who prey in all types of water) are called True Water-drakes or Sea Serpents., pp. 116-117 An individual Water-drake, Séahmatha (meaning "Lake Serpent" in the tongue of the Northmen), inhabits the Long Lake., pp. 121-128
