The Blacklocks were one of the seven houses of the Dwarves that dwelt in the mountains of the East. They were originally paired with the Stonefoots., pp. 301, 322 (note 24)
It is possible that the Blacklocks were among the "Houses of other Fathers" who sent troops to help Durins Folk in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
: The unnamed Dwarven tribes were given invented names in an early supplement. While these were published before the publication of Tolkiens late note on the name of the Dwarven houses of the East, it has been suggested that the Blacklocks could correspond to Dr√∫ins Tribe (as portrayed in Middle-earth Role Playing).Thomas Morwinsky, "A Brief History of the Dwarven Mansions", in Other Minds issue 4 (July 2008)
2002-5: The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game:
: The House corresponding to the Blacklocks is called Vars Folk, said to wander the lands of the East and South. Their beards are "black as coal and thick as wire, often left tangled ad unkempt".
