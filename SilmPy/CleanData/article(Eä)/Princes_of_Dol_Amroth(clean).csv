Prince of Dol Amroth was a title used by a noble house of Gondor. 
==History==
===Origins===
A family of Faithful from Númenor had ruled over the land of Belfalas since the Second Age. This family of Númenóreans were akin to the Lords of Andúnië, and thus related to Elendil.  After the Downfall of Númenor they had been given the title Prince by Elendil, Note 39 and their land, now a fief of Gondor, was called Dor-en-Ernil. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas.
One branch of their descendants removed to Lossarnach. Morwen Steelsheen, a daughter of that family, married Thengel of Rohan. Through Morwen, both Thengels heir Théoden and his grandson Éomer carried the blood of the ancient Princes of Belfalas.
One of those princes, Adrahil I, fought under King of Gondor Ondoher against the Wainriders.Adrahil is mentioned as a "Prince of Dol Amroth" in the narrative, but this is anachronistic as the city was named Dol Amroth much later. Cf. Adrahil I#Other versions of the legendarium
When an Elven stronghold was abandoned, those Gondorians came to occupy it, and named it Dol Amroth after the drowning of the Elven King Amroth. The first Prince of Dol Amroth was Galador, who, according to legend, was the son of Mithrellas, an Elf maid. This supposed elven strain was noticed in Imrahil many years later by Legolas.
