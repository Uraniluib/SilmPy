The Tree of Tongues is a sketch by J.R.R. Tolkien found in the chapter "The Lhammas" of The Lost Road and Other Writings. It shows the relationship between the multitude of languages described in that section of the book. Three similar sketches entitled Table of the Descent of Tongues are included with the Tengwesta Qenderinwa, some dating later than those in The Lhammas., pp. 28-9, 81
The later revisions of the legendarium show a considerably different and a bit simplified history of the languages. For example, we know from The Silmarillion that the Elvish languages do not descend from Valarin, taught to them by Oromë, but from Primitive Quendian, spoken before Oromë found the Elves.
