The Oath of Eorl, also called the Oath of Cirion,, p. 20 was the alliance sworn between the nations of Rohan and Gondor. 
Also agreed was whenever help was needed, the two kingdoms would aid each other. The signal that help was needed was the Red Arrow, a symbol of danger. For faster communication between the two allies, the warning beacons of Gondor were used. These beacons were placed on seven hills along the northern ridge of the White Mountains.

The Oath was first sworn in  by Cirion, the twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor, and by Eorl, King of the Éothéod (later first King of Rohan) following the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. The Oath stated that the province of Calenardhon would be forever of Rohan, established its borders, and an alliance between the kingdoms.  The two rulers swore their oaths on the Halifirien hill at the site of the Tomb of Elendil.
Eorl spoke his oath in Rohirric: 

In addition to his oath, Cirion spoke an invocation in Quenya and the Westron, calling the Valar and Ilúvatar to witness the oaths that were taken.  

Erus name was very rarely invoked in oaths, and indeed had not been since the time of the Last Alliance.  Among people of Numenorean descent, it was held that only the King could call upon Eru, but Cirion had that authority as Steward and regent for the King.
==History of the Oath==
In  King Déor asked the help of Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor) to drive off the Dunlendings from the occupied Ring of Isengard, but a renewed war against the Orcs prevented the Steward from fulfilling the Oath.
During the rule of Beren (Steward of Gondor), both nations where overwhelmed; Gondor by the Corsairs of Umbar and Rohan by the Dunlendings, and couldnt help each other. After the Long Winter however, as the Rohirrim started to repel the invaders, Gondor afforded sending help from both west and east of the White Mountains to assist them.
Gondor sent great help to King Folcwine who reconquered the Westmarch (disambiguation) from the Dunlendings. In , when Ithilien was invaded in great strength, Folcwine sent many men, led by his twin prince sons, to Gondor. With their aid Steward Túrin II won a victory at the Crossings of Poros, though the princes Fastred (son of Folcwine) and Folcred were slain.
During the War of the Ring, the Red Arrow was brought to King Théoden of Rohan by Hirgon while Minas Tirith was besieged by Sauron, and Théoden rode out with the Muster of Rohan to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. 
The Oath was renewed by Aragorn and Éomer upon their accessions to the thrones of Gondor and Rohan.
