Nellas was an Elves of Doriath, who lived in the woods near Menegroth. At the bidding of Melian, she became the friend and tutor of Túrin during his boyhood years in Doriath. It was from Nellas teaching that Túrin gained the Elf-like bearing and knowledge of Sindarin that led the people of Nargothrond to give him the name Adanedhel, Elf-Man. After Túrins accidental slaying of Saeros, it was Nellas account that earned him the forgiveness of the King (though he did not know this, having already exiled himself from the Doriath)., Túrin in Doriath
