Formenos (Quenya, pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin ; Years of the Trees 1490, §99 – 1495,, §122 inhabited for approx. 50 years) was the stronghold of Fëanor and his Sons of Fëanor in the north of Valinor, built after his banishment from Tirion. A great number of the Noldor, including their king Finwë, went with Fëanor into exile.
Fëanors treasury was in Formenos, and Morgoth came to the stronghold searching for the Silmarils. Here he slew Finwë before stealing the jewels and escaping to Middle-earth.
== Etymology ==
Formenos means "Northern Fortress" in Quenya (from formen = "north" and osto = "fortress").  Its Sindarin cognate is Fornost, the name of a different city.
