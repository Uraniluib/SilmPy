__NOTOC__
-wë (or -we) is a Quenya suffix used mainly in masculine names more usual in the First Age. It is translated as "man" or simply "person"., p. 340, p. 399, p. 398
It was seen in names of the Elves of Cuiviénen and the Great March: Morwë, Nurwë, Ingwë, Finwë, Elwë, Olwë, Nowë, Lenwë; and Aranwë. 
The ending was also seen in Manwë, and perhaps also in Eönwë. It could be that the ending also is found in the feminine name Elenwë.
==Etymology==
In the The Etymologies, -we derives from the Primitive Quendian ending -wego (from Sundocarme WEG).
In the later text "The Shibboleth of Fëanor", the ending derives from the stem EWE, which is also an ancient word for "person"., p. 340
==Cognates==
The element is seen in names of Quenya form which in turn perhaps represents Common Eldarin. The name ending did not seem to survive in later generations or in other languages; an exception is the element -u seen only in the name Elu (from *Elwego) who was better known as Thingol in Sindarin. The Elf Nowë became better known as Círdan.
Olwë became Olue in Telerin. Lenwë was known as Denweg.
