Onya is a Quenya word with two possible meanings: 
# a term of address simply meaning my son. Its only recorded use is between Meneldur and his son Tar-Aldarion, but there is reason to believe that it was more widely used, at least among noble Men. Its opposite was Atarinya, "my father", and we know that this was used by the Exiles of Númenor long after Meneldurs time, so its reasonable to assume that the word onya survived in use at least into the Third Age, too.
# a word for Ent.
