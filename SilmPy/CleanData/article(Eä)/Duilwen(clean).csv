The Duilwen was one of the six rivers that flowed west through Ossiriand to meet Gelion. The Duilwen was the last-but-one of these to flow into the great south-flowing river; only the Adurant was further south. 
==Etymology==
Duilwen can probably be considered as a Sindarin name,Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, entry "Duilwen"  but was originally conceived as Ilkorin by Tolkien, consisting of the Ilkorin elements duil ("river") and gwene ("green")., pp. 355 (DUI-), 359 (GWEN-) Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the element -wen is a "lenited and shortened form of gwene".
