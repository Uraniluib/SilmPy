Emyn Eglain, or the Hills of Eglamar, was a range of hills located in the land of the Falas in southwestern Beleriand. The hills only appear on a map and are never mentioned in any narrative., pp. 184, 189
==Etymology==
The name Emyn Eglain means "Hills of the Forsaken (Elves)" in Sindarin, from amon ("hill") and Falathrim#Names ("the Forsaken"). The name Eglamar is, as noted by Christopher Tolkien, "one of the oldest names in J.R.R. Tolkiens legendarium" (for other applications, cf. Eglamar (disambiguation)).
