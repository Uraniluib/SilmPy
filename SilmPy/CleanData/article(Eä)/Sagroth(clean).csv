Sagroth was one of the guards that Hardang, the Halad, had assigned to keep watch at the Haudh-en-Elleth.  He was the first to spot the sleeping Húrin  when he had come to that place.  A fellow guard, Forhend, said that Sagroth could be trusted to always find trouble, for he knew that Hardang would not be pleased with the discovery of Húrin within Brethil. , p. 274
Later, when Hardang wanted to send Manthor away while he dealt with Húrin, he told him to go until Captain Avranc came to take command (this was an on-the-spot promotion of Avranc).  Manthor immediately quit his service to Hardang and stated that he had left Sagroth, "a woodman older and wiser" than Avranc in command., p. 274
