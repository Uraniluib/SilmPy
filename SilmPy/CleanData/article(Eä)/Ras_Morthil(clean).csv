Ras Morthil was the last mountain on a southern spur of the White Mountains. It stood on the cape of Andrast. The mountain chain that ran along the length of the cape was, for a long time, the home of tribes of the Drúedain.  It may have been vacated by the end of the Third Age although the men of the Anfalas believed some of the Druédain still lingered there., Further notes on the Druédain
==Etymology==
Ras is a Sindarin word for "horn" (cf. Caradhras); Morthil likely contains the element mor, "dark, black".
