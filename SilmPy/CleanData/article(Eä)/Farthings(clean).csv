The four Farthings were four of the five (later six) divisions of the Shire. They were known simply as Northfarthing, Westfarthing, Southfarthing and Eastfarthing. The Westron word was tharni, the Sindarin word (presumably) canath., §41  
==Etymology==
In English a farthing (Old English feorðing "fourth part, quarter" > ferthing "a negligible amount") is a quarter of a penny.
In Shire geography used in the original sense "fourth part". J.R.R. Tolkien noted that the application to the divisions of the Shire to English ears has a perhaps comical effect.
==Inspiration==
The four Farthings of the Shire were based on the three traditional Thridings of Wikipedia:Yorkshire, which were formerly used as divisions of the county (wikipedia:North Riding of Yorkshire, wikipedia:West Riding of Yorkshire and wikipedia:East Riding of Yorkshire)., p. 770 (see also p. 32)
"Farthing" was used in Gloucestershire. Tolkien did not mention this in Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings, but it is likely he knew of its existence as his wife Edith Tolkien was born in Gloucestershire.
