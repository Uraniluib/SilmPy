2001-2007: The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game:
:A Decipher card identifies one of the Men at Bree in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring as the Squint-eyed Southerner.
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:A character credited as "Squint" appears in the prologue in Bree. Along with another character credited as "Bill Ferny Sr." (loosely based on Bill Ferny), Squint has seemingly tracked Thorin to the Prancing Pony (presumably to collect on the bounty put out on Thorins head). The two Men are preparing to confront Thorin when Gandalf goes over and sits and starts talking with the Dwarves. When it becomes apparent the Wizards is not going anywhere, Bill and Squint get up and leave the inn.
