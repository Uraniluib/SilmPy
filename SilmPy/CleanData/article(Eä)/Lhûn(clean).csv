The river Lhûn (Sindarin, pron. ) or Westronized Lune was a river of north-western Eriador. It gave its name to the Gulf of Lune and the Ered Luin. Of old, the Lhûn had been a line of defence: first against Sauron, and later against the Witch-king.
==Course==
The river Lhûn found its origin in the First Age or before. The river had its sources in the far north of the Blue Mountains, and had two tributaries: the Little Lune and an unnamed river that had its origin in the Hills of Evendim. 
Its original course is no longer recorded in history, but following the War of Wrath, its course was severely altered; after the breaking of the Blue Mountains, it flowed in the newly-formed Gulf of Lune. 
==History==
In the Second Age, the Lhûn formed the border between eastern Lindon and Arnor. Elendils Arnorians dwelt about the courses of the Lhûn. During Saurons advent, Gil-galad and Elendil were desperately protecting the Grey Havens, and managed to hold the Lhûn.
During the Angmar War, it formed the end of the Witch-kings influence: many of the Dúnedain fled across it. When Eärnil II came, passage was won back over it. With their defeat imminent, many of the Witch-kings minions drowned in the river Lhûn., "Gondor and the Heirs of Anarion"
==Etymology==
The meaning of Lhûn is not known. In connection with its first appearance, in a manuscript dating from ca. 1940, the translation "Blue River" is given., "VI. The Council of Elrond (1): The Third Version, (iii)", p. 124 Apparently, Tolkien originally envisioned it as Noldorin for "blue" (cf. Sindarin luin). (entry for LUG2-) Lhûn, and especially the initial /lh/, may have been valid in Noldorin, it was not so in Sindarin, so Tolkien had to rewrite the etymology. He considered the following:, pp. 136-7
* Common Eldarin Slōna, "floody"
* CE Slōnā, "in flood, full of water" (during melting season)
* CE Slounā, "flow freely"
* CE Slōno, "deep of water, applied originally to the Gulf!"
* A renaming to Sîr Luin, "Blue River"
* CE Slōn, "sound"
* A Khuzdul origin, salôn or sulûn, "fall, descend swiftly"
