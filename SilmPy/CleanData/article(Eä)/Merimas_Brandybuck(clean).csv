Merimas Brandybuck was a Hobbits of Buckland.
==History==
Merimas was the eldest child, and only son, of Marmadas Brandybuck. He was present at Bilbos Farewell Party.
==Etymology==
The name Merimas is, like most male Brandybuck names, Celtic in sound, but apparently meaningless. The first element, Meri, is similar to Meriadoc Brandybuck, and could, like in that name, have been based on Buckland Westron kali, "jolly, gay".
