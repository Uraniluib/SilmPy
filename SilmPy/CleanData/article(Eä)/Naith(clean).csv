The Naith of Lórien was a wedge-shaped land between the Rivers Celebrant and Anduin, where Egladil, the heartlands of Lothlórien lay, and its capital Caras Galadhon was found.
Gore was Haldirs translation of the Elvish name Naith.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin word naith, glossed as "angle", is derived from nek-tē (root NEK). Its Quenya form is nehte., p. 55 In The Etymologies the word is glossed as "gore" and appears as a Noldorin word (the procursor of Sindarin), derived from the roots SNAS-/SNAT-. Other words derived from that root have the meaning of "spear-head, point, triangle", including a sketch of an arrow-head.
The English gloss Wiktionary:gore#Etymology_3 is a rare word which describes any of a wide range of narrow or pointed items, originally a narrow triangular piece of land.
