===The Ancestors of Eorl the Young===
Eorl was the last Lord of the Éothéod, descended from the first Lord, Marhwini, who had settled his people in the Vales of Anduin after his father Marhari had died.  Marhari was in turn a descendant of Vidugavia., note 5  Thus the forefathers of Eorl claimed descent from the kings of Rhovanion and kinship with the kings of Gondor descended from Eldacar (King of Gondor).

===The First Line of the Kings of Rohan===
After the victory of Gondor and the Éothéod at the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, the Steward Cirion gave the land of Calenardhon to Eorl and his people.  Eorl swore the Oath of Eorl and brought the Éothéod to their new home, which they named Rohan.  Eorl thus became the first King of Rohan and began the First Line.
