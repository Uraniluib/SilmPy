Foresight is a gift or power apparently given to picked Elves and Men.  Many elves appear to have varying amounts of foresight, while some of the more noble men (Númenóreans/Dúnedain) appear to have degrees of foresight on special occasions. 
Elven mothers would give their children a name, known as amilessë, having insight into the characters and abilities of their children, and many also had the gift of prophetic foresight., Note on Mother-names, p. 339
There are several mentions of Seers or Prophets namely Amnon, Glirhuin and Malbeth. Foresight was also seen in dreams: Frodo Baggins saw prophetic dreams during his adventure, and Boromir and Faramir saw a puzzling dream, prompting Boromir to travel to Rivendell to seek counsel.
