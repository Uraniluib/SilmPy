Valaróma was the fabled hunting-horn of Oromë, the Huntsman of the Valar. It could be heard above all other horns, for its sound was like lightning cleaving the clouds, and its echoes made the shadows flee, even Melkor quail in Utumno.  When the Sindar heard it they knew that once again the hunter was pursuing the servants of Morgoth.  Only once did the sound of Valaróma falter - in the Cloud of Ungoliant after she had attacked the Two Trees.
