2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
: Azog is played by Manu Bennett via motion-capture and CG (though he was originally intended to be played by Conan Stevens in a practical costume and makeup).). He is a white-skinned Orc, known as the Pale Orc or Azog the Defiler. According to Balin, he is from Gundabad. In the movie, the Battle of Azanulbizar appears in a flashback. Thrór is still alive at this time and is beheaded by Azog during the battle. Thorin fights with Azog and cuts off his left forearm, and the Pale Orc is dragged off by a few fellow Orcs. Thorin believes Azog to have died from his wounds, but, unlike in the book, he actually survived the battle and serves as Thorins nemesis.
: In the films, Azog speaks exclusively in Orkish, whereas his literary counterpart was also known for using the Common Speech. He rides a gigantic Warg Matriarch. He also lacks the iron-clad head he featured in the books.
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
: Azog leads a pack of Orcs on Wargs in hunting down Thorin and Company to wipe out the House of Durin and to take his revenge on Thorin for his wound - even putting out a bounty on Thorins head. In the film, it is his pack (not the Orcs of Goblin-town) that catch up to the Company on the other side of the Misty Mountains; after a brief fight with Thorin, he loses them when they are rescued by the Eagles.
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
: While still in pursuit of Thorin and Company as they come down from the Carrock and make their way to Beorns house, he is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Sauron#Saurons Return himself to lead his armies to Lonely Mountain. He later leads an unsuccessful attack on Gandalf when the Wizards enters the fortress prior to the armies departures.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:

: In this movie, Azogs appearance is changed, as he now wears plate armor, and he replaced his claw arm with one that looks similar to a sword. Azog is first seen marching on Erebor. When Bolg tells him of the Elves of Mirkwood Army, he orders him to Gundabad for more troops. From Ravenhill, Azog commands the Orcs in the Battle of Five Armies. Thorin, Fíli, Kíli and Dwalin go to kill Azog, in order to leave the Orcs leaderless. But Azog captures Fíli and kills him in front of Thorin. Azog finally battles Thorin on a frozen lake and is knocked underwater. However, he breaks through the ice and stabs Thorin, mortally wounding him. Despite this, the Dwarf leader manages to stab Azog through the chest with Orcrist - finally killing the Pale Orc - shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.
