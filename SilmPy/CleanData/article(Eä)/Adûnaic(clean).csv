Adûnaic ("Language of the West") was the Númenórean language, spoken by the Men of Númenor during the Second Age.
==Origins and family==
Adûnaic was derived from the House of Hador tongue, related to the House of Bëor—collectively called Taliska. It was more distantly related to the languages of the Middle Men of the east, such as the Northmen. During the First Age these languages were much influenced by Khuzdul,, p. 317 Avarin, but also by the languages of the Eldar, as the Elf-friends spoke Sindarin.
Taliska was not related to the Haladin tongue at all, therefore when the Númenóreans returned to Middle-earth in the Second Age, they did not recognise the peoples of Enedwaith and Minhiriath as their distant kin, who spoke Pre-Númenórean languages.
==History==
Adûnaic was generally considered to be a language of less prestige than the Elvish. Most locations of Númenor, and most of the lords and ladies of the Dúnedain, had also Quenya or Sindarin names beside their native ones. Even most commoners knew Sindarin to some degree. 
Most of the House of Bëor had been killed after the Dagor Bragollach, but even during the Second Age a Bëorian accent of Adûnaic still survived in parts of Númenor, most notably in Emerië and around the harbour of Andúnië.
===Days of Pride===
About 2,000 years into the Second Age, the Númenóreans began to envy the immortality of the Firstborn, which extended to the languages of the Elves; the Kings and their Kings Men used the Elven tongues less and less. Though the Kings and Queens had all taken their names in Quenya, after some time their supporters used their Adûnaic names to refer to them. 
Eventually Ar-Adûnakhôr took his name in Adûnaic and forbade anyone to speak the Elven tongues in his presence. Adûnaic was now the language of the royal court. Its supremacy was most strongly enforced by Ar-Gimilzôr: he outlawed the use of Elvish anywhere in Númenor, which antagonized the few Faithful Númenóreans still living in the land.
However, his son Inziladûn took a Quenya name again, Tar-Palantir, repealed the ban on the Elven tongues and gave peace to the Faithful. His daughter Tar-Míriel would probably have continued his reforms, but her cousin Ar-Pharazôn seized power and, in addition, gave her an Adûnaic name (Ar-Zimraphel).
===Decline===
With the Downfall of Númenor came the end of classical Adûnaic. The study and preservation of the language was neglected by the Exiles of Númenor, because they associated it with the rebellious and repressive Númenórean Kings., p. 315 
However, the Men of Middle-earth who descended from the early Númenórean sailors and colonists still spoke it as a Wikipedia:creole language. This language eventually evolved into the Westron tongue widely spoken during the Third Age.
