The Alley of Roses was a street in Gondolin, the northern entrance to the Square of the Palace.  During the Fall of Gondolin it was burned and destroyed by Fire-drakes.  It is mentioned in the Fall that it was once a fair place to walk in, and it can be assumed from its name that it was a sort of garden-street bordered by roses., p. 183
