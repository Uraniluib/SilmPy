hantalë (or hantale) is a Quenya noun meaning "Thanksgiving". Note that the word only appears in the compound Eruhantalë ("Thanksgiving to Ilúvatar").
==Etymology==
The word obviously contains the suffix -le which is typically used to derive nouns from verbs.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/affix~1.htm Quenya affixes" at http://folk.uib.no/ Ardalambion If so, the core of the word is a possible verb *hanta- "give thanks" to which -le is suffixed.
The words hantale and *hanta- possibly derive from the root HAN "increase, honor". p. 14
