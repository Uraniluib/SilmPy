Lord of the Ring or Lord of the Rings was a title for Sauron, the master of the One Ring. The singular form appeared only once, uttered by Peregrin Took, who was ignorant of its meaning. The plural form appeared only thrice; once in Gandalfs correction of the above mishap, once by Glorfindel during the Council of Elrond, and once by Gandalf there.
