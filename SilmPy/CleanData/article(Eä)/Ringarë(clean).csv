Ringarë was the last month of the year according to the Kings Reckoning and Stewards Reckoning of Gondor, and the ninth month according to the New Reckoning. Ringarë in the Kings and Stewards Reckoning corresponded to Foreyule in the Shire Calendar (approximately modern 21 November through 20 December). The Sindarin name was Girithron.
==Etymology==
The word obviously contains the word ringa "cold". David Salo notes that the ending might be also seen in the abstract nouns almare "blessedness" and fanyare "the skies". Therefore the meaning of Ringare is equivalent to "*coldness".
