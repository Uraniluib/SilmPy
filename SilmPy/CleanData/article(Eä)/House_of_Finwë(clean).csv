Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - Finwe Heraldic Device.jpgThe House of Finwë was a large Noldorin royal house that held the High_King_of_the_Noldor.  Its device was that of a great golden sun, even though Finwë was slain before the Sun was made.
The House of Finwë had three main branches, one for each of the first Noldórans sons; the House of Fëanor, the House of Fingolfin and House of Finarfin.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Finwës two daughters dont appear in the published Silmarillion.
In earlier versions of the legendarium, Finwë and Indis had three daughters: Findis, Faniel and Finvain. It remains unclear if the third daughter survived in the final conception of Finwës family tree., note 26
