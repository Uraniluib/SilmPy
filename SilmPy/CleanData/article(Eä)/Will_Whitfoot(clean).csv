Since the Free Fair is septennial, Will must have been Mayor since the last Fair before  (3020-7=). However, as we are not told that was his first term, its possible that he might already been serving since  or even earlier. See , p. 428, entry "Will Whitfoot".
He was renowned as being the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, and was affectionately referred to as "Flourdumpling" after he emerged from the collapse of the Town Hole covered in chalk. 
He was one of the first victims of the new rule of Lotho Sackville-Baggins and Sharkey. He went to protest against Lothos felling of trees, but was apprehended by Ruffians on his way to Bag End. He was locked up in the Lockholes, and Lotho usurped his title. He was freed after the Battle of Bywater, but was at first unfit for duty as Mayor, so Frodo Baggins served as Deputy Mayor. He was officially restored as Mayor on the next Free Fair, on Midyears Day of .
Will Whitfoot resigned in , and was succeeded by Samwise Gamgee.
