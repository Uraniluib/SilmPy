Breredon (Briar Hill) was a little village in Buckland near Haysend on rising ground behind the hythe, or small landing, on the north bank of the Withywindle in the narrow tongue between the south end of the High Hay and the Baranduin River.
==Etymology==
It has been suggested that Breredon is consisting of the elements brere ("wikipedia:Brier") + -don ("down, hill").Andreas Möhn, "http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bombadil_in_the_Shire.html Bombadil in the Shire" at http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/M-earth.html Middle-earth Science Pages (accessed 16 March 2011)
This etymology would represent a possible Old English form *Braerdun "hill of briers".
