Vampires were mysterious bat-like creatures in the service of Morgoth and of Sauron. The only vampire whose name is recorded in the annals of Arda is Saurons servant Thuringwethil, but Sauron himself took the form of a vampire on at least one occasion, to flee Huan.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
1989: Middle-earth Role Playing (Dark Mage of Rhudaur):
:Vampires are described as former Maiar patrons of normal bats, but corrupted by Morgoth and transformed into demons appearing as man-sized bats with "the faces of hideous Men or Women", having the ability to change shape., p. 91 A related creature is also envisioned, the Blood-wight, which is an undead Men shapechanger, draining blood from living beings.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:A new creature created for the game, the Merrevail (singular, Morroval) appear to be based on Tolkiens vampires. They are fearsome bat-winged women with sharp talons. The males of the species are the Mervyl (singular, Morvul).
