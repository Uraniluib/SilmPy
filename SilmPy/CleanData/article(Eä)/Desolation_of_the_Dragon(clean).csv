File:Edward Beard, Jr. - Dragons Desolation.png
The Desolation of the Dragon (or the Desolation of Smaug) was the wasted, unpeopled lands around Lonely Mountain and Dale, charred and blackened by the burning breath of Smaug the Dragon., p. 208 The borders of the Desolation harboured a little clinging greenery and life, but its heart was scorched and utterly barren. The desolate lands extended southwards some miles along the banks of the River Running from Smaugs lair beneath the Lonely Mountain, but the lands to the north of the mountain seem to have suffered even more fiercely. After Smaugs death, it seems that the Desolation was slowly reclaimed, so that both Erebor and Dale were eventually to recover from their destruction and prosper once again.
