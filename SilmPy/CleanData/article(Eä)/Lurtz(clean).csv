Lurtz is a character created specifically for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He was played by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare. In video games, he is voiced by Isaac C. Singleton Jr.
==Role==
Lurtz was the first of Sarumans Uruk-hai to be bred, and led them into battle against the Fellowship of the Ring at Amon Hen.  Lurtz also appeared to be the largest Uruk-hai, and his strength is highlighted when he strangles an Orc immediately after being spawned. In the book, Boromir is slain by an unnamed orc or orcs; he is described as having been "pierced by many arrows". In the movie he is killed by Lurtz, who shoots him three times. Aragorn then intervenes, and after a brief fight stabs Lurtz and then removes his head. 
The character of Lurtz is one of the playable heroes of the Isengard Faction in EAs The Battle for Middle-earth Anthology.
==Etymology==
The name "Lurtz" may have been derived by Peter Jackson and his co-writers from the style of Tolkiens Orkish language, specifically the name Barad-d√ªr.
Lurtzs name is never spoken aloud in the film, and is only known from the franchise and credits.
