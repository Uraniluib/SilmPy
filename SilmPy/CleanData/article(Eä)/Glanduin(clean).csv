The Glanduin was a river of Eriador and a northern arm of the Gwathló.
==Course==
Beginning in the Misty Mountains south of Moria, it flowed west-north-west until it was met by the Sirannon near the old location of Ost-in-Edhil, the capital of the Noldor of Eregion. From there the Glanduin flowed westward towards the Mitheithel, which it met in the Swanfleet marshes (Nîn-in-Eilph) north-east of Tharbad. There was an old ford across the Glanduin east of the falls that dropped down into the marshy lowlands.
Beyond their joining both rivers became the Gwathló.
==History==
In the Second Age the Glanduin formed the southern boundary of Eregion. In the Third Age it was part of the southern boundary of Arnor.
The old ford was used by Frodo Baggins and the other travellers journeying north after the War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
Glanduin is Sindarin, and means "Border-river".
==Note==
The name "Glanduin" applied to the whole river during the time of Eregion and Arnor. However, by the time of the War of the Ring, it only applied to the swift upper course of the river, and usually it was referred to as the Swanfleet river (not River), simply meaning the river that flowed into the Swanfleet.
In an annotation to Pauline Baynes, J.R.R. Tolkien clarified that R. Glanduin should be placed near mountains, and that the name should refer to the upper part; the lower part should be named Swanfleet.
