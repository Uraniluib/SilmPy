hwesta is a noun meaning "breeze" in Quenya., Note, The names of the letters
Image:Hwesta.gifHwesta is also the name in Quenya of the twelfth letter of the Tengwar alphabet.  It is the fourth letter of the third grade or Tyellë, which contains "voiceless spirants" and it is the third letter in the fourth series of consonants.  For written Quenya or Sindarin, the fourth series is used for the labialized or kw-series, the Quessetéma.
In Quenya, which does not need a distinct sign for chw, this letter represents HW.  In Sindarin, which does distinguish between chw and hw, Hwesta represents CHW while Hwesta Sindarinwa (the thirty-fourth letter) represents HW.  In Westron the fourth series is used for the k-series, the Calmatéma, and this letter represents spirant CH as in Scottish "loch".  The Westron name for this letter is AhaSee Westron Tengwar (not to be confused with the name in Quenya of Aha).
