The house of Tulkas was the dwelling of Tulkas in Valmar, the city of the Valar in Valinor.The notion of Tulkas having a house in Valmar only appears in the earliest version of the legendarium, where J.R.R. Tolkien often included more elaborate descriptions of the Valar than in his manuscripts of later years.
The house is said to have sprung "high into the air with many storeys", and to sport a "tower of bronze and pillars of copper in a wide arcade". Tulkass house also had a court, where champions engaged in athletic games. There would often Nessa, wife of Tulkas, appear to bring goblets of wine and drinks to the players., p. 75
