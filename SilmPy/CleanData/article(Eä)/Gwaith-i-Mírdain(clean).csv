The Gwaith-i-Mírdain, the People of the Jewel-smiths, was a brotherhood of Elves master craftsmen of the Second Age who created the Rings of Power.
==History==
The Gwaith were founded by Celebrimbor and other Noldor of Lindon who settled in Eregion, close to the Dwarves of Moria and their mithril mines. Their capital was Ost-in-Edhil ().
Noldor and Dwarves cooperated for about a thousand years, and their rare friendship was the closest between Elves and Dwarves in history. Celebrimbor helped to construct the famous and magical Doors of Durin. The Gwaith were said to be the most talented artisans to have worked since the time of Fëanor himself (who was Celebrimbors grandfather). 
Sauron, after failing with Gil-galad and Elrond, targeted the Gwaith. In the guise of Annatar the "Lord of Gifts" in  he presented himself as an agent of the Valar and taught them how to forge the Rings of Power. The Gwaith were easily tempted since they wanted to bring to Middle-earth the joys of Valinor. The Rings would prevent or slow the decay of the mortal world, preserve what was desired or loved and also enhance the natural powers of a possessor even if that would mean disrupting the natural course of the mortal world.
The Gwaith together with "Annatar" made several rings in . Because of their friendship with the Dwarves, Celebrimbor presented King Durin III with Ring of Thrór. When Annatar had left (actually for Mordor) about  Celebrimbor made the Three Rings partly using the teachings of "Annatar".
Then Sauron betrayed them and forged the One Ring. However, the Gwaith realized his plan and denied to hand him their Rings, resulting in the War of the Elves and Sauron. Eregion was devastated in  and the survivors of the Gwaith followed Elrond and retreated to Rivendell.
