Quellë was the Quenya name for the season of "fading", or late autumn, also called Lasse-lanta or "leaf-fall". In Sindarin, this season was called Firith; or Narbeleth, which meant "sun-waning". In the Reckoning of Rivendell it was the fourth of the six "seasons", and corresponded more or less to the 54 days between 7 October and 30 November in the Shire Calendar.
