Werewolves were servants of Morgoth, bred in the Elder Days from Wolves and inhabited by dreadful spirits (fallen lesser Maiar or fÃ«ar of Orcs).
==History==
Werewolves were created (or a least corrupted from some other form) by Sauron, who was their master, and who took the shape of a great Wolves himself at least once.
The first werewolf was Draugluin, and the greatest was Carcharoth, the guardian of Angband, a descendant of Draugluin as all other werewolves were.
In the The Grey Annals it is told that "creatures that walked in wolf-shapes" entered Beleriand in the Valian Years 1330., p. 12
Although not appearing as such in the known written records of Arda during the Second Age and Third Age Ages, Gandalf mentioned the werewolves as being among Saurons servants in the late Third Age, along with orcs, trolls, wargs, and wraiths.
