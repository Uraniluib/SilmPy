Grond was a battering ram, used by Saurons forces to destroy the Great Gate of Minas Tirith of Minas Tirith during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The ram was "a hundred feet in length", and its head was of black steel, made to resemble a wolf. It is told that Grond had been induced with "magic". During the Siege of Gondor, Grond was drawn to the Great Gate by "great beasts" and was wielded by mountain-trolls.

:The ram took the shape of the whole wolfs body, rather of just its head. Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul) called it in after a smaller battering ram proved futile against the great gates.
2015: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Grond was encountered in the Epic Quest "The Strength of Sauron Book 3: Chapter 8: Gothmog Appears". The player managed to slightly damage the great ram, delaying its use in the coming battle. Gothmogs arrival forced the player to withdraw before further damage could be done.
