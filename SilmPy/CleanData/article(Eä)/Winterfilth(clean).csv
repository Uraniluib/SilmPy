Winterfilth was the tenth month of the Shire Calendar, approximately corresponding to modern 22 September through 21 October. 
This month was called Wintring in Bree. It was a jest in Bree to speak of "Winterfilth in the (muddy) Shire"
==Etymology==
The name referred to the completion of the year ("filling") before Winter in their old calendar (before they adopted the Kings Reckoning) when their new year began after harvest.
The name actually represents a Hobbitish of the Old English name for October, wiktionary:winterfylle√æ, meaning "Winter-filling" or "Winter-full moon".
