The Goblin Scribe is miniature Orcs#Orcs and Goblins played by Kiran Shah (via motion-capture) who worked as a scribe and a messenger for the Great Goblin in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. He records events in Goblin-town. He is a tiny goblin with malformed legs, and uses his long fingernail to write with on parchment. Because he cannot walk, he gets around on a pulley with a seat attached to it.
The Goblin King gives him orders to send a message to Azog that they have captured Thorin.
==Behind the scenes==
According to members of the film crew, the Goblin Scribe is the offspring of the Great Goblin, but he isnt given any proper recognition because of his diminutive stature.
