Sunday (archaic form Sunnendei) was the second day of the week in the Shire Calendar. It was dedicated to the Sun, representing the Númenórean day Oranor.
After the reform of Isengrim Took II, 1 January and 1 July always fell on Sunday.
==Etymology==
Sunday represents an archaic Hobbitish form "Sunnendei", a word preserved in the Yellowskin. It is dedicated to the Sun.
Sunday is translated as "Sunday" in The Lord of the Rings but it was not the chief day of the Hobbitish week, that being Friday. For this reason there was one exception, and the "Sunday" referred in the poem The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late, actually refers to the Hobbitish Highday.
