Dimrost, also known as Nen Girith, was a cascading waterfall on the stream of Celebros, where it flowed down to meet the River Taeglin on the borders of Brethil. The falls raised a fine spray into the air, from which they took their name, which means "Rainy Stair".  Above Dimrost, the Men of Brethil had constructed a wooden bridge to cross the Celebros. 
From the bridge, a wide view could be seen, showing the Ravines of Taeglin two miles distant., Nienor in Brethil
==History==
When Nienor was first brought to Brethil, when she saw that view from the bridge, she started shivering uncontrollably - so much so that the name of Dimrost was changed to Nen Girith, the "Shuddering Water". It was only later that the cause of her fear was discovered: the Ravines she had seen from the bridge would be the place of her tragic death.
==Etymology==
Nen Girith is Sindarin from dim "stair" and rost "rain".
