The Kings Company, also known as the Kings Riders, was the first Éored of the Riders of Rohan, who rode to battle beside the King himself. At the end of the Third Age, they were led by Déorwine, who with six others of the Company fell with the Théoden in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  Later, when Éomer came to Minas Tirith to lead the funeral procession of King Théoden back to Rohan, he brought the Kings Company with him.

2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:The Kings Company appear to be the inspiration for the Royal Guard of Edoras. They, unlike other soldiers in Rohan, have a consistent uniform with a long leaf-mail hauberk, a rich green cloak and a helm with a horse-hair crest. Gamling, Háma and Grimbold all wear this same uniform to emphasize their rank. The Royal Guard notably bear the body of Théodred from the Golden Hall during his funeral.
