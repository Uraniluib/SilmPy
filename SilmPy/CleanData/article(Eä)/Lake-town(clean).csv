Lake-town, also known as Esgaroth upon the Long Lake, was the township of the Lake-men in  Rhovanion. 
==Description==
The town was constructed entirely of wood and stood upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the Long Lake, as a protection against the dragon Smaug, who dwelt nearby in the Lonely Mountain.
It was situated on the west side of the lake, north of the mouth of the Forest River in a calm bay that was formed by the shelter of a rock promontory. A long wooden bridge connected the town to the land, ending in a building, with guards watching over the entrance.

In the middle of Lake-town the central market-place was located, which was a round pool connected to the lake by a tunnel. The greatest houses of Lake-town were around this market-place, from which ramps descended to the water. The edge of the town was occupied with quays and, again, ramps, which descended to the water.The tunnel, the bridge and the ramps are visible in Tolkiens drawing.
==History==
It is not known when Lake-town was built. The name Esgaroth is mentioned on Thrórs Map, and is said to be an older name, known while Smaug was younger. When Bilbo Baggins came to the town, he noticed old pilings of a (possibly older) greater town along the shores when the waters sank in a drought. Its possible that an original Esgaroth was destroyed sometime in the past, and the later Lake-town was its remnant.Karen Wynn Fonstad The Atlas of Middle-earth, The Hobbit - Lake-town
The Lake-town was occupied by the Lake-men, descendants of the survivors of the former Kingdom of Dale, like Bard, whose ancestor was its last lord, Girion. However as the years passed, Smaug was forgotten and children even doubted about his existence or the tales of older men who sometimes had seen him flying.

In the autumn of  Thorin and Company escaped from Thranduils halls and Thorin followed by Fíli, Kíli and Bilbo decided to enter the town and speak to the Master of Lake-town. The Dwarves were welcomed warmly, because the Lake-men were eager to have the King under the Mountain return. The Dwarves and Bilbo were hosted, rested and pampered before being sent with boats to the ruins of Dale to confront the dragon.

Some days later however, the town was attacked by Smaug, but Bard, who had indirectly learned of a weakness in Smaugs armour, slew the dragon with the Black Arrow. The town was wrecked by the dragon who fell dead on it and sunk in the lake. Survivors managed to sail to the lakeshore with boats and camped there. 
Thorin refused to share Smaugs treasure and declared war on both the Lake-men and the Elves. The conflict eventually exploded because they heard news of approaching Wargs and Orcs. Thus began the Battle of Five Armies. 
The town was afterwards rebuilt to the north of its former location, using some of the treasure. The towns Master ran off with some of the gold. Part of the towns population followed Bard to resettle the Kingdom of Dale.
By the time of the War of the Ring, Lake-town was part of the kingdom of Dale under Bard II.
==Etymology==
The name Esgaroth was seemingly not given a clear etymology in any of J.R.R. Tolkiens later writings. A manuscript written after The Lord of the Rings states that Esgaroth was "not Sindarin (though perhaps Sindarized in shape)", similarly to the name Galion#Etymoloy., p. 54
In earlier manuscripts, at least two interpretations of the name Esgaroth appeared:
#Deriving from the root-word esgar, meaning "reed-bed" in Ilkorin. The whole name Esgaroth translates as "…Reedlake, because of reed-banks in west"., p. 356 (entry ESEK)
#Translated as "?Uncommon words#S-Uncommon words#cite_ref-LT2_0-0", from esgar "shore" (not given any designated language)., p. 14
