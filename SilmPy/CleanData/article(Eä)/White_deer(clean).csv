White deer were a type of Deer found in the forest of Mirkwood. Along with two fawns, such a hind surprised Bilbo Baggins and the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor when they first entered Mirkwood forest.
==Other writings==
An encounter with a white doe occurs in "The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun", preceding Autrous meeting with a witch.
==Inspiration==
Magical animals of white colour were common in Celtic and Welsh mythology. The legends of King Arthur include a story about the pursuit of a large, white deer, leading to the arrival at the magical Sir Pellinores well.Lars Nood√©n, "http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lars/rel375.html Animal Symbolism in Celtic Mythology" (paper for Religion 375 at the University of Michigan, 22 November 1992; accessed 12 March 2011)
Douglas A. Anderson has noted that the appearance of white deer in The Hobbit forebodes the approach by Bilbo and company to the Elves of Mirkwood area of Mirkwood, as "in Celtic tradition, encounters with white animals (especially white deer) usually prefigure an encounter with beings from the Otherworld (Fairies)"., pp. 200-1
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
: The White Hart is the largest breed of deer found in northwestern Middle-earth (rumoured to have Fairies blood). The suggested Sindarin name of this type of deer was Nimfiara in the early publications from MERP, later revised to Nimmerais (sing. Nimmaras). (linguistic contributions by David Salo and Arden R. Smith)
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
: The Extended Edition includes a scene in which a white deer appears as the dwarves try to cross the river in Mirkwood. Thorin Oakenshield tries to shoot it down with an arrow but he misses. The deer later flees.
