The Land of the Sun, also known as the Burnt Land of the Sun, Easterness, Eastland, and Eastern Land, was a continent in the far east of Arda that corresponded symmetrically to Aman in the far west. The land was separated from Middle-earth by the waters of the East Sea.
In the Land of the Sun was a great, curve-shaped mountain range called the Walls of the Sun, which corresponded symmetrically to the Pelóri of Aman. The Walls of the Sun were great, but not as tall as the Pelóri.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales Part One, the easternmost land of Arda was called Oronto ("East"). This region was connected to the Middle-earth, laying directly east of Palisor, with no separating water. The huge peak Kalormë stood in Oronto.
Oromë described the East to the Valar, saying that "there is a silent beach and dark empty seas". It is also told that Aulë and Ulmo "builded great havens of the Sun and Moon beside the soundless sea".
