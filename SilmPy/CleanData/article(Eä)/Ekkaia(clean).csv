Ekkaia (also called the Encircling Sea, the Outer Sea, or the Outer Ocean) was the mighty sea that surrounded all the lands of Arda, Middle-earth and Aman alike. Its dark waters lapped the western shores of Valinor, and at its distant unknown edge stood the Walls of Night. Ulmos halls were within the Outer Sea.
During their time in Valinor Fëanor and his sons visited the shores of these waters. The Helcaraxë was the narrow strait between the Outer Sea and Belegaer, where in the chilled waters clashed hills of ice amidst vast fogs of deathly cold.
==Etymology==
The name Ekkaia, commonly understood to be Quenya, was not explained by J.R.R. Tolkien.
Helge Fauskanger has tried to explain Ekkaia by deriving it from the unattested form et-gaya ("out-sea"; cf. et "out").Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 27 October 2011)
Robert Ireland links Ekkaia to the Sundocarme KHAYA ("far, distant"), which appears to include among its derivatives an adverb similar in form: ekkaira ("far off, far away").Robert Ireland, http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/SILM/SILM_CE.html The Silmarillion Dictionary (C-E) at http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/Tolkien_Dictionary.html A Tolkien Dictionary (accessed 27 October 2011), p. 364 (entry KHAYA-)
