Taniquetil or Oiolossë, the great Holy Mountain, was the highest of the mountains of Pelóri and the tallest peak in Arda. On its summit was raised Ilmarin, the mansions of Manwë and Varda.
According to The Annals of Aman, it was raised 3,450 Valian Years (or 33,000 solar years) after the Valar arrived in Aman.
