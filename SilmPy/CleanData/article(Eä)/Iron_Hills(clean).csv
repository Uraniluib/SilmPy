The Iron Hills were a range of great hills in the north-east of Rhovanion. The Hills were the source of the river Carnen and rich in iron. It was also home to a Dwarf realms of the Durins Folk.
The Iron Hills were rich in iron,, p. 302 but probably not in gold; the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, although prosperous, were not as wealthy as their other cousins.
==History==
===Early history===
The Durins Folk Dwarves of Moria colonized the Iron Hills in the First Age.The existence of the Iron Hills in the First Age is confirmed by Tolkiens writings published in The Peoples of Middle-earth. Before these writings were published, other authors speculated that the Iron Hills might have been a part of the Iron Mountains in the First Age and came into independent existence after the War of Wrath. See Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth p. 78 and Charles Noad, "A Note on the Geography of the First Age" in Amon Hen 38, p. 12. The Hills were their primary source of iron-ore. The Old Forest Road ran north-east to the Hills for the dwarf-traders and merchants between Khazad-dûm and the Hills., p. 323 (note 30)
Also in the First Age, some Men who migrated out of the east—"laggard kindred" of the Edain—chose to settle in the lands between the Iron Hills and Mirkwood., p. 306
After Sauron destroyed Eregion in the Second Age, the Longbeards sealed Khazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the Grey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and Khazad-dûm for some time., p. 306
===Third Age===
In  the last of the Dwarves living in Khazad-dûm fled from the Balrogs who had slain kings Durin VI and Náin I. Some of those who escaped wandered as far as the Iron Hills and resettled there.
In  dragons began War of the Dwarves and Dragons and in  King Dáin I was slain by a Cold-drakes outside Dáins halls in the Grey Mountains. Due to these depredations, in  Grór son of Dáin left the Grey Mountains and established a Lordship in the Iron Hills.
Over the next few centuries Grór and his people built the hills from a just an ancient mining colony to a great realm, especially after the Sack of Erebor of Lonely Mountain in  when the Dragon Smaug scattered the Longbeards who dwelt there. Most of the survivors subsequently went to their kinsmen in the Iron Hills, swelling its numbers.
Before the death of Smaug in , the dwarven realm in the Iron Hills was the only force in the north-east of Rhovanion capable of offering a large and strong enough resistance to the forces of evil.
In  the final battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs Battle of Azanulbizar. When reinforcements, led by Náin (son of Grór), arrived from the Iron Hills the battle turned in the favour of the dwarves. With the war over, Dáin led his people home where, after the death of Grór, he became the new Lord of the Iron Hills.
In  Lord Dáin Ironfoot led his warriors in the Battle of Five Armies near Erebor. The battle was won, but Thorin was slain and Dáin became the new King under the Mountain and Kings of Durins Folk as Dáin II. He relocated to Erebor with many of his people, and re-established it as Durins folks greatest and strongest dwelling in the north. The Iron Hills pass out of history after this relocation, but probably were not wholly deserted.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 212
