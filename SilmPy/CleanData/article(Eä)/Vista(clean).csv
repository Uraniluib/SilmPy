Vista (Quenya, pron. ) or Wista (pron. ) was a part of the atmosphere that surrounded the world of Arda before the cataclysm at the end of the Second Age.
Vista was the lowest layer of the atmosphere, filled with normal breathable air: above it was Ilmen, and above that Vaiya.  Vista was divided into two parts: The upper part was Fanyamar, the home of clouds, and the lower part was Aiwenórë, the "land" of birds.  Vista only lay upon Middle-earth and the seas; it was bounded by the Pelóri in the West, the Gates of Morning in the East, and the Walls of the World in the North and South.
The air in Valinor is that of Ilmen which can only sustain the servants of Manwë or those to whom he has granted this ability.  Thus the mortal creatures of Middle-earth were bound within the confines of Vista while they lived., pp. 289-290
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the early schematic titled I Vene Kemen, the lowest layer of airs was marked as Vilna (Qenya).
