He was a king of Easterlings during the Second Age, and he was one of the nine Men to whom Sauron gave Nine Rings. Like the others, he became a powerful sorcerer and ruler until eventually faded into a Wraiths and his will was surrendered to Sauron. By  he was already one of Saurons servants.
It was said that, after the Witch-king, Khamûl was most ready to perceive the presence of the One Ring, but his power was most confused and diminished by daylight.  
In  Sauron returned to Mordor and declared openly to his enemies. Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths were sent to the fortress of Dol Guldur and Khamûl took command. 
During the War of the Ring he was one of the Ringwraiths who entered the Shire, and asked Gaffer Gamgee for "Baggins". However it was the day after Frodo Baggins had left Hobbiton, and he then pursued the Hobbits to Bucklebury Ferry in the Shire some days later.
Following the destruction of the One Ring, Khamûl perished with the rest of the Ringwraiths.
