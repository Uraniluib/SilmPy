Minyar (Quenya), was the original name of the first Clan of the Elves, before the Great Journey. The Clan-name, meaning Firsts was derived from the name of the father of the Clan, Imin One, the first Elf-fathers to awake at Cuiviénen. 
The other original clans in Cuiviénen were the Tatyar Seconds, and the Nelyar Thirds according to the Elf-fathers Tata Two and Enel Three. The Minyar were 14 in number out of the total 144 Elves who awoke at Cuiviénen. They all followed Ingwë in the March and became the Vanyar. None remained behind., pp. 380-1
