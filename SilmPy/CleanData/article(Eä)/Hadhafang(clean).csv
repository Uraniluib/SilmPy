Hadhafang is a sword used by Elrond and Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The sword and its history are not part of the original story, but were invented for the movies. 
==History==
According to the movies official publicity material, Hadhafang once belonged to the Elves Idril, who wed Tuor, a Men, and bore Eärendil, the father of Elrond. 
Elrond wielded Hadhafang at the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance.
Later, his daughter Arwen carried Hadhafang when she aided Frodo Baggins in his escape from the Nazgûl. Inscribed on the blade are tengwar in (Neo-Elvish)Sindarin that say:

Aen estar Hadhafang i chathol hen, thand arod dan i thang an i arwen
("This blade is called Hadhafang, a noble defense against the enemy throng for a noble maiden")

According to a Decipher Card, Arwens sword is called Gwemegil (perhaps gwen+megil "maiden-sword"), and was forged in Rivendell.The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, http://lotrtcgdb.com/pages/LOTR01047.html Gwemegil (1R47)
==Etymology==
Hadhafang (or Haðafang) is mentioned as a Noldorin "sword-name" in The Etymologies, mentioned in the entries SYAD and STAG. Another dissimilated form given is Havathang. It is said to be a cognate of Quenya Sangahyando, "throng-cleaver". 
The names have not been used by Tolkien in his stories, while Sangahyando was eventually used as a persons name, of a Corsairs.
