The Dagor Aglareb, the "Glorious Battle", was the third battle of the Battles of Beleriand.
==History==
===Prelude===
After the Dagor-nuin-Giliath the Noldor of Beleriand had wasted their chance to destroy Morgoths forces quickly, and instead had been building their numerous realms and establishing contacts with the Sindar.
===Battle===
As the Ered Engrin spewed forth fire, Morgoth sent forth numerous small bands of Orcs, which passed through the Pass of Sirion in the west and Maglors Gap in the east. Fighting small battles along the way, they penetrated deep in West and East Beleriand, where they were destroyed by southern forces of the Noldor and Elves under Círdan of the Falas.  In the east, Maedhros, Maglor and their brothers hunted down other roving bands of Orcs as they penetrated Maglors Gap and operated in Ossiriand.
Thingol refused to march besides the sons of Fëanor, and thus no help came from Doriath. The Laiquendi of Ossiriand fought no more battles after their leader had been killed in the First Battle of Beleriand, and they also played no part in the current struggle.
Meanwhile, the main force of the Orcs spewed forth from Angband across the plains to the highlands of Dorthonion, where the brothers Angrod and Aegnor held them off. Soon armies under Fingolfin and Maedhros counter-attacked on the plains of Lothlann and Ard-galen, from both east and west. The Orc armies were caught between the hammer and anvil of the two elven forces, with most of the Orcs being destroyed, and the remnant retreating towards Angband. The Noldor pursued them, and utterly destroyed what remained of their enemies within sight of the peaks of Thangorodrim.
=== Aftermath===
This was the first complete victory over Morgoth, and after it the Noldor maintained a close guard on Angband, beginning the period of watchful peace known as the Siege of Angband.  This siege lasted some 400 years, but it could never be a complete investment because of the impassable Iron Mountains on the northern flank of Morgoths fortress.
