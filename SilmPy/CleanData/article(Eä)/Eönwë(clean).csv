Eönwë (Quenya, pron. ) was the banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and Chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. Eönwë was the best with weapons in all Arda, though not necessarily the most powerful.
When Eärendil reached the shores of Aman, it was Eönwë who first greeted him and summoned him to come before the Powers of Arda.  When Manwë decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to Middle-earth to fight the War of Wrath, leading the Vanyar.
When Morgoth was defeated Eönwë played a key role in the aftermath. He took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping, but when the two remaining Sons of Fëanor stole them and fled, Eönwë did not allow them to be slain. Sauron paid obeisance to Eönwë and abjured all of his evil deeds.  But because Eönwë had not the power to pardon Sauron, he commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwës judgement.  Unwilling to receive humiliation and sentencing, when Eönwë left Sauron hid in Middle-earth and fell back into evil.
At the dawn of the Second Age, Eönwë came among the three faithful houses of Edain and taught them many things, blessing them with wisdom and power and longer mortality. These became the High Men of Númenor.  
==Etymology==
The name Eönwë is Quenya in form, entry Eonwe however the ancient Loremasters knew no Elvish etymology of the name, suggesting that it is probably of Valarin origin.; note that the original text discusses the characters earlier name, "Fionwe", which Christopher Tolkien considers a mistake.
See also the Quenya ending -wë.
===Earlier names===
In earlier works, such as The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation), his name is Fiönwë which translates to "Son", from Qenya fion. This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë. 
His other early name, Urion, means "He of the Sun", from ur ("the Sun"), uru ("fire") or urin ("blazing"), and the masculine suffix -ion.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë was envisioned as the son of Manwë, but as the concept of the Valarindi (Children of the Valar) was abandoned, he was turned into Manwës herald instead. , p.58 In some versions Eönwë is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for Arien (previously named Urwendi), instead of Turin., p. 219
