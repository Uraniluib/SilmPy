Aerandir was one of the three mariners (together with Erellont and Falathar) to accompany EÃ¤rendil on his voyage to Aman.J.R.R. Tolkien never specified the race of the three mariners, thus only speculation can be made whether they were Men (cf. http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/aerandir.html Encyclopedia of Arda) or Elves (cf. http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=347256&page=73 this game forum thread)
==Etymology==
Aerandir is Sindarin, meaning "Sea-wanderer" (aer + randir).
The name for the character appearing in an early manuscript was Airandir,, p. 324 a form later rejected by Tolkien., p. 246
