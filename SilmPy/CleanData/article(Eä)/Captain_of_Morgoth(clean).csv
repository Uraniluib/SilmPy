The Captain of Morgoth in the west during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad or Battle of Unnumbered Tears was the leader of the host from Morgoth that assailed Fingon at Eithel Sirion.
He most probably perished in the charge of Elves initiated by Gwindor and joined by the host of Fingon. This charge "swept away and destroyed" the evil host and passed on to Angband.
The Captain had been commanded by Morgoth to ensure Fingons force was brought to battle as early as possible so they could not have the opportunity to outflank Morgoths main army.
It is not known whether the Captain of Morgoth was an Orcs, Troll, Balrogs, or some other beast.
