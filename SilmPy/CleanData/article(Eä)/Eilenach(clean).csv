Eilenach was the second of the seven beacon-hills of Gondor, after Amon Dîn in the east, and it was the highest point of the Drúadan Forest. It had a sharp summit, incapable of sustaining a large fire. Its main purpose was to relay the fire of Amon Dîn to Nardol.
On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
==Etymology==
On the origin of the name, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote Eilenach is "probably an alien name, not Sindarin, not Númenor, or Westron.", p. 19, p. 510 Perhaps it was pre-Númenórean.
