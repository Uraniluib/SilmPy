MEN is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "go",, p. 32 (root appearing as "√men") or "move, proceed (in a direction intended by a person)",, p. 6 (root appearing as "√men") or "have as object, (in)tend, proceed, make for, go towards, go"., p. 165 (root appearing as "√MEN" and "√MEN-"
In his notes on a poem in The Road Goes Ever On (book), J.R.R. Tolkien gave the form men ("direction, region"). It was from this men + el which was invented the Quenya word Menel., p. 72 It is not known with certainty if men here refers to a Primitive Quendian word (cf. Men (Elvish)#Elvish) or to a root.
