The Petty-dwarves were a diminutive race of Dwarves. 
Petty-dwarves differed from normal Dwarves in various ways: they were smaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names: other Dwarves kept their Khuzdul names and language a secret. This may have been one of the reasons they were exiled.
==History==
The Petty-dwarves were Dwarves of presumably several :Category: Dwarven clans, which had been exiled from eastern Dwarf cities for unclear reasons. They were the first to cross the Ered Luin in the First Age, and established strongholds in Beleriand before the Elves arrived, at Nulukkizdîn and Sharbhund (also known as Bar-en-Nibin-noeg, the "House of the Petty Dwarves"). In Beleriand they diminished in physical stature and in smith-craft.

The Sindar, not acquainted with Dwarves yet, thought the Petty-dwarves were animals, and hunted them. Not until the Dwarves of Belegost and Nogrod established contact with the Sindar did they realize what the "animals" were and named them Noegyth Nibin; Petty-dwarves. 
Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but they had already dwindled and hated all Elves with a passion; especially the Noldor whom they saw as usurpers who took their lands (Nargothrond was built in Nulukkizdîn). In the time of the Wars of Beleriand the Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. The last remnant of their people were Mîm and his two sons Ibun and Khîm, who lived at Amon Rûdh.
==Names==
A name among the Eldar for the Petty-dwarves was Levain tad-tal (biped animals), or simply Tad-dail., p. 388 Another name, used among the Sindar, was Noegyth Nibin or Nibin-Noeg or Nibin-Nogrim.
