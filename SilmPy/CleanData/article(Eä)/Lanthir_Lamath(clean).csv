Lanthir Lamath, the "Waterfall of Echoing Voices" was the shimmering, glittering waterfall that ran beside the house of Dior in Ossiriand, probably part of the stream of the River Adurant. Lanthir Lamath was most famous for inspiring the name of Diors daughter Elwing, whose name - meaning Star-spray - was inspired by the falling water on the night of stars when she was born.
