Barad Nimras (Sindarin Tower of the White Horn) was a tower on a headland westward of Eglarest built by Finrod. Its purpose was to watch the western seas, and warn of any naval attack by Morgoths forces. As Morgoth never mounted any attack from the ocean, the tower was never in fact needed.
In the year after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, though, Morgoth did launch Fall of the Falas on Eglarest and Brithombar, and Barad Nimras was torn down at that time by the very foes it was meant to guard against.
==Etymology==
Barad Nimras is a Sindarin name from barad "tower", nimp "white" and ras "horn". It may be a reference to the tower itself, or perhaps to the narrow cape on which it stood.
