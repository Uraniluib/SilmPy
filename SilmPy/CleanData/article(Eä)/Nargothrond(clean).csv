==History==
===Creation===
On the western bank of the river Narog, beneath the forested hills of Taur-en-Faroth, the Caverns of Narog were first known as Nulukkizdîn, secretly inhabited by the Petty-dwarves before they were driven out. What became of the Petty-Dwarves at this time is not recorded, but at least some escaped to dwell in Amon Rûdh.

After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, King Thingol described the Caverns to his kinsman Finrod. Inspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which to be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod chose those caves to build his great underground fortress, and established Nargothrond. He was aided by the Dwarves of the Ered Luin, who also made for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves and gave him his famous epithet, Felagund, Hewer of Caves. Finrod rewarded them with treasures he brought from Tirion.
Finrod also raised an artificial hill, Amon Ethir, a league far from the gates of Nargothrond.
===Days of Power===
Finrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his quest for the Silmarils and handed rule to Orodreth.  However, since the Dagor Bragollach Celegorm and Curufin, the sons of Fëanor, were defeated and retreated to Nargothrond where they were received as one of them.  Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher.  Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at the time Finrod departed with Beren and were more powerful than Orodreth until Finrods death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

(Main article: Fall of Nargothrond)
Túrin later came to Nargothrond and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Morgoth (the bridge was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the dragon Glaurung.
===Afterwards===
Glaurung stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to Brethil to assail Túrin and was killed by him at Cabed-en-Aras.  Then, Mîm the Petty-dwarf settled there reclaiming his peoples ancient home until he was killed by Húrin. Húrin entered the dark caves where the treasures Finrod brought from Valinor still lay there, but he brought out the Nauglamir. 
The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Age until the War of Wrath when it went down with the rest of Beleriand.
==Etymology==
From its first conception, the name Nargothrond means "Underground fortress on the river Narog". Its Petty-dwarves name was Nulukkizdîn (erronously spelled Nulukkizdîn in the published works).
However, in his later life, J.R.R. Tolkien devised the Dwarvish name Nar(u)kathan instead, to which the Elves suffixed -rond, "vaulted dome"., p. 47
In Eriols Old English translations, Nargothrond is referred as Hlydingaburg "City of the Hlydingas" or Stangaldor(burg).
