 
Anar was one of the four Dwarves that accompanied Bilbo Baggins on his journeys after his birthday party.
==Other versions==
In the early writings of the chapter "A Long-expected Party", Anar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, J.R.R. Tolkien later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.
