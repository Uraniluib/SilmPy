Muzgash was an Orcs serving in the garrison of the Tower of Cirith Ungol, under the command of Shagrat. He was caught up in fighting with Gorbags Minas Morgul-orcs in the Tower; with Lagduf, he attempted to escape, but was shot as he ran through the gate.

: Though unidentified, a trio of Uruk-hai are encountered by Samwise Gamgee on the stairs of the tower after the battle. Since only one Uruk (Snaga (Orc of Mordor)) was encountered by Sam on the stairs in the novel, it is likely that the other two are meant to be Lagduf and Muzgash.
