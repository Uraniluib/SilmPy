Little Folk was a term for the Hobbits, especially the Bree-hobbits (q.v.), contrasting them to the Men of Bree (the Big Folk) as the two races live together in Bree-land.  
At other points, Boromir and Celeborn referred to the Hobbits of the Fellowship of the Ring as "little folk". Treebeard and Sharkeys Ruffians also referred to the Halflings in general as such, and thus it may be assumed that the term was in common use.
