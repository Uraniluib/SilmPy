Gwaihir was the greatest and the swiftest of the Eagles of Middle-earth at the time of the War of the Ring. 
==History==
A descendant of Thorondor, it is said that Gwaihir was his vassal in the First Age and, with his brother Landroval, helped rescue Beren and Lúthien from Angband. p. 68 In the Third Age he was the greatest and the swiftest of the Eagles of the North.
During the War of the Ring, Radagast sought help of his old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: wolves and Orcs gathering and mustering, the movements of the Nazgûl, and the escape of Gollum from Mirkwood.

As instructed by Gandalf, Radagast sent Gwaihir to bear the news to him at Isengard, but Gandalf was at that time imprisoned at the pinnacle of Orthanc. On an autumn night, Gandalf saw the Eagle flying towards him and so Gwaihir rescued the Wizard. But Gwaihir couldnt carry him far, so Gwaihir left him at Edoras in order to find a steed. 
Later he was sent by Galadriel to find Gandalf; he found him on the peak of Celebdil after the Battle of the Peak, and carried him to Lothlórien.
Gwaihir, Meneldor and Landroval helped the Free peoples in the Battle of the Morannon; in the aftermath, they brought Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee out of Mordor after the One Ring was destroyed.
==Genealogy==




==Etymology==
Gwaihir comes from Sindarin gwaew ("wind"), pp. 33-4 and possibly hîr "lord".  His name could thus likely be translated as "Windlord".
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Eagles named "Gwaihir" and "Landroval" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in early The Silmarillion, as vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear Beren and Lúthien from Angband. These references were removed by Christopher Tolkien to escape the seeming discrepancy with The Lord of the Rings, although later he admitted that he was not sure about his fathers intentions. Chs. 12–15, p. 301–3
It is generally thought that Gwaihir is the Lord of the Eagles of The Hobbit, although J.R.R. Tolkien never makes a connection nor mentions that Gwaihir was Lord of the Eagles. This notion is also seen in Robert Fosters The Complete Guide to Middle-earth.
In the whole Lord of the Rings Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says that Gwaihir had carried him twice; this implies that Gwaihir never carried him before the timeframe of the book.
