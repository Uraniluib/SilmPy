Sorontil is a mountain of Númenor (actually the only known besides Meneltarma) standing near the islands North Cape of Forostar, with its eastern flanks forming sheer sea-cliffs.
Tar-Meneldur built a tall tower in the vicinity of this mountain.
==Etymology==
Sorontil is not given a translation in the sources, but an apparent analysis would be soron + -til, thus meaning "Eagle peak". The translation would suggest that its craggy peaks were possibly populated by Eagles.
