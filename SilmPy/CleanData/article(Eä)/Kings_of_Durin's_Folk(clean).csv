The Kings of Durins Folk were those of the House of Durin who ruled as kings, even when in exile.  
The kings were all descended from Durin of the First Age; in fact, five of the kings after Durin I were held to be reincarnations of him by the Dwarves.  No complete list of all kings is known. The table below shows the names of those Kings who have been recorded, or whose existence could be deduced.  In the table all information was obtained from The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A, "Durin’s Folk" unless otherwise indicated.  The "Realm(s)" column indicates which place or places the kings ruled from during their reigns.

Durin the DeathlessBefore  Late First AgeMoriaOne of the seven Fathers of the Dwarves and founder of the Longbeards, Durins Folk. He ruled his people for centuries - so long, in fact, that he became known as the Durin the Deathless - but eventually he died during the First Age.  He discovered the caves of Khazad-dûm and began his reign there.
Durin IIUnknownUnknownKhazad-dûmLittle is recorded about his reign, although there are indications that the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm were in a confederation with Men of the Vales of Anduin, where the Men provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items.
Durin IIIUnknownUnknownKhazad-dûmHe was the king of Khazad-dûm at the time of the forging of the Rings of Power (sometime between  and ) and a great friend of Celebrimbor the Lord of Eregion to the west. He received one of the Rings (later known as the Ring of Thrór) as a gift from his friend.

Glóin (King of Durins Folk)Ered Mithrin He expanded the mines of the Ered Mithrin, and further abandoned Erebor.
Óin (King of Durins Folk)Ered MithrinTowards the very end of Óins reign, in T.A. 2460, the Shadow returned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood with increased strength; and in c. T.A. 2480 Orcs began to spread again in the Misty Mountains in order to block all passes into Eriador, whilst Saurons creatures took Moria as their own.
Náin IIEred MithrinIn , the prosperous Dwarves began to suffer attacks by the dragons of the north.
Dáin I †Ered MithrinHis short reign came to a swift end when he was slain by a Cold-drakes before the entrance to his Dáins halls. He was succeeded by his son.
Thrór †Ered Mithrin, Erebor, exile, DunlandHe led his people out of the dragon-infested north back to the Lonely Mountain. He had been King under the Mountain for more than 180 years when the dragon Smaug descended on the mountain and Sack of Erebor it. He escaped the destruction, and went wandering in the wild before settling in Dunland.  Later, went to reclaim Khazad-dûm where he was murdered by Azog the Orc, a crime that provoked the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.
Thráin †Dunland, Ered LuinHe avenged his fathers death with the defeat of Azogs Orcs at the Battle of Azanulbizar. In the early part of his reign, he dwelt in Dunland, but he later moved northwest to the Ered Luin west of Eriador and established a Thorins Halls. Before his reign ended, he resolved to return to Erebor, but while wandering in the wild he was captured in  and died in the dungeons of the Necromancer.
Thorin †Ered Luin, Erebor He ruled as King in the Ered Luin for many years, but like his father before him he determined to return to his ancient home of Erebor.  Accompanied by Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, he led a troop of companions into the east, and against all hope recovered the Lonely Mountain from Smaug.  After Smaugs death, Thorin was slain in the Battle of Five Armies. The only remaining descendants of Thrórs line, Thorins nephews Fíli and Kíli, were also lost in the battle.  So the Kingship passed to the line of Thrórs younger brother Grór, and specifically to his grandson Dáin Ironfoot.
Dáin Ironfoot †Erebor Dáin was a descendant of Grór and lord of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. Dáin joined his fathers contingent in the Battle of Azanulbizar, at which time he slew Azog. After Thorins death in the Battle of Five Armies, Dáin was proclaimed king of Durins Folk. He ruled in prosperity as King under the Mountain for many years until the time of the War of the Ring. He was slain in the Battle of Dale.
Thorin StonehelmEarly Fourth AgeEreborIn , Dáin succeeded as King under the Mountain and King of Durins Folk, and Thorin simultaneously became crown prince. Thorin himself succeeded to the kingships when his father was killed during the War of the Ring in T.A. 3019. Thorin III helped rebuild Erebor and Dale, and prospered. His realm became a close ally of the Reunited Kingdom of King Aragorn. During his rule, Gimli led a number of Dwarves south to Aglarond, where a new lordship was established, most likely a colony of Durins Folk under the vassalage of the King of Erebor.
Durin VIIUnknownUnknownKhazad-dûmWas the direct descendant of King Thorin III Stonehelm (according to some sources, his son),The Peoples of Middle-earth: "The Making of Appendix A", (iv) Durins Folk, p. 279. ruler of Erebor and the Iron Hills in the Fourth Age. His birth was apparently prophesied upon the accession of Dáin II after the Battle of Five ArmiesThe Peoples of Middle-earth: "The Making of Appendix A", (iv) Durins Folk, p. 383. (although no record exists of the actual prophecy itself). He led Durins Folk back to recolonize Khazad-dûm (Moria) at some (unspecified) time after the beginning of the Fourth Age, where they remained "until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durins race were ended".The Peoples of Middle-earth: "The Making of Appendix A", (iv) Durins Folk, p. 278.

Durin I died before the end of the First Age, so that between his rule and that of Thorin III, the Kings of Durins line ruled for a period of about 6,500 years. Given that the average length of a reign among the Longbeards seems to have been roughly a century, it can be deduced that there were probably about fifty Kings that have went unmentioned.
