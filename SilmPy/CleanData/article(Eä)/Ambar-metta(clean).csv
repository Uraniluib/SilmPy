Ambar-metta is the Quenya term that refers to the End of the World.
It is mostly known as was part of a line used by Elendil upon his arrival to Middle-earth, declaring "Out of the Belegaer to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the Arda". Aragorn would later use this line at his Coronation of Elessar.
