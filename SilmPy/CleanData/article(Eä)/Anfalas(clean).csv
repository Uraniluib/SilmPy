Anfalas, or Langstrand, was a coastal region of Gondor between the rivers Lefnui and Morthond, south of Pinnath Gelin.
==History==
In the Third Age the Gondorians had traditions that it was once inhabited by Elves.
During the War of the Ring, the people of the Anfalas were harassed at the coasts by the Corsairs of Umbar. Lord Golasgil led a long line of scantily equipped hunters and fishermen, and also his own household, to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
==Etymology==
