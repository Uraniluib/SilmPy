Bindbole Wood was a small wood in the southern part of the Northfarthing in the Shire.
==Name==
The name appears in the map of the Shire, but the letter o in the 1954 edition was not very clear; thus the name has been rendered Bindbale in many later maps (e.g. by Barbara Strachey and Karen Wynn Fonstad), and elsewhere, like in Robert Fosters The Complete Guide to Middle-earth (s.v. Bindbale).
Even Tolkien himself referred to Bindbale in a manuscript note when he was preparing the document later known as Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings., p. lvii
==Etymology==
The name presumably contains Wiktionary:bole#Etymology_1 "trunk of a tree".
