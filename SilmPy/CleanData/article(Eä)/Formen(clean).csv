formen is a noun meaning "north" in Quenya., Note, The names of the letters
 Image:Formen.gifFormen is also the name in Quenya of the tenth letter of the Tengwar alphabet.  It is the second letter of the third grade or Tyellë, which contains "voiceless spirants" and it is the third letter in the labial or p-series of consonants, the Parmatéma.  In all modes Formen represents F.  It was one of the most widely known and used of all the Tengwar since it indicated "north" even in languages that used a very different term.  The Westron name for this letter is Fí.See Westron Tengwar
==Etymology==
In the West-lands of Middle-earth the four cardinal directions were Númen, Hyarmen, Rómen, and Formen, and they were named in this order, beginning with (and facing) west.  Hyarmen meant a left-hand region and Formen meant a right-hand region.  Thus the word for "north" derives from the Primitive Quendian Sundocarme PHOR, meaning "right hand", plus MEN indicating direction., PHOR-
