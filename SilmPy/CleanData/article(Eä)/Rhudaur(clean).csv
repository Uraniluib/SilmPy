Rhudaur was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the break-up of Arnor (). The other kingdoms were Arthedain and Cardolan.
==Location==
Rhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and stretched from the Weather Hills with Weathertop to the river Bruinen. It reached to the Ettenmoors. It shared a long border with Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the line of the Weather Hills.
The land between the rivers Mitheithel and Bruinen, forming the Angle (Eriador), was also considered part of Rhudaur.
==History==
From the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two other successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with Cardolan over the tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantíri associated with the tower.
The first Stoors Hobbits came into Eriador around . However, due to the increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around , with some of them moving west to Arthedain, and others moving back to the Vales of Anduin.
The last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were descended of Hill-men; by the time of Argeleb I of Arnor, Rhudaur was ruled by an evil lord who secretly was in league with Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain. Argeleb died fighting Rhudaur and Angmar.
Angmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in . By this time the Númenóreans were gone from the region, as well as most of the other inhabitants.
There is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost the Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers of the North established several villages there, where their people lived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under Aragorn at the end of the Third Age.
==Etymology==
The name Rhudaur is translated by Tolkien as "Troll shaw" (rhû "evil, wicked" and taur, "forest")., pp. 115, 170 It is unknown whether it is intended to be the same as Trollshaws.
