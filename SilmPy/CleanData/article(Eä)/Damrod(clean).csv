Damrod was a Rangers of Ithilien.
==History==
Damrod was the companion of Mablung (ranger of Ithilien) and a trusted guard of Faramir.  Together he and Mablung watched Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee during the ambush of the Haradrim in Ithilien.  While they waited before the battle Damrod told the hobbits of the Enemys dealings with the Southrons.  Damrod had little hope; he believed "the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed".
After the ambush Damrod and Mablung continued to serve as watch-guards over the hobbits as the Rangers journeyed to Henneth Annûn.
