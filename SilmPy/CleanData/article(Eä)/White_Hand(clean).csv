The White Hand was an emblem of Saruman during the War of the Ring.  After Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took had been captured, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli came upon the Orcs slain by Boromir.  Four of the goblin-soldiers bore shields with a small white hand centered in a field of black - these were warriors of Isengard.
On the road to Isengard there was a tall black pillar upon which was a great stone carved in the likeness of a long white hand with a finger pointing north.
