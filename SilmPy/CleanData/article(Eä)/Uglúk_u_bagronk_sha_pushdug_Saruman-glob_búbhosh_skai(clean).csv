Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búb-hosh skai is a phrase in Black Speech, spoken by an unidentified Orcs of Mordor, possibly Grishnákh. It was a phrase used to express a certain contempt in the handling of the prisoners Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, aimed at Uglúk and the Orcs of Isengard.
