Lorgan was the chief of the Easterlings (First Age) forces that occupied Hithlum.  
== History ==
After Morgoths victory in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Lorgans people were given parts of the Northlands. Lorgan claimed the lordship of the northern land of Dor-lómin, which had been ruled by Húrin until he was captured in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
=== Lorgan and Tuor ===
Lorgans Men and Orcs launched an attack on the Elves that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Tuor to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years, after which he managed to escape. He harried the lands as an outlaw, and Lorgan put a price on his head, but after a further four years Tuor disappeared from the north. Lorgan surely never discovered why his foe had vanished: Tuor had set out through the Gate of the Noldor on a journey that would lead him to Turgon in Gondolin.
=== Lorgan and Húrin ===
Twenty-eight years after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Morgoth pretended pity for the steadfastness of Húrin Thalion who was his prisoner all these years; in actuality it was part of a plan to spread his malice.  In a cunning stroke, Morgoth sent Húrin to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honour.  This caused the people of Hithlum, both the Easterlings and the enslaved Men of Dor-lómin to believe that Húrin was in league with the Dark Lord.  Húrins bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.  He was allowed to wander about the land untouched due to the Easterlings fear that to do so would put them in Morgoths disfavour.
Húrin acquired only a small following, composed of Asgon and six others.  Deciding to leave Hithlum, Húrin marched up to the halls of Lorgan to look upon him and his men in scorn and to announce his departure.  Lorgan was glad that Húrin was going and asked his "friend" to tell Morgoth that Húrin had not been ill-treated during his stay.  Húrin rejected Lorgans friendship and announced that his supposed service under Morgoth was a lie.  At this, Lorgans men drew swords to kill Húrin but Lorgan restrained them.  More cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived the purpose of Morgoth in letting Húrin go free.  He told Húrin to go and wished him ill., pp. 252-254
