Galathil was a grandson of King Thingols brother Elmo, and himself the brother of Celeborn, the Lord of Lórien. His daughter Nimloth of Doriath wedded Dior, Thingols Heir, and so Galathil was a distant ancestor of both Elrond and Aragorn.
== Etymology ==
Galathil and his close kin shared names with the White Tree (disambiguation).
The conception of this name was based on Tolkiens idea that Celeborns name was first devised to mean Silver Tree, and his close kin all had tree-names.  Although he later changed what he wanted Celeborns name to mean, refering to silver and tall from the adjective ornā (uprising, tall) instead of silver and tree from the noun ornē (tree), he did not revise the name meanings of his close kin. 
Based on Tolkiens original version of the familys names, Galathil is a name that can be seen in the tree name Galathilion, which was another name for Telperion. This was also the name of the White Tree of Tirion, Galathilion the Less, and its seedlings were Celeborn in Eressëa and Nimloth in Númenor.  In The Lord of the Rings, Galathilion was the tree of Tol Eressëa, and Nimloth (tree) was its seedling.
