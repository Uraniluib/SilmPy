Númenor (Quenya: "westland", pron. ) or Númenórë (pron. ), known in the Westron as Westernesse and in Adûnaic as Anadûnê, was one of the names of the isle of Elenna, which was raised from the Belegaer by the Valar in the beginning of the Second Age. While strictly speaking the term Númenor referred to the realm established on the island, it was more often used as a synonym of the land itself. Númenor was one of the most powerful realms of the Second Age, and its people, called Númenóreans, as well as their descendants, had considerable influence on the events of the Third Age.
==Geography==
The island of Númenor had a shape of a 5-point star, each point having its own unique geological and physical features: Forostar, Andustar, Hyarnustar, Hyarrostar and Orrostar.
The central region was named Mittalmar and in its center stood the holy mountain Meneltarma
Númenor had only two rivers: Siril and Nunduinë.
Cities built by the Númenóreans were Armenelos, Andúnië, Nindamos, Eldalondë and Almaida. 
==History==
===Origin===
Númenor was the kingdom of the Dúnedain, located on an island in the Belegaer, between Middle-earth and Aman. The land was brought up from the sea as a gift to Men. It was also called Elenna ("Starwards") because the Dúnedain were led to it by the Star of Eärendil, and because the island was in the shape of a five-pointed star. The Dúnedain arrived at the island in the year , and the Drúedain refugees who dwelt at the Mouths of Sirion before the sinking of Beleriand were permitted to join them.
Elros son of Eärendil was the first King of Númenor, taking the name of Elros ("First King"). Under his rule, which took place between  and  and those of his descendants, Men rose to become a powerful race. 
The Númenóreans were forbidden by the Valar from sailing so far westward that Númenor was no longer visible, for fear that they would come upon the Undying Lands, from which Men were barred. Over time the Númenóreans came to resent the Ban of the Valar and to rebel against their authority, seeking the everlasting life that they believed was begrudged them. They tried to compensate for this by going eastward and colonizing large parts of Middle-earth, first in a friendly way, beginning with Tar-Aldarion. The first ships sailed from Númenor to Middle-earth in the year . 
The Númenóreans established several settlements in Middle-earth, such as Lond Daer. They contacted the Middle Men, teaching them several crafts, instructed them and helped free them from the Shadow. About SA 1200 they established permanent settlements like Pelargir and Umbar.
In  Tar-Minastir sent a fleet to help Gil-galad and together they drove back Sauron, who had dominated almost all Eriador after the War of the Elves and Sauron.

Soon the Númenóreans came to become proud and discontented, irritated by the Ban of the Valar. Starting to lose the meaning of the Gift of Men and envious of immortality, they longed for Eldamar which they saw only from a distance.
About  they started to dominate the shores of Middle-earth and demand tribute from the lesser peoples which they had liberated and taught, and became a massive brutal maritime empire that had no rival. Fearing death, they tried to gain some immortality in riches and ornate tombs. Tar-Atanamir started to speak openly against the Valar.
In  Umbar was strengthened with increased numbers of colonists and from there they began to dominate Harad. Even Sauron was afraid of them and retreated from these lands.
A few of them, the Faithful, remained loyal to the Valar and friendly to the Elves. The Valar displayed warnings to the Men of Westernesse in the form of huge eagles, but they paid no heed to these manifestations. The Faithful were persecuted by the majority of the population, which they called Kings Men, who decided to abandon the Elven customs and languages. Ar-Adûnakhôr took his regal name in Adûnaic and not in Quenya.
The Faithful remained in Andúnië and the Faithful Lords of Andúnië, because of their noble heritage still had some gravity in the meetings of nobles. However, in the 32nd century Ar-Gimilzôr forced them to remove to Rómenna and the haven was closed to the Elven visitors. Tar-Palantir briefly attempted to cast the Shadow back and reunite the people with the Elves and the Valar, but did not make it to be. He was succeeded by his nephew, a sea captain who warred against the coastal people.
That nephew was the twenty-fifth king, Ar-Pharazôn, who in the year , sailed to Middle-earth. Seeing the might of Númenor, Sauron submitted to the kings authority, and he was brought back to Númenor as a hostage. By that time, however, the Drúedain of Númenor had sensed a coming darkness and all of them had abandoned the island for Middle-earth. Sauron soon became an adviser to the King as Tar-Sauron, and promised the Númenóreans eternal life if they worshiped Morgoth. With Sauron as his advisor, Ar-Pharazôn had a 500-foot temple to Melkor erected, in which he offered human sacrifices to him.  
During this time, the white tree Nimloth of Númenor, whose fate was said to be tied to the line of kings, was chopped down and burned as a sacrifice to Melkor.  Risking his life, Isildur rescued a fruit of the tree, preserving the ancient line of trees.

===Destruction===

Prompted by Sauron and fearing death and old age, Ar-Pharazôn built a great armada and set sail into the west to make war upon the Valar and seize the Undying Lands. Sauron remained behind. In the year , Ar-Pharazôn landed on Amans shores and marched to the city of Valimar.
Fearing that the Númenorean army could wrack havoc in Valinor, but forbidden from killing or otherwise using force against Men,, p. 350 the Valar called upon Ilúvatar for assistance. He broke and changed the world, taking Aman and Tol Eressëa from the world forever, and changing the worlds shape from flat to round. Númenor was covered by great waves and sank into the abyss, killing its inhabitants, including the body of Sauron; Sauron was robbed of his ability to assume fair and charming forms.
Elendil, son of the leader of the Faithful during the reign of Ar-Pharazôn, his sons and his followers had foreseen the disaster that was to befall Númenor, and they had set sail in nine ships before the island fell. They landed in Middle-earth, and gathered the Númenorian and indigenous peoples living there, uniting them under them, as the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.
After its fall Númenor was called Atalantë, meaning "the Downfallen", in the Quenya language. Other names after the Downfall include Mar-nu-Falmar ("Land under the Waves") and Akallabêth ("the Downfallen" in Adûnaic).
The story of the rise and downfall of Númenor is told in Akallabêth.
==Culture==
The population of Númenor chiefly consisted of Edain, mostly descendants from the House of Hador; although before the Shadow fell on the island the westernmost cities such as Andúnië contained a small population of Elves because of the frequent visits from Tol Eressëa. They were known as the Númenóreans, or rather, Kings among Men.
There also was a small number of Drúedain living in Númenor, who, considered as Edain, accompanied their friends of the House of Haleth to Númenor. They were only few in number and dreaded the sea. They became uneasy when Tar-Aldarion started his great travels and urged him not to go, seeing the mischief to come. They did not succeed and one after another they took ships towards Middle-earth, saying, that "the Great Isle no longer feels sure under our feet, and we wish to return to the lands whence we came". The last of them left when Sauron was brought to Númenor.
==Etymology==
Númenor is a shortened form of the name Númenórë. The name is a compound of númen "going down" (from the Sundocarme √ndū, nū), sunset, West, and nóre "land, country".
==Inspiration==
Númenor is the retelling of the Atlantis mythos in Tolkiens legendarium. Notably, he referred to a recurring "Atlantis dream" he had. The connection is more evident in the name Atalantë, another epithet of the Island which in Quenya means "the downfallen" (note that in Greek, Atlantis is related to Wikipedia:Atlas; therefore Atalantë has no direct connection).
wikipedia:Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher, recounted the myth of Atlantis. According to him, Atlantis was in the middle of the ocean in the West (cf. Belegaer), its people were more advanced than those of the known world (cf. Kings of Men) but were corrupted by arrogance; the continent was destroyed by the gods and survivors created colonies, as in Egypt (cf. Realms in Exile). Also according to Plato the center of Atlantis was occupied by a high mountain-palace (cf. Meneltarma) around which a city of three circles was build, quite different from the star-shaped island of Númenor. Another element with both common and different points between the two stories, is that Númenor sank when the fleet was attacking the West, while Atlantis sank during a sea-battle with the Athenians, in the east.
Some parts of Númenors history seem to have been inspired not only from Plato but also from researchers and occultists whose theories were widespread during Tolkiens time.
Ignatius Loyola Donnelly and Edgar Cayce were the most famous authors regarding Atlantis and mentioned events and concepts that Plato never did. One of those "original" elements told by modern authors and mystics was a civil war between two factions of Atlanteans (good and evil)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_race#The_civilization_of_Atlantis which reminds of the persecution of the Elf-friends by the Kings Men.
According to those theories, remnants of Atlantean civilization survived by colonists or survivors in Egypt (and in Pre-Columbian America), which mirrors the Realms in Exile founded by the Faithful; furthermore Tolkien once equated the Gondorians with the Egyptian civilization.
==Uses outside the legendarium==
C.S. Lewis novel That Hideous Strength makes reference to "Numinor sic and the True West", which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of J.R.R. Tolkien. This is one of many examples of cross-overs between the novels of Lewis and Tolkien, both of whom were members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group at Oxford University.
