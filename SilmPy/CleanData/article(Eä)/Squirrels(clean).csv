Squirrels were nut-eating rodents often found in trees. Most would have been red or grey, but in Mirkwood, the squirrels were black in colour.
==Nature of the black squirrels==
During their journey through Mirkwood, Thorin and his company killed a black squirrel for food, but found it to be inedible.
John D. Rateliff has suggested that the black squirrels are "dark in coloration" (like the other animals the company meet in Mirkwood), "no doubt from protective camouflage in a dimly lit environment"., "VIII. Mirkwood: Text Notes", p. 317. Henry Gee, discussing the topic of Wikipedia:Melanism in Middle-earth, accepts the complexity of the subject (as black creatures often can be said to having been created or used by Morgoth and Sauron), but concludes that dark creatures per se are not "evil" in the works of Tolkien: "black creatures, whether swans, butterflies or squirrels, are remarkable only inasmuch as there are light-colored forms with which they can be contrasted."Henry Gee, "http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081104_01.html Melanism in Middle-earth", as of 21 September 2010
