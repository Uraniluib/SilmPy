Little Gelion was a lesser river that rose beneath Himring in the north marches of Beleriand, whose spring was close by that of the Celon. Where the Celon ran southwest towards the borders of Doriath, the Little Gelion followed a twisting course to the southeast, where it joined with the Greater Gelion to form the long river Gelion itself.  The river formed the southwest border of the ward of Maglor.
