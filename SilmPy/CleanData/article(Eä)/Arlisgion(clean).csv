In an earlier version of the legendarium Arlisgion or the Place of Reeds were names for the fenland region later known as Lisgardh.
In The Fall of Gondolin (chapter) it is described as being located to the south of Dor-l√≥min but separated from it by the Iron Mountains. Tuor stayed there for a while before departing for the "yet more lovely" Nan-tathren.
