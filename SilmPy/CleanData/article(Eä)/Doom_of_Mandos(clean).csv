The Doom of Mandos, also called the Doom of the Noldor, the Curse of Mandos, and the Prophecy of the North, was the judgement of the Valar (believed to have been spoken personally by Mandos) pronounced on the Noldorin Elves who carried out the Kinslaying at Alqualondë at Alqualondë in Eldamar. It was given to the Noldor in the lands of Araman north of Valinor as a warning of the woe that would come upon them if they continued in their rebellion against the Valar and did not repent of their killing of the innocent Falmarin Elves. A part of the Doom goes as follows:
:"Nirnaeth Arnoediad ye shall shed; and the Valar will Nurtale Valinoreva against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over Pelóri. On the House of Fëanor the wrath of the Valar lieth from the Uttermost West unto the uttermost East, and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also. Their Oath of Fëanor shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very Silmarils that they have sworn to pursue. To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever. ..."
The pronunciation of this Doom was the immediate cause for the full repentance of Finarfin (already reluctant to proceed) and his followers, and their return to Tirion. There they asked and received the forgiveness of the Valar.
However, nine-tenths of the Noldor (as well as a handful of others such as the Vanya Elenwë and the Falmar Teleporno who each accompanied their Noldorin spouses) continued on their way to Beleriand to fight Morgoth, and the disastrous Wars of Beleriand they waged there fulfilled the prophetic Doom.

Most would not survive, and none who died in exile save two (Finrod and Glorfindel) would be re-embodied before the War of Wrath that would finally end the First Age.  Forgiveness and pardon for most would not come until then.  For some, it did not come even then, such as for the prideful Galadriel who would only at last prove her necessary penitence at the very end of the Third Age.
Fëanor and Sons of Fëanor would remain unpardoned for other reasons, namely their unfulfillable Oath.  This would make it impossible for the survivor Maglor to return until the Silmarils do.
