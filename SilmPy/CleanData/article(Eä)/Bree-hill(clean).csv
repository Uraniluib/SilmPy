Bree-hill was the most prominent point in the Bree-land, on the slopes of which stood the villages of Bree itself (to the southwest) and Staddle (to the southeast).
The portion of the hill that consisted of Bree was borrowed by hobbit-holes where Bree-hobbits resided. This was possibly also the case with Staddle.
