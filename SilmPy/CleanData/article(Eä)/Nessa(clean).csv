Nessa was the wife of Tulkas and sister of Oromë. In "due order," Nessa was the last named Valier. 
==History==
Nessa was noted for her speed, swift as an arrow, and ability to outrun the Deer who followed her in the wild. She was also renowned for her dancing ability, as she danced on the ever-green lawns of Valimar. She wed Tulkas upon the Isle of Almaren in the Years of the Lamps 3400., 3400 
Nessa loved to retire to the green swards which her brother, Oromë, had cultivated from the richness of his forest. When creating the forests of Oromë, Yavanna had planted forest glades with spells so that the glades would always remain green and smooth, and Nessa along with her maidens would dance there as long as Laurelin was in bloom.
==Etymology==
Nessa () is a Quenya word meaning "young"; in the same text, Nessa has also the name Indis "bride"., pp. 376-7 
The Noldorin names of Nessa were Neth (a cognate of the Quenya/Qenya word) or Dineth, a Noldorin word meaning "bride", related to the Quenya word indis., entry NI1
In a later text, Pengolodh notes that Nessas name is "not elvish" and probably represents a Valarin title, much like the name of her spouse, adopted in Quenya, but there is no record.
===Early etymology===
Her names were Helinyetille meaning "Eyes of Heartsease", from helin ("violet, pansy"), and Melesta, from mele ("to love").
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales, Nessa was one of the Valarindi, daughter of Aule and Yavanna. Her son with Tulkas was Telimektar.
Nessa was seen at the House of Tulkas bringing goblets of wine and drinks to his champions.
