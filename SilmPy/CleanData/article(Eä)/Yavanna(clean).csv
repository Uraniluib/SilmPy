Yavanna Kementári (Quenya, pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin ) was a Valar, the Queen of Earth. Also known as Giver of Fruits, she was responsible for all growing things.
==Attributes==
Yavanna was one of the Aratar and was next to Varda in reverence. She was the elder "sister" of Vána and the consort of Aulë. She was responsible for all things that grew in the earth, from the towering trees to the moss on the rocks.  
Her usual form was that of a tall woman robed in green. She has also been seen in the form of a tall tree growing from the waters of Ulmo to the winds of Manwe spilling golden dew from her branches, which made the barren earth green with corn.  
Melian of the Maiar was of her kin.
==History==
File:Jacek Kopalski - Yavannas Trees.jpg
In the Song of the Ainur Yavanna sung of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of Manwe and Ulmo, and some trees sang to Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the Trees. Her thought also met with Manwes, setting the arrival of the Great Eagles.
In the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of Arda and watched over the olvar and all growing things. As Morgoth was corrupting her beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the plans against him.  After his expulsion from Arda she planted the seeds that she had long devised and life came to Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda, although in the beginning no flowers bloomed.  When the Two Lamps were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered in the Sleep of Yavanna that lasted until the rising of the Moon and the Sun.
After the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and created Valinor.  Upon the green mound of Ezellohar Yavanna sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened.  Her song, with the aid of the tears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land.  However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the Elves.
After Ilúvatar allowed Aulës creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in reply, told her that even Elves and Men, the true Children of Ilúvatar would have need of her trees as well.  Yavanna lamented to Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others.  Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the Ents to protect the trees.
When the Elves built Tirion upon Tol Eressëa Yavanna fashioned the tree Galathilion, a lesser image of Telperion, for the court beneath the Mindon.
After the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the Silmarils she could heal them.  Fëanor refused to give up the Silmarils, although Morgoth had already taken them when he made this decision.   Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin.  She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun.
For the Men who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna.  When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Númenor. In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send Wizards to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.
==Etymology==
Yavanna means "Giver of Fruits" in Quenya. The name is a compound of yáve and anna. Her epithet Kementári means "Queen of the Earth".
Her Sindarin name appears to be Ivon, only attested in the compound Yavannildi ("Maidens of Yavanna").The name Ivon (variant form Ifon) was also the Gnomish form of Qenya Yavanna. Cf. , p. 273. Another form is Ivann, pp. 404-5, where it is glossed as Noldorin, also seen in the Sindarin month-name Ivanneth (Quenya: Yavannië).
