Lossarnach was a region and fiefdom in southern Gondor.
==History==
Known as the "Vale of flowers", it was a fertile region lying south of eastern end of the White Mountains. It was the region closest to Minas Tirith, which depended on the fruit cultivated in the orchards of Lossarnach. Residents of Minas Tirith were also known to make expeditions to the region to behold its renowned flowers and trees (which surely included the valley Imloth Melui).
At the end of the Third Age, its lord was the old Forlong the Fat, who led two hundred men to the aid of Minas Tirith. Forlong was killed in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but many of his men survived and accompanied Aragorn Elessar on his way to the Black Gate, even though most of them were farmers.
Lossarnach was populated by many refugees from Ithilien and Osgiliath. During the War of the Ring, most women and children from Minas Tirith were sent there.
Famous people from the region included the wise-woman Ioreth who served in the Houses of Healing of Minas Tirith, and Morwen Steelsheen, wife of King Thengel of Rohan.
==Etymology==
Lossarnach is glossed as "flowery Arnach"., pp. 513-4 (citing from the Unfinished index) While J.R.R. Tolkien seemed to be convinced that the second element, Arnach, was a Pre-Númenórean word, the first element caused more problems: since loss means "snow" in Sindarin it is unclear why it "was prefixed to Arnach", although it likely derived from likeness between loss and Sindarin loth ("flower")., p. 18
==Inspiration==
Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955) about an impending trip in 1955, J.R.R. Tolkien identified Lossarnach as Wikipedia:Assisi., p. 462
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2015: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Lossarnach was an area in the region of Eastern Gondor. It was across the river Erui from Upper Lebennin to the west and across the river Anduin from South Ithilien to the east. The Rammas Echor divided it from the Pelennor Fields to the north-east. Settlements in Lossarnach included the capital city of Arnach#Portayal in adaptations, Imloth Melui, Harlond (Gondor), and "Ost Norhir", though the latter two have fallen to the Minas Morgul-host. The emblem of Lossarnach was three red roses on a white field. Baranor, Captain of the Guard of Arnach, and the Lady Vanyalos, sister of Denethor and husband of Forlong, were in charge of the land when Forlong went to Minas Tirith.
