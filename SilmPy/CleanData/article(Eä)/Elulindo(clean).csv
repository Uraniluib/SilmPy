Elulindo was a son of Elwë, Lord of the Teleri, in a genealogical table created by Tolkien probably in the early 1930s. The table has not been published but Christopher Tolkien mentioned the name in his comments on the genealogies of "The Quenta" period in the Appendix of The Lost Road., 403
In the later versions of The Silmarillion the name of the father of Elulindo was changed from Elwë to Olwë. Olwë is told to have had many sons but none of them is known by name, nor their deeds have been recorded..
==Etymology==
The name is composed of Elu and lindo singer, probably conceived as Telerin words at the time.
