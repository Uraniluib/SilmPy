Elven rope was a rope made by the Elves of Lothlórien. During the War of the Ring, when the Fellowship of the Ring were set to depart from Lothlórien, the Galadhrim presented them with many gifts, to aid them in their quest. Among the gifts there were coils of rope. The rope was slender, but strong, silken to the touch, and grey of hue like the elven-cloaks and was able to withstand the greatest weight.

It showed no signs of having frayed so it was Sams belief that the rope untied itself.
