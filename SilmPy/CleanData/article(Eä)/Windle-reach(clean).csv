Windle-reach was a lower part of the Withywindle river beginning at the Withy-weir straight up to the Grindwall.
==Etymology==
The word "Wikipedia:Reach (geography)" can refer to any length of a river or to a level stretch between locks in a canal, but especially to "a straight portion of a stream or river, as from one turn to another"http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/glossary.html#R General Introduction and Hydrologic Definitions (Science in Your Watershed, U.S. Geological Survey). which is here the most probable explanation, as it gives a word-play combining windle winding and reach straight.See also: http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/w/windlereach.html Windle-reach (Encyclopedia of Arda).
