The House of Finarfin was the descendants and followers of Finarfin, third son of Finwë who followed Fëanor. A particular aspect of this house is that many had golden hair, due to their half-Vanyarin heritage.
During the march on Aman Finarfin himself repented when heard the Doom of Mandos and returned to the West with some of his followers.
His children, led by Finrod, came to Beleriand, and that is why his House is also named House of Finrod. Galadriel belonged to this house as well as Gildor Inglorion and perhaps Glorfindel, p. 204, entry House of Finrod. Such Elves remained in Middle-earth until the late Third Age.
