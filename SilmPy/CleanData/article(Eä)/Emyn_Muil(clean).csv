Emyn Muil was a range of hills south of the Brown Lands and north of the Nindalf.  The Anduin cut through the hills and then pooled in Nen Hithoel.  The Fellowship of the Ring rode boats through Emyn Muil before the group broke up near the southern boundary of the hills.  Afterwards Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee hiked through the difficult terrain east of the river and met Gollum just below the eastern edge of the Emyn Muil.
==Geography==
The hills rose gradually in the north with great brakes thorn and sloe, brambles and creepers.  Near the river ivy clung to grey stone chimneys and further ridges were topped with firs twisted by wind.  On three sides Emyn Muil ended in cliffs:  In the west the uplands ended abruptly in the East Wall of Rohan. In the south the Anduin cascaded over Rauros, a great waterfall.  In the east, although of lower elevation, the barren hills still ended in a steep edge.
The Anduin cut through the hills on its southward course.  In the north the river narrowed and passed through Sarn Gebir.  No boats could survive these rapids and travelers had to use a portage way on the west bank.  South of Sarn Gebir the river plunged between towering cliffs until it passed between the two great statues of the Argonath.  A little further and the pent waters opened into a long oval lake called Nen Hithoel.  On the southern end of the lake were three peaks: Amon Lhaw on the east bank, Tol Brandir amid two arms of the river, and Amon Hen on the western side.  At the foot of Amon Hen was a green clearing, Parth Galen, and south of it was the North Stair that allowed for passage to the bottom of Rauros and Emyn Muil.
==History==
