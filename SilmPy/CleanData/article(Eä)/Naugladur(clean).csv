Naugladur was the king of the Dwarves of Nogrod in The Book of Lost Tales.
== History ==
He led the Battle of the Thousand Caves against Menegroth to capture the Nauglafring. Later he fought with Beren in the Battle of Sarn Athrad and would have slain him, but stumbled and Beren slew him to reclaim the Nauglafring.  With his dying words he cursed the treasure that he was bringing back to Nogrod, which Beren dumped in the river.
== Etymology ==
The name Naugladur was never explained by J.R.R. Tolkien, but it is likely a Gnomish name meaning "King of the Dwarves".
