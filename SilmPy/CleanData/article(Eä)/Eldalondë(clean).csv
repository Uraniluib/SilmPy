Eldalondë (Quenya elda "of the Eldar" + londë "land-locked haven") was a haven on the western shores of Númenor, at the mouth of the River Nunduinë.  It was built in the middle of the coast of Númenors great western bight, between the arms of the wide Bay of Eldanna, in the region known as Nísimaldar, where the Fragrant Trees grew in high numbers.
