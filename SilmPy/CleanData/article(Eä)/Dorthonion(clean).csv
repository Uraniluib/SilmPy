Dorthonion was a forested highland region in the north of Beleriand which spanned sixty leagues from west to east. , p. 272 The hilly north-eastern section was called Ladros. Dorthonion was walled-in by the Echoriad ("Encircling Mountains") in the west and the Ered Gorgoroth ("Mountains of Terror") in the south.
From the plains of Ard-galen to the north, Dorthonion rose gradually until it became a bleak land of tarns and bare tors near the precipices of the Ered Gorgoroth. In the north and the west the land was covered with great forests of pines. The rivers Rivil and Mindeb had their sources in these uplands, as did the lake Aeluin. In the centre of the land was a tall peak called Foen., pp. 183, 187
==History==
During the tumult when the Valar broke the gates of Utumno after the awakening of the elves, the highlands of Dorthonion were first raised..
In year  of the First Age King Thingol gave permission to the Noldor to settle the northern lands of Beleriand. North Dorthonion was ruled by the Elf-lords Angrod and Aegnor and Ladros was ruled by Finrod.
Later Finrod and his people removed to Nargothrond in the south, whilst Angrod and Aegnor ruled over those of their folk who still dwelt in Dorthonion, as vassals of their brother . Ladros was then granted by High King of the Noldor Fingolfin to the House of Bëor as a fiefdom.
In  Dorthonion was overrun by the armies of Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach ("Battle of Sudden Flame") and thereafter was called Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion) ("Forest under Nightshade"). Barahir refused to forsake Dorthonion and remained with twelve companions near Tarn Aeluin. Through the treachery of Gorlim nearly all of this band were killed, save for the son of Barahir, Beren. Beren followed the Orcs who had killed his father to Rivils Well. He then killed the Orc captain and recovered the Ring of Barahir. Eventually he was pursued so closely that Beren fled from Dorthonion over the Ered Gorgoroth.
Many, many years later, on 29 February, , Treebeard chanted to Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took as he carried them through Fangorn Forest and he mentioned "To the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the Winter."
==Etymology==
Dorthonion means "Land of the Pine Trees" in Sindarin (from dôr = "land, dwelling-place" and thôn = "pine tree").
In a philological fragment of uncertain date it is stated that Dorthonion was also called Taur-na-Foen, the Forest of the Foen., p. 187
