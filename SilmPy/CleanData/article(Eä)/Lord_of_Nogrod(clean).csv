Lord of Nogrod was a title given to the one who ruled over the Dwarf city of Dwarf. 
Though there were presumably many Lords through the history of that First Age, only one appears in records, and even that Lord is not named. He led the Battle of the Thousand Caves against Menegroth to capture the Nauglafring. Later he fought with Beren in the Battle of Sarn Athrad and would have slain him, but stumbled and Beren slew him to reclaim the Nauglafring.  With his dying words, he cursed the treasure that he was bringing back to Nogrod, which Beren dumped in the river.
In The Book of Lost Tales, Naugladur was the king of the Dwarves of Nogrod, p. 225 who led the Battle of the Thousand Caves against Menegroth and fought with Beren in the Battle of Sarn Athrad.
