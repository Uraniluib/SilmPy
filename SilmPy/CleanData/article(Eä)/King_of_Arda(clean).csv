King of Arda was a title given to Manwë, greatest of the Valar, and held to be the ruler of the realm of Arda. 
When Ainur came to Arda, before it was fully formed, Melkor claimed it for himself. Manwë denied this and spirits came to his side from the deeps of Ea, beginning the First War. The battle resulted to the rulership of the Valar with Manwe as their head, and Melkor ever coveting its rule.
