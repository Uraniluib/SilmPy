The Brown Lands (Sindarin Berennyr) or Noman-lands was a region east of the Anduin between Mirkwood to the north and the Emyn Muil to the south.  
The area was the home of the Entwives who made their gardens there; but during the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, they were driven away when Sauron ruined the land against the advance of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men down the Anduin. Thenceforth the area became a desolate desert with arid moors. The Ents vainly had crossed the Anduin in search of the Entwives. Treebeard appeared convinced that the Entwives were not all destroyed but were "lost".
Even by the end of the Third Age, when the Fellowship of the Ring drifted by in boats upon the Great River, they saw only long, formless slopes with a withered look, without trees or even grass.  What had caused such desolation not even Aragorn could tell.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkien describes in his unfinished index (for The Lord of the Rings) the Brown Lands as a translation of Berennyr (a pluralized compound of Sindarin baran (Sindarin) brown, yellow-brown and dôr land) "a devastated region, east of Anduin, between Lothlórien and the Emyn Muil"., p. 343 (quoting from the manuscript "Index questions")
