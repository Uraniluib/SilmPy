Herumor was a Black Númenóreans who lived in the late Second Age. After the Downfall of Númenor he, along with Fuinur, rose to power among the Haradrim and served Sauron.
== Etymology ==
Herumor means "Black Lord" in Quenya (from heru = "lord" and morë = "dark").
==Portrayal in adaptations==
In the defunct Middle-earth Role Playing game from the 1980s, Herumor is given an extended history. Fuinur is then his older brother. J.R.R. Tolkien, however, had nothing to do with writing this history.
