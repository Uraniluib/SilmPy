Aelin-uial, or the Meres of Twilight, was a marshy confluence of the river Aros into Sirion, south of Doriath.
==Location==
The Aelin-uial was the maze of lakes and Fens of Sirion formed where the river Aros met the Sirion, before it fell beneath the Andram. These were lands heavy with enchantment from the Girdle of Melian guarding Doriath to the north of the Aelin-uial, and also from the power of Ulmo the Valar, which was very strong in this area.
At the southernmost end of the Aelin-uial, the waters of Sirion met once more at the Falls of Sirion.
==History==
The Aelin-uial was under the control of Doriath. Thingols Marchwardens kept secret ferries among the reeds, which they could use to cross in between Sirions eastern and western banks unseen by anyone.
It was here that Turgon and Finrod slept and Ulmo put into their dreams the idea of building their hidden strongholds located at Gondolin and Nargothrond.  It was also in the meres that the Elves who guarded the western marches of Doriath found Húrin, whom they then brought before King Thingol.
==Etymology==
Aelin-uial is a Sindarin name, composed of aelin "meres", plural of ael + uial "twilight".
A variant name used by J.R.R. Tolkien was Umboth Muilin (also spelt Umboth-muilin and Umboth-Muilin), which translates to "Pools of Twilight"., pp. 451-2 Helge Fauskanger has noted that the Noldorin name Oelinuial ("Pools of Twilight"; variant forms Elinuial and EilinuialDavid Salo, "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/2068 AE and OE (message 2028)" at Elfling), of the The Etymologies, became Aelin-uial in the published The Silmarillion.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/index/indexs.htm Index to the Etymologies - Explanation" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 18 September 2011)
Yet another, early form, was the Gnomish name Hithliniath ("Pools of Mist"; which was amended to Umboth Muilin, itself amended to Aelinuial)., p. 194 (§111)
