The Broadbeams were one of the seven houses of the Dwarves. They were originally paired with the Firebeards. The ancestor of the Broadbeams was among the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves (together with the ancestors of the Firebeards and Longbeards)., p. 301
The Broadbeams (with the Firebeards) awoke in Dolmed in the Blue Mountains, and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains, and dwelt in them before their ruining in the War of Wrath. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.  In an The Book of Lost Tales Part Two the two cities are clearly inhabited by separate houses; however, Belegost is said to be the home of the Durins Folk.
In the Second Age, around the year , the Firebeards and Broadbeams who lived in Nogrod and Belegost left the destruction behind and came to Khazad-dûm, increasing its wealth and power.
