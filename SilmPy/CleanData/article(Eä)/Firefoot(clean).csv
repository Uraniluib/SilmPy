Firefoot was the horse ridden by Éomer of the Rohirrim, at least on the journey from Edoras to Helms Deep (during which Gimli was also a passenger on Firefoots back). Firefoot is never specifically described, but we can probably gain an impression of the animals appearance from the other horses of Éomers éored: large and grey-coated with a braided mane and a long tail.
