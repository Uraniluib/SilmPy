The Avari (Quenya: "unwilling"; or "the Refusers", p. 312) were a branch of Elves that refused to make the Great Journey.
==History==
The original Elves that Awakening of the Elves in Cuiviénen numbered 144, and they were divided into three clans: the Minyar, which had 14 members; the Tatyar, which had 56 members; and the Nelyar (or Lindar), which had 74 members. After the Vala Oromë invited the Elves to live in Valinor, the Elves entered into a great debate on whether to follow Oromë into the west. Most of the Elves were persuaded to undertake this Great Journey, including all of the Minyar, half of the Tatyar, and 46 of the Nelyar. These Elves became known collectively  as the Eldar, and their clans became known by new names: the Minyar Eldar were called the Vanyar, the Tatyar Eldar were called the Noldor, and the Nelyar Eldar were called the Teleri., pp. 380-83
Those Elves who refused to take the Great Journey were called the Avari, and they were not counted among the Eldar., p. 41 Their initial population had 56 members, consisting of 28 (half) of the Tatyar and 28 of the Nelyar, the latter of whom maybe were called Lindai. Some of them, especially those who dwelt furthest from the waters of Cuiviénen and wandered in the hills, had not seen Oromë at his first coming, and knew only vague, fearful rumours of the Valar; lies of Melkor concerning Oromë and Nahar perhaps had a role. Many thus refused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. According to a tradition their leaders were Morwë of the Tatyar and Nurwë of the Nelyar. They were after known by the name "the Unwilling" because they refused the summons.
According to the legends, Orcs may be descended from Avarin elves captured and corrupted by Morgoth.
Over time, many Avari wandered westwards. Some mingled with the Nandor of the Vales of Anduin, and others entered Eriador., pp. 409-410 Some time after the Laiquendi settled in Beleriand, some Avari "crept in small and secret groups into Beleriand from the South.", p. 377 Most of these Avari remained secretive and isolated from the other elves, living in caves and deep in the forests. They viewed the Eldar with jealousy and disdain, believing that the Eldar were deserters, and they treated the Eldar with hostility and treachery. They especially disliked the exiled Noldor who returned from Aman. Rarely, an Avar was accepted into Sindarin society. Outside of Beleriand, in Eriador and the Values of Anduin, some Avari and Eldar eventually established friendlier relations. 
The Edain who travelled to the West met the Avari first of all the Elves, and were taught from them music and language, which influenced theirs. They probably taught them many of the basic crafts of civilization, though the craft of the Eldar surpassed that of the Avari even more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive Men.
Some Avari after the end of the First Age started to mingle with the scattered Nandor beyond the Misty Mountains and they became hardly distinguishable from them, afterwards known as Silvan Elves.
It is told that no Avari Elves were to be found west of the Misty Mountains during the late Third Age., p. 53
==Tribes==
Six tribes of Avari are mentioned in the Third Age, and their names are all cognates of the Primitive Quendian word Quendi (the Speakers): Kindi, Cuind, Hwenti, Windan, Kinn-lai, Penni., Note 9
==Languages==
The Avari had many tribes and greatly varied languages, widely sundered from one another., p.410 The names above are the only certain Avarin words ever mentioned by the Loremasters. 
It is also possible that the name Eöl is an Avarin one.
It is speculated also that Dorwinion was an Avarin land.http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=fr&pg=36
==Names==
The Avari were called Abari in Telerin; they were also called Moripendi (an equivalent of Quenya Moriquendi which referred to the Sindar as well).
In Sindarin they were called Evair, Morben or Mornedhel.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In older versions of the legendarium, the name Avari was originally that of the later Eldar, then meaning "those that departed".
In other, relatively late writings, a brief idea was that the Avari did not come from the three clans, but from two other clans, led by Nurwë and Morwë. This idea was later dropped. In the final conception, the Elves were divided into three tribes.
