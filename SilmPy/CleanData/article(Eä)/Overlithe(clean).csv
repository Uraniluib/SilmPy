Overlithe was the leap day of the Shire Calendar. It was added as an extra day every four years to accommodate annual deficits between a 365-day calendar and the actual length of a year (which is a little under a quarter of a day longer) except when this year was the last of the century. 
Overlithe occurred between Mid-years Day and the second of the two normal Lithedays (2 Lithe). It was treated as a special holiday by the inhabitants of the Shire.
