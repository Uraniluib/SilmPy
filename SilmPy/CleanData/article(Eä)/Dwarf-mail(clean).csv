Dwarf-mail refers to the shirts of linked rings (or chain mail). It is classed as dwarf-mail, as in the First Age, the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains fashioned the finest steel that Middle-earth had ever seen. In Belegost, the famous Dwarf-mail of linked rings was first made.
Many of these shirts of dwarf-mail came into the possession of the Elves of Beleriand. One such shirt and dwarf-mask was gifted to TÃºrin Mormegil during his time in Nargothrond.
