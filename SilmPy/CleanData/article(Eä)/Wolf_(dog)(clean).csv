Wolf was one of the three Dogs kept by Farmer Maggot, a Hobbits of the Shire. The folk of the Marish near the Shires eastern borders were untrusting of strangers and cautious of intruders. Farmer Maggot was one of these, and to protect himself from unwanted visitors he kept three large dogs: Grip, Fang (dog) and Wolf. All three dogs were wolf-like in appearance, which is doubtless the source of Wolfs name. Of the three, circumstantial evidence suggests that Wolf was the largest, and the one who threatened Frodo Baggins when he encountered Maggot while travelling to Buckland.
