The Mahûd are a Mannish people that appear in the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game. Their inspiration comes from the riders of the Mûmakil in The Lord of the Rings (film series). Their name appears to derive from the Hindi word for elephant rider - Mahout.
The Mahûd are described as inhabiting the deserts of Far Harad, where they tame and train the Mûmakil. Due to the climate, they wear light clothing (keeping their arms and legs bare) and ride camels instead of horses. They have little, if any, knowledge of metal-working, and their armour and weapons are mostly made of wood and bone. These weapons include spears, daggers, clubs and blowpipes, the Mahûd also carrying large wicker shields. In battle, the Mahûd ride in howdahs atop Mûmakil and attach sharpened tusks to the flanks of their camels, which impale foes in a charge. Kings have occasionally arisen among the Mahûd, but their violent and fluid political culture means few last for very long. Leadership normally goes to the best warrior, with people often defecting to another tribe if their chieftain is a more capable fighter.Matthew Ward, The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game: Harad, Games Workshop, 2007
