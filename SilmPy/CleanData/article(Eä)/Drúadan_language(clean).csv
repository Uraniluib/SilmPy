The Drúadan language referred to the tongue of the Woses., p. 99
==Characteristics==
The voices of the Drúedain are said to have been "deep and guttural", possibly also describing the sound of their language as Ghân-buri-Ghâns accent when using Westron is described with the very same words.
Helge Fauskanger has noted that the Drúadan tongue appears to be unrelated to the Westron. According to a late manuscript by J.R.R. Tolkien, it had possibly been influenced by Elvish (at least for the word gorgûn)., p. 391

==Names==
In a manuscript by Tolkien written in the late 1950s, he uses the name Druadan (also referring to a member of the Drúedain in The Lord of the Rings; amended to Drúadan in the second edition) for the language of the Woses.
This seems to be the only occurrence where Tolkien uses a name for this tongue: since the manuscript was published as late as 2007, fans and scholars have often used the unattested name Drúedainic to refer to the same tongue.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm Various Mannish Tongues - the sadness of Mortal Men?" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/index.html Ardalambion (accessed 28 December 2010)Andreas Moehn, http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html Etymologies of the Atani Languages at http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/M-earth.html Middle-earth Science Pages (accessed 31 July 2011)http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/15239 Message 15239 (dated 23 May 2002) at Elfling (mailing list)
