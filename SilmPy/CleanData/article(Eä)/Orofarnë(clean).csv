Orofarnë was one of the rowans of Fangorn Forest, much beloved by the Ents Quickbeam. It was cut down by Orcs of Isengard, arousing the anger of this impulsive Ent.
==Etymology==
In a letter, J.R.R. Tolkien explained that orofarne means "mountain-dwelling" in High-elven (Quenya). In another manuscript he glossed Orofarnë as "mountain ash", consisting of the Quenya elements Oron#Quenya ("hill") + farnë?/pharne ("any growing thing or plant")., p. 83
Editors Carl F. Hostetter and Patrick H. Wynne have made a connection between the Qenya word farne ("foliage"; a derivative of the Sundocarme PHAS-, also appearing under the rejected Sundocarme PHARAN-) and the name Orofarnë., p. 9
