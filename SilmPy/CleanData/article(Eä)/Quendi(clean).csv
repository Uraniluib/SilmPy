The Quendë (Quenya, pron. ), plural Quendi (pron. ), was the name given by the Elves to their own kind while they still dwelt at Cuiviénen.  Quendë means "speaker; who speak with voices", for upon arising they met no other living thing that spoke or sang.  However, Ilúvatar also called them Quendi before any of them awoke.
The plural form was much more popular as a word.
The word is a direct derivative of the Primitive Quendian word Kwende from Sundocarmë KWENE., KWEN(ED)
Quendë is an exceptional case where the PQ short final -e was retained in Quenya instead of disappearing.
