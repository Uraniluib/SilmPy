The Walls of Moria were the western rocky cliffs at the base of the Misty Mountains.
The Doors of Durin were built upon that surface, and by the craft of its makers, the doorway blended into it when closed.
Before the Walls, there was a shallow valley climbing westward to a small cliff and then to a road between the Stair Falls, and the ancient Eregion
