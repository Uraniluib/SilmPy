The Noldolantë, meaning "The Fall of the Noldor", was a lament composed by Maglor, a famed minstrel and the second son of Fëanor.  The song told of events Maglor himself took part: Fëanors rebellion against the Valar, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë at Alqualondë, in which Fëanor led the first ever slaying of Elves by Elves, and the Exile of the Noldor in Middle-earth.
