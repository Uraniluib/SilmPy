The Northfarthing was the cold northern Farthings of the Shire.
==Geography==
The Northfarthing is the only one of the four farthings that doesnt end in the Three-Farthing Stone; its southernmost point lay about eleven miles north of it and along its northern border were the high North Moors.
It had fresh and fragrant air; when Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee entered Ithilien for the first time, the air of the region reminded them of the uplands of the Northfarthing.
The North Moors was the only place in the Shire where heavy snow was common.
===Geographic Features===
The farthing contains Bindbole Wood, a river (perhaps the Norbourn), and the Northway Road that led to the town of Oatbarton.
Northfarthing was rocky, and settlements like Hardbottle were delved in or made from its stones., p. 771
A branch of the Took Family called the North-took Family lived in a town called Long Cleeve. Given the reference to the north (when most Tooks lived in the Westfarthing), Long Cleeve was probably located in the Northfarthing.
==History==
The only notable historic event that ever occurred in the Northfarthing was the Battle of Greenfields (). It was the only battle fought with the boundaries of the Shire until the Battle of Bywater.
Around the time of the War of the Ring, Halfred Gamgee removed to Northfarthing.
