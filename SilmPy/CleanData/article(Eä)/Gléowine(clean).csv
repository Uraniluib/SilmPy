Gléowine was a Minstrels of the Kings of Rohan of Rohan in the late Third Age.
==History==
Gléowine composed an immortalizing song about Théoden and his ancestors after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It was said that he never composed another song afterwards. Sadly, only the last stanza survived: 

Out of doubt, out of dark, to the days rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.
