Sancho Proudfoot (b. ) was a Hobbits of the Shire.
==History==
The son of Olo Proudfoot, at the age of eleven, Sancho was present at the Bilbos Farewell Party of his uncle Bilbo Baggins, along with his father and grandfather Odo Proudfoot. 
The day after, on 23 September, , he went to Bag End to seek for a treasure he heard rumours about. Frodo Baggins could just stop him, but not after Sancho had already started excavating the pantry, where he thought he heard an echo.
==Etymology==
Jim Allan recognizes the name as one of the short meaningless Hobbitish names, Giving of Names, p. 192 in which case it probably represents genuine Hobbitish Sancha.
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sancho Sancho is a real Spanish name which derives from Latin sanctius "holy". This makes Sancho one of the very few Spanish names appearing in the legendarium.
==Portrayal in adaptations==

:A young Hobbit named Sancho Proudfoot - or, the "dread highwayman Sancho Proudfoot ", as he prefers to call himself - causes quite some mischief in Hobbiton and Bywater. Several of the early missions the player - as Frodo - has to do involve solving problems caused by Sancho, such as retrieving a metal pin of the Old Mill and Old Noakes medicinal herbs.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game), levels "Hobbiton" and "Bywater"
