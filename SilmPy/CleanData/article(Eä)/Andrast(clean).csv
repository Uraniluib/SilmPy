Andrast was a long cape in the south-west of Gondor.  At the end was a great headland called Ras Morthil., Note 6
The cape was nominally part of Gondor, but it was not populated by the Númenor. At the end of the Third Age, it was believed the area was still populated by tribes of the Drúedain and other hostile men. The Drúedain were notorious for using poisoned arrows.
The Drúadan lands actually extended north along the coast on to the rivers Adorn and Sîr Angren, and were collectively known as Drúwaith Iaur or "Old Púkel land".
The White Mountains ended their southward bend at the Andrast, and as such it formed an effective barrier to invaders from the north for Gondor. There were no passes over it, so all had to venture around the Ras Morthil.
