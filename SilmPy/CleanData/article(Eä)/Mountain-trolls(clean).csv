Mountain-trolls  were used by Sauron to wield the great battering-ram, Grond (battering ram), at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Mentioned only once in the written records of Arda, nothing else is known of these creatures. One can only assume that this breed of trolls lived in some of the :Category:Mountains of Middle-earth, and that they were larger than the hill-trolls.
