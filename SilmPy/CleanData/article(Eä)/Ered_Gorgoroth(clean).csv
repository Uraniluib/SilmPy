The Ered Gorgoroth or Mountains of Terror were a mountain chain in the north of Beleriand.
The Ered Gorgoroth was the southern edge of the highlands of Dorthonion, and separated Dorthonion from Beleriand proper. South of the Gorgoroth lay the unpopulated land of Nan Dungortheb (the Valley of Dreadful Death). The southern wall of the Ered Gorgoroth fell in sheer precipices.
They were named such by the Sindar of Doriath after the Spiders-creature Ungoliant made it her temporary home, and spawned many evil spiders there, which wove webs that took away all light, and all the springs were poisoned.
The Gorgoroth had no known passes, and even the Orcs of Morgoth passed it by. In all of the First Age only Beren son of Barahir is said to have passed the mountain range, and he never spoke of this terrible journey.
Like the rest of Beleriand, the Gorgoroth were drowned during the War of Wrath, although the highland of Dorthonion survived as the isle of Tol Fuin.
==Etymology==
*Sindarin: ered + gorgor + oth
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
The Ered Gorgoroth are in one place in Beren and Lúthien referred to as "Gorgorath" apparently in order to rhyme with "path". The variation is also included in the Beren and Lúthien glossary, but the reason for the different spelling is not made clear.
