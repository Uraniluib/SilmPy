The Disaster of the Morannon was a battle in  in which King Ondoher of Gondor attempted to rout the northern alliance of Wainriders.
== Events Prior to the Battle == 
After previous defeats, the Wainriders prepared for revenge. Easterlings allied with Haradrim and Men of Khand, and attacked Gondor from two sides from north and from south.
Forthwini of Éothéod informed the King that the Wainriders had recovered from their fears and weaknesses. Ondoher also learned that Gondors southern enemies were preparing to attack. He raised as great an army as he could to meet the double threat. Ondoher divided his strength into two armies, assigning the smaller Southern Army to Eärnil at Pelargir. Ondoher himself took command of the larger Northern Army himself, which included his elder son Artamir at the Center; his sister-son Minohtar was assigned the position of Captain of the Right Wing; Adrahil I of Dol Amroth was the Captain of the Left Wing. The Éothéod also sent a force.
 
== The Battle ==
The Haradrim invaded from the south and then a few days later word came of the Wainriders invading from the east. 
Gondors host headed north through Ithilien on the alliance of Wainriders, planning to deploy upon the Dagorlad and attempting to rout them once and for all from Gondors northern borders. Minohtar followed the main force that included the Kings Guards as they approached the area in front of the Morannon. 
However, the Wainriders and their allies, bitter from previous defeats, moved faster than expected along the outskirts of the Ered Lithui attacked them with vengeance. They sent forth a swift vanguard of horsemen and charioteers that struck the head of the moving army. Ondoher had just enough time to send a message to Minohtar to cover his left flank before he and his son, with most of the Kings Guard, were annihilated. 
Minohtar then took command of the army, rallying the remaining men of the Centre and deploying his own command. It was his intention to use his forces as a rearguard to attempt to halt the Wainriders, whose main host was now approaching. Adrahils soldiers, however, were shielded from the attack and survived it. Minohtar sent Adrahil along with both his own command of the Left Wing and those at the rear of the Right Wing who had not yet been engaged. 
Later Minohtar odered Adrahil to withdraw south into Ithilien to form a defensive line from Cair Andros to the Ephel Dúath to cover the approaches of Minas Anor and allow Minohtar to form a rearguard and attempt to stem the advance of the Wainriders. Adrahil should at once message Eärnil II of the Southern Army, and inform him of the disaster of the Morannon and of the position of the retreating Northern Army.
Meanwhile, a party of Éothéod retreated to­wards the Dead Marshes. One of the soldiers who died was Faramir (son of Ondoher), the Prince of Gondor, disguised in order to fight against the will of his father. The Leader of the Éothéod went to join Minohtar at the head of the North Road in Ithilien. The Wainriders broke through Minohtars position. Late on the 13th day of Cermië Minohtar was overwhelmed and slain by an arrow. His body was carried away with the rearguard as they fled to find Adrahil. 
== Aftermath ==
The Wainriders were victorious. They celebrated at their camps after the battle, feasting in honor of their victory.
Gondor referred to the battle as The Disaster of the Morannon. It is unknown if the Wainriders gave quarter to King Ondohers forces, though it is known that his army was almost entirely crushed. Some of his troops managed to escape, however, and fled southward where they joined up with Gondors Southern Army, which quickly marched north to catch the Wainriders by surprise during their celebrations in the Battle of the Camp.
