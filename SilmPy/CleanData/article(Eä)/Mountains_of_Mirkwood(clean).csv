The Mountains of Mirkwood lay in the central parts of northern Mirkwood, north of the Old Forest Road. A jumble of fir-covered, low-lying hills to the west rose to greater heights in the east, together forming a range nearly one hundred miles in length. Historically, the Second Age saw these mountains inhabited by Silvan Elves, who knew the range as the Emyn Duir, the Dark Mountains.
During the Third Age, the power of Sauron spread across the Mountains as it did throughout the rest of the Forest, they became populated by hideous creatures. Just as Mirkwood was renamed Mirkwood at this time, its northern hills also took on a new name: Emyn-nu-Fuin, the Mountains of Mirkwood., Note 14
