The Fall of Dol Guldur was an epic battle of the War of the Ring, culminating the Rhovanion campaign.  The usual guardians, the Nazgûl, were gone, and the forces from Dol Guldur had been defeated four times by the Elves of Lórien and Mirkwood.  

== The Battle and Aftermath ==
Celeborn led the assault on 28 March, and it was within a few days captured.  After the battle, Galadriel came and threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, cleansing the forest.
On 6 April Celeborn and King Thranduil met in the midst of the forest and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen "wood of green leaves".  Celeborn took the land south of East Bight for himself and named it East Lórien, while Thranduil took all wood north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, and they gave the middle of the wood to the Beornings and Woodmen.
