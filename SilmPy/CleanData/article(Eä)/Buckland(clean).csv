Earlier editions do not have the semicolon and give the year as .
Without the semicolon, the sentence seems to imply that not only Westmarch, but also Buckland was added to the Shire in  (or  according to the old edition). 
Several reference works interpret the phrase in such a way, and refer to it as "Eastmarch", whereas such a name is not mentioned in Tolkiens text. 
Robert Foster says: Buckland was officially added to the Shire by the gift of Aragorn in FA 42 and was then known as the East March.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth p. 57 entry "Buckland". Note also that his dating of FA 42 mirrors the earlier uncorrected date of the Prologue.
Karen Wynn Fonstad also says: Two adjacent areas were added to the Shire: the Eastmarch (Buckland) and...Karen Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 69, The Shire
The semicolon in the above quote, which separates Buckland from Westmarch, was added to show that only "the Westmarch added to the Shire". That is consistent with various other references, such as that the Appendix B mentions the creation of the Westmarch in , but there is no reference to Buckland or an "Eastmarch" under that year.
==Etymology==
The word Wiktionary:buck means "goat" or "deer", and comes from the family name Oldbucks.
Buckland and Little Buckland are real places in England, located just to the south of Evesham.Mark T. Hooker, The Hobbitonian Anthology, pp. 97, 112 The etymology of these towns comes from book (i.e. The Bible), referring to a land that was owned by a church or a written charter., p. 754 There is a Buckland in Wikipedia:Pembrokeshire, Wales in the parish of Llan-sant-ffraid. The gloss for this Welsh Buckland exactly matches Tolkiens instructions in Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings for translating the name Buckland. It means the "land of the deer".Mark T. Hooker, Tolkien and Welsh pp. 18-19
==Inspiration==
Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the Bree-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.
