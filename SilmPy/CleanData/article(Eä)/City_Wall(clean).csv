==History==
The city of Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith) was built after  upon the founding of the realm of Gondor. The City Wall may have been built at this time although it is unknown if the fortress-city had all seven of its levels at its earliest stage.
In the great Battle of the Pelennor Fields, on 15 March  the host of Sauron did not attempt to breach the City Wall; instead they concentrated upon breaking the Great Gate.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On a plan of Minas Tirith, drawn on the back of a typescript page, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote "Othram or City Wall" to the left of the words "Great Gate"., p. 288 Although the phrase "City Wall" was used in The Return of the King, the Sindarin word Othram was not included.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Although the text of The Return of the King states that the outer wall of Minas Tirith was "dark" (see quotation above) in the movie, as in other depictions of the City, the wall is white.
