The Kings House was a building in Osgiliath where the Kings of Gondor of Gondor and their families lived during the first part of the Third Age. After the abandonment of Osgiliath and the removal of the Kings to Minas Tirith in ,, 1640 the Kings House was presumably no longer used.
Queen Ber√∫thiel was said to prefer the Kings House to Tarannon Falasturs residence by the Belegaer near Pelargir. While living there, she kept the inside bare and filled the courtyard with strange and frightening sculptures., Note 7
