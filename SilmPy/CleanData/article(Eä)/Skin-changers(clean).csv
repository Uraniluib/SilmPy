File:Pascal Yung - Skin-changers.jpg - Beorning Skin-changers
Skin-changers were creatures who could take different forms at will. Little is known of their abilities; the only famous skin-changers were Beorn and his Beornings (who could take the shape of a Men or of a bear),, passim but evidently other skin-changers also existed.
It has been suggested that Radagast, a "master of shapes and hues", was able to change his form.http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?t=38698 Radagast: master of shapes and hues Forum discussion
