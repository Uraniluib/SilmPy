Lilies were large flowers that grow on slender stalks.  Given many references to these flowers they must have been widespread in Middle-earth:  In the Shire there were two Hobbits who were named "Lily", Lily Baggins and Lily Cotton.  Among Gandalfs amazing array of fireworks was one in the shape of a lily, which could famously hang in the air throughout an entire evening.  Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee found lilies when they came to Ithilien.  Ã‰owyn, ill in the Houses of Healing, was described as "white as a lily".  Legolas sang of the green fields of Lebennin where "the while lilies sway".
