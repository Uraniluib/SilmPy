 
Meril-i-Turinqi (alt. Meril-i-Túrinqi, p. 72) was the Lady of Tol Eressëa in the The Book of Lost Tales. She was also known as the Lady of the Isle.
Meril was of the line of Ingwë or Inwithiel, being his great-granddaughter, but was also akin to the Solosimpi. Long ago she had seen the Bay of Eldamar. 
Later she dwelt in a white house inside a great korin (a great circular hedge around a green sward) of the most ancient elms, near Ingils tower. She was of great beauty and accompanied by Elves maidens.
Littleheart brought Eriol to her house who requested to taste some limpe, seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves. Turinqi denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a mortal Man, as Ilúvatar made his Children of Ilúvatar different, and drinking limpe would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would at a time long for his lands again. To explain better she told him the story of the Awakening of the Elves and their bliss in Valinor.
