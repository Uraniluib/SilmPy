The First War was a titanic struggle between the Valar and Melkor at the beginning of Arda for its dominion.
== History ==
===Prelude===
When Ainur came to Arda, before it was fully formed and anything dwelt, Melkor claimed it for himself. Manwë denied this and spirits, including Varda, came to his side from the deeps of Ea. 
===The War===
The battles fought for the dominion of Arda were numerous but unnamed and of them the Eldar knew what the Valar told them.
While the Valar formed Arda, Melkor undid or marred whatever they made, demolishing mountains they created, raising up their valleys and spilling their seas, ever hindering their plans. The works of Aulë suffered most, and he grew weary repairing the damage and tumults by Melkor. 
Presumably it was during that War that Ossë and Sauron were ensnared by Melkor.
Melkor prevailed for ages and news of the War reached far in heaven where other spirits remained. Learning of the War, Tulkas finally descended to Arda in Valian Years 1499. Hearing his mighty laughter, Melkor fled before Tulkass anger and escaped beyond the Walls of Night.
===Aftermath===
The result of the War was that Arda Marred. The completion of the world was hindered and its plan was altered. There was peace for a long time and thenceforth Tulkas was counted among the Valar. Tulkas and Aulë labored much to restore Arda and extinguish the fires.
Aulë created the Two Lamps for the illumination of all Arda and the vegetation of Yavanna, who planted her seeds that sprouted. The earth was filled with plants from mosses to large trees in the Spring of Arda. 
Melkor forsook Arda and brooded in the outer darkness for some time, and held a hatred of Tulkas forever after.
Of that primordial duel the Elves knew only what the Powers told them of it.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In Tolkiens latest writings where Arda was a Round World version of the Silmarillion from its beginning, this period of fire and cataclysm is said to correspond roughly with the earths primeval epochs before this world became habitable for organic life. During these battles, it is said, the earth was given its elliptic orbit and the Moon broke away from the earth, both of which were caused by Melkor, though another version tells that the Valar wrought the Moon from the earth to counteract the night when Melkor was most active.
