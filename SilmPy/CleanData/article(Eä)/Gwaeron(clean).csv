Following the tradition of their forerunners the Edain, the Dúnedain of Middle-earth kept a calendar that took its month-names from the Sindarin language. In that calendar, Gwaeron was the third month of the year, with a name equivalent to the more widely used Quenya Súlimë. Both these Elvish names are a reference to the winds of this season of the year.
