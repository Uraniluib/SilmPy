Dale was a city of the Northmen, destroyed by the Dragons Smaug and rebuilt after his demise.
 
==Description==
Dale was situated in the valley between the south-western and south-eastern arms of the Lonely Mountain, nestled in a sharp U-shaped bend of the River Running. It was known as a merry town that traded, mainly in food-supplies, for the skills and craft-pieces of the Dwarves of Erebor. Dales toy market was the wonder of the North and the town was renowned for its bells.
==History==

In  King Thr칩r re-established the Kingdom under the Mountain. The realm prospered and Northmen living to the south came up the River Running and built Dale. The town shared in the prosperity of the Dwarves and it was governed by the Lord of Dale, of whom the last was named Girion.
 
In  Smaug descended upon the Dwarf-kingdom. Although the Men of Dale fielded warriors against the monster they could not prevent him from killing or scattering the Dwarves and then occupying the Lonely Mountain. After the attack the dragon would crawl out of the Front Gate of the Mountain by night and carry away people (especially maidens) from Dale to eat. The remaining population soon fled and the deserted city fell into ruins.
 
The death of Smaug and the Battle of Five Armies occurred in . Three years after the battle, Dale was rebuilt by Bard, who had killed the dragon and was the descendant of Girion. Dale soon again enjoyed prosperity: Bard founded the Kingdom of Dale and it gathered men from the Long Lake, the South, and the West. Lake-town was rebuilt and grew wealthy from traffic with Dale. Its people became known as Bardings, after their new ruler.

During the reign of  King Brand, the grandson of Bard the Bowman, Dale served as the capital for the lands he ruled, which extended far south and east of Lake-town. However, as Gl칩in revealed at the Council of Elrond, in  a messenger from Mordor came to ask King D치in Ironfoot at the gate to the Lonely Mountain for news of Hobbits and to ask for Bilbo Baggins The One Ring. Messengers had also come to King Brand and there were enemies gathering upon the Kingdom of Dales eastern borders.
 
During the War of the Ring, the Easterlings crossed the border and moved to attack the city. On 17 March  the Battle of Dale began. Not able to hold back the Easterlings the Bardings and their allies, the Dwarves of Erebor, retreated into the Lonely Mountain, but lost Kings Brand and D치in Ironfoot who were both slain at the Gate of Erebor. For seven days the Men and Dwarves barricaded themselves in Erebor until news came from the south of the defeat of Sauron. The new kings of Dale and Erebor (Bard II and Thorin Stonehelm), broke the siege and chased the Easterlings out of Dale. After the siege, the Bardings rebuilt Dale, with the help of the Dwarves. Bard also sent an emissary to the coronation of King Aragorn.
==Etymology==
The word dale means "valley", as it was built in the River Running valley between two arms of Erebor.
