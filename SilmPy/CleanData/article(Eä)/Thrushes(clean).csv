Thrushes are large speckled brown birds with a special fondness for snails, whose shells they remove by breaking them against stones.  The thrush that Bilbo Baggins and the Thorin and Company encountered on the Lonely Mountain was unusually large and nearly black with dark spots on its pale yellow breast.  Thorin stated that it was a member of an ancient breed, long lived and magical.
In  the thrush on the Lonely Mountain was instrumental in the downfall of Smaug.  On Thrórs Map, the Moon-letters instructions said to "Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks" on Durins Day to see the magic key-hole.  Sure enough, when Durins Day arrived this thrush knocked a snail on the grey stone in the small rocky alcove on the Mountain, which alerted the company to watch for the appearance of the keyhole and Back Door.
The men of Lake-men and Men of Dale could understand the language of the thrushes, and some thrushes could understand the Westron.  Fortunately the thrush on the Mountain was one of them for he was able to understand Bilbos account of his talk with Smaug and hear about the bare patch on the Dragonss breast.  On the night when Smaug attacked Lake-town the thrush spoke to Bard and revealed the vulnerable part on the monster.  Bard was able to pierce the dragon with his arrow with this knowledge.
After the Dwarves and the Hobbit had escaped from the mountain to Ravenhill the thrush returned with the news of Smaugs demise.  Finding that none could understand his speech, the thrush left and brought back the raven Roäc who could translate the thrushs words.  After this exchange of information the thrush vanished from the scene.
==Inspiration==
In The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún, a raven and a Finches speak two of the verses,, pp. 116-117, 214-215 reminiscent of the sentient thrushes and ravens in The Hobbit.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the earliest version of Thórs Map (called "Fimbulfambis Map" by John D. Rateliff in The History of The Hobbit since that was Thórs original designation) the Moon-letters said to "Stand by the grey stone when the crow knocks…".  This was soon changed to thrush., pp. 22-23
