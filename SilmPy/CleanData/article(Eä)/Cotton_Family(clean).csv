The Cotton family was a working class family of Hobbits.
==Origin==
Cottar, the founder of the Cotton clan, was born some two hundred years before the War of the Ring. It was his grandson, Holman Cotton, who was the first to take the surname Cotton. "Long Hom", as Holman was known, is also the first of the Cottons to be explicitly connected with the village of Bywater, which remained the seat of the family from that time on.
Holmans son Tolman Cotton Senior farmed the lands to the south of Bywater, and it was he who made the family one of the most important in the Shire. He played a significant part in the decisive Battle of Bywater, the most important step in the recovery of the Shire from Sharkeys Men, and his daughter Rose Cotton married Samwise Gamgee in the following spring.

==Etymology==
The name Cotton is a real-life English surname and means "cottage town".J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), "Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings", published in A Tolkien Compass (edited by Jared Lobdell), entry Cotton
Thus the name could represent a possible Old English Cottun "town with cottages".
It is also a translation of the Westron Hlothran, associated with the name Cotman#Etymology. Hlothran was "a fairly common village-name in the Shire", though none is mentioned (or noteworthy enough) on any map.
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien chose to couple the Cottons with the Gamgee Family because of Gamgee cotton (also known as Gamgee tissue), a surgical tissue he heard of as a child. It was invented by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampson_Gamgee J. Sampson Gamgee.
