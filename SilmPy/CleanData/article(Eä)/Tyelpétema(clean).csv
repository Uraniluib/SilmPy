Tyelpetéma was one of the five témar or sound-series of the Tengwar writing system.
The Tyelpetéma appears to have been unique; while each of the other four series consisted of a set of six individual letters, the palatal sounds of the Tyelpetéma were formed by adding a diacritic mark of two dots beneath another character.  This is the equivalent of adding a y after the letter in English to form a single distinct consonant sound.  As an example, the sound ty here has the same sound as the initial consonant in the (British pronunciation of) the English word tune - something close to, but distinct from, ch., Consonants, TY
