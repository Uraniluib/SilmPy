Ezellohar, also called Corollairë, was the Green Mound before the western gates of Valmar, the city of the Valar. After being hallowed by Yavanna and watered by the tears of Nienna, it was the place where the Two Trees of Valinor grew.  Later Morgoth and Ungoliant came to Ezellohar and attacked the Two Trees and Ezellohar was blackened.
==Etymology==
The name Ezellohar (pron. ) is Vanyarin for "Green Mound", containing the element ezel, ezella, ezello ("green")., p. 399, note 9, pp. 356-7 Ezellohar was derived from the Valarin name Ezellôchâr.
Corollairë (pron. ) is a Quenya name, which appears to be a compressed version of Coron Oiolairë or "Mound of Ever-summer" (from coron, "mound", coron and oio, "ever", OY plus lairë, "summer").
