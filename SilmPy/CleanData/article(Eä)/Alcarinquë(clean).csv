Alcarinquë was a name of one of the stars in Arda.
==History==
In the distant past, at the time of the awakening of the Elves, Varda added many brilliant stars to the heavens using the shimmering dews of Telperion the Silver Tree. Among these were the familiar star-patterns we still know today, and other lights that were not truly stars. Among these was Alcarinquë - the planet we know as Wikipedia:Jupiter.
Alcarinquë would likely have been the brightest object in the skies at that time.  When Varda created Alcarinquë and the other new lights the Elves first awoke.  It was not until the Elves had been to Aman and the Noldor were returning to Middle-earth that the Moon and the Sun were created and Venus - the Silmarils of Eärendil - was not placed in the heavens until much later.
==Etymology==
