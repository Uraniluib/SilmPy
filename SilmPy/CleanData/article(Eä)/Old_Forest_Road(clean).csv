The Old Forest Road or Men-i-Naugrim (Sindarin men (Elvish) "road, way" + in "the, who" + Naugrim "dwarves"; "Way of the Dwarves") or simply the Dwarf-road was the main route through the great forest originally known as Mirkwood and latterly as Mirkwood.
==History==
The name Dwarf-road suggests that the road was apparently built or at least used as a trade-route by the Dwarves (who had a tradition of road-building dating back to before the First Age). The location suggests that it carried traffic between the western and eastern clans. The latitude of the road is halfway between the ancient Dwarven meeting-place at Gundabad to the north, and Moria to the south.
Near the end of the Second Age, a stone bridge crossed the Anduin over the only point that it could be crossed, as the waters were slower. This was specially enlarged and strengthened to carry the armies of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. By the latter Third Age no such bridge was mentioned and the river was crossed by the Old Ford., Note 14
Beorn warned Thorin and Company that it was often used by Orcs and inside the forest, the road was overgrown and disused.
==Route==
The road descended from the Pass of Imladris, crossed Anduin, and traversed Mirkwood.
Where the Road crossed the Great River, there was originally a stone bridge, but later it had been lost and the river was crossed by the Old Ford. From there, it crossed some miles of open country before plunging into the depths of the forest Mirkwood. The Road then ran directly east from one side of the forest to the other, covering more than two hundred miles beneath the canopy of trees before it emerged by the banks of the River River Running. At the eastern end it led to impassable Long Marshes where the paths had long been lost.
==Etymology==
Sindarin from men (Sindarin word) "road", i "the" and Naugrim "dwarves".
