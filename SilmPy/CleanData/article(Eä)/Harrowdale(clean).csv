Harrowdale was the name given to the deep north-south valley cut out of the White Mountains by the Snowbourn River. At its southern end, beneath the mountain Starkhorn, stood Dunharrow, an ancient structure of the Oathbreakers, later used as refuge of the Rohirrim. At its northern end, where the Snowbourn issued onto the plains of Rohan, stood Rohans capital, Edoras.
During the War of the Ring the Lord of Harrowdale was Dúnhere. It was there that the muster of Rohan took place before Théoden led his riders to Minas Tirith and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where Théoden and Dúnhere were killed.
