The Messenger Service was the system used in the Shire for its inhabitants to communicate with each other. By this way, along with the Quick Post (which was probably a part of the Service), letters and news was passed between the four Farthings. 
The office of the Mayor of Michel Delving, in his capacity as Postmaster, was responsible for its efficiency.
