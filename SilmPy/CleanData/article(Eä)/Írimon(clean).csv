Írimon was the third child, but only son, of King Tar-Elendil of Númenor. In his youth, Írimon was fascinated by the stars, and he removed to the heights of the northern Forostar, where they were more clearly visible. There he built a watch-tower among the highlands to follow the movements of the heavens. When he succeeded his father as King, he left his star-tower and returned to Armenelos, the chief city of Númenor, where he took the Sceptre in the name of Tar-Meneldur (where Meneldur means devoted to the heavens).
