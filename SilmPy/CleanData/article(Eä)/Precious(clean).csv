"Precious", alternatively "the Precious", "my Precious" or "his Precious", was a name given to the One Ring by various Ring-bearers.  Its use indicated the morbid covetousness induced in holders of the Ring by the Ring itself. 
 
==History==
The very first Ring-bearer (besides Sauron) was the first to apply the term "precious" to the One Ring.  In , Isildur, who had taken the Ring from Sauron, wrote a Scroll of Isildur in which he described what he claimed as an heirloom for the Arnor.  At the end ofthe document he wrote:
 
:But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair.  It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.
 
Centuries later, in , Gollum took possession of the Ring after murdering DÃ©agol.  In , Gollum hid in the Misty Mountains, taking the Ring with him into darkness. When he began calling the Ring his "precious" is unknown, but by  when he met Bilbo Baggins he was referring to "my precious" constantly. It is difficult to distinguish whether Gollum was referring to the Ring or to himself when he used this term, which seems to indicate how much the Ring dominated his mind.
 
On 22 September  Bilbo held his Bilbos Farewell Party.  After vanishing after his speech he returned to Bag End to make his final preparations to depart from the Shire.  When Gandalf urged the old hobbit to leave the Ring for Frodo Baggins, Bilbo became angry.  He announced:
 
:It is mine, I tell you. My own.  My precious.  Yes, my precious.
 
Eventually Gandalf was able to persuade Bilbo to relinquish the Ring, but Bilbos behavior and his use of the word "precious" alarmed the wizard and spurred him to investigate the history of Bilbos magic ring, leading him to Isildurs scroll.
 
In the Cracks of Doom on 15 March  Frodo claimed the Ring for himself and was immediately set upon by Gollum. Gollum won the fight and danced about with the Ring, shouting, "Precious, precious, precious! "  He then slipped and fell into the chasm and the last word he wailed was "precious".
