According to Pengolodh, the sage of Gondolin, the making of a language is the chief character of an Incarnate. The speaking peoples used languages to communicate. The first of those races were the Dwarves who were taught by Aulë and then the Elves, who called themselves Quendi, the "Speakers".
In the history of Arda, the Elvish tongues were separated as part of the peoples emigrating while others stay behind, leading to a split of Quenya (High-Elvish, or Elf-Latin) and Sindarin.
==Linguistic lore==
In Quenya, lambë is the term for spoken language or verbal communiation while tengwesta is a more abstract term for a system or a code of signs and may be translated as "grammar". As Pengolodh noted, "The making of a lambe  is the chief character of an Incarnate," including the Valar., p.397
In Valinor, the Elves began to be interested in the nature of their languages. These loremasters were called lambengolmor. Usually they would compare Quenya proper against Telerin and point out the original Primitive Quendian.
The invention of writing is attributed to Rúmil (elf of Tirion), who first invented an alphabet: the Sarati (literally "letters"). Fëanor later enhanced and further developed this alphabet into the Tengwar, which were spread to Middle-earth by the Noldor and remained in use ever after.
Daeron of Doriath indepently of Rúmil and Fëanor had invented the Cirth Runes, but these were only used for inscriptions, and otherwise replaced by the Tengwar, except among the Dwarves.
An important source of Middle-earth linguistic scholarship is Pengolodh of Gondolin who wrote in Quenya. He is the author of Quendi and Eldar, the Lhammas and Ósanwe-kenta.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tolkiens conceptions of the languages, like his mythology itself, changed through time. For older linguistic concepts see The Tree of Tongues, Oromean, Aulean, Goldogrin, Kornoldorin, Noldorin, Qenya, Ilkorin, Doriathrin, Nandorin and Taliska.
==Inspiration==
}}
Language-making was Tolkiens hobby for most of his life. He is known to have constructed his first languages (Animalic and Nevbosh) at a little over thirteen and he continued to ponder upon his creations up until his death more than sixty-five years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through the English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.
Tolkien was a professional philologist and a specialist in the Old English language. He was also interested in many languages outside his field and developed a particular love for the Finnish language (he described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as "entering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before".
Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkiens favorites was Welsh &mdash; and features of Welsh phonology found their way to Sindarin. Numerous words were borrowed from existing languages, but less and less obviously as Tolkien progressed. Words that are an exact match with existing Welsh words can be found in the early drafts of Tolkien’s manuscripts published as The History of Middle-earth,Mark T. Hooker, Tolkien and Welsh, p. viii but attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.
In discussing the languages J.R.R. Tolkien invented, it is necessary to consider two aspects: their "primary world" history, namely their literal development by Tolkien as a linguist, and their "secondary world" history, namely their imagined historical development in the history of Middle-earth.
Although the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya are the most famous and the most mature languages of those that Tolkien invented for his mythology, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish dialects, that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common to all Eldar, which in turn originates in Primitive Quendian, the common root of Eldarin and Avarin languages. In addition to that, there is a separate language family that is spoken by Men, the most prominent member of which was Westron (derived from the Númenóreans speech Adûnaic) or the "Common speech" of the peoples of The Lord of the Rings. Most Mannish tongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some Dwarvish influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, for example the Khuzdul language of the Dwarves. Other languages are Valarin (the tongue of the Valar), and the Black Speech created by Sauron during the Second Age.
==Elvish scholarship==
 
Although the study of Tolkiens languages is as a rule not taken seriously by mainstream linguistics, a number of serious scholars have worked on compiling all that can be recovered about their histories and grammars.
 
An early book dedicated to Tolkiens languages is An Introduction to Elvish by Jim Allan (published by Brans Head Books), written before the publication of The Silmarillion in 1977 and therefore mostly outdated.
There are several journals dedicated to the subject:
*Quettar, Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, edited by Julian C. Bradfield, the oldest Eldarin publication.
*Vinyar Tengwar and Parma Eldalamberon are published by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship. 
*Tyalie Tyelellieva is published by Lisa Star. 
*Mythlore is published by the Mythopoeic Society. 
*Beyond Bree is published by Nancy Martsch. 
Tolklang, Elfling and Lambengolmor are mailing lists dedicated to Tolkien linguistics.
