The Wold was the northernmost and least populated part of Rohan, a grassy upland plain lying between Fangorn Forest and the Anduin, bordered to the north by the Limlight.
==History==
Prior to the late years of the Second Age the Wold was part of no kingdom; the Elves of Lothlórien never claimed any land south of the Limlight as part of their realm. When the kingdom of Gondor was established in , the Wold became part of Calenardhon.
After victory in the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur, his nephew Meneldil, and a company of trusted friends rode about the borders of Gondor. The Wold was one of their last stops before they journeyed to Amon Anwar where the tomb of Elendil was made., (iv) The Tradition of Isildur
In  the Wold was invaded by a host of the Balchoth who crossed over the Anduin from the Brown Lands. At the same time Orcs descended upon the Wold from the Misty Mountains in the west. The Ruling Steward Cirion sent messengers north to seek aid and then led Gondors northern army to repel the invaders. This army had been driven into the Field of Celebrant and was facing annihilation when Eorl and his mounted host burst upon the rear of the enemy. The invaders fled across the Limlight and were hunted by Eorls riders across the Wold.

It was after that victory when Calenardhon, including the Wold, was given to Eorls people and became an independent kingdom. However, in  Easterlings once more attempted to invade the area and King Eorl of the Rohirrim fell in battle in the Wold.
The main inhabitants were nomadic Men of Rohan who used the land to graze cattle, although during the years up to the War of the Ring the land had become deserted due to Orcs.
In July  the Nazgûl passed northward across the Wold as they began searching for the land of the Hobbits. They returned to the Wold in September empty-handed, where they met messengers from Sauron with orders to ride in haste to Isengard., (i) On the Journey of the Black Riders according to the account that Gandalf gave to Frodo
In February  the Fellowship of the Ring passed by the eastern edge of the Wold as they coursed down the Anduin. Later that month the Fellowship was broken and first the Uruk-hai, who had captured Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, followed by the Three Hunters, skirted the western edge of the Wold as they raced towards Fangorn Forest. It was here that Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli met Éomer, who was riding back after destroying the Orcs who had crossed the northern plains of Rohan.
The Wold was invaded from the north by forces from Dol Guldur on 11 March, . These invaders were destroyed upon the Wold by the Ents on 12 March.
