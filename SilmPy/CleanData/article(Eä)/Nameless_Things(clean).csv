Nameless Things  were creatures that are said to have dwelled in the depths of Arda (though they are only known to have lived under the Misty Mountains). They tunnelled deeper than any Dwarves would ever go. 
They were described by Gandalf as very ancient, but their actual origin is unknown. Their nature or appearance are a mystery, but since they are as old as the world, they must have been a part of the Music of the Ainur or (since Sauron knew them not), a by-product of it.
The Balrogs known as Durins Bane learned their tunnels while living in the depths of Moria. After Gandalf fell with him in the abyss, Durins Bane seemed to know his way up and found the Endless Stair. He was Gandalfs only hope and he followed him.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
