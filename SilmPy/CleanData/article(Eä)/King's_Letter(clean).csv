The Kings Letter was a letter sent by King Aragorn, to be published in an epilogue to The Lord of the Rings, but this idea was dropped. It is the longest known sample of both Sindarin prose and Tengwar. 
==Position in the story==
The omitted epilogue was finally published in Sauron Defeated, and tells the story of Samwise Gamgee and his children in the year 16 of the Fourth Age. At this time, only eight of Sams thirteen children are born, Daisy Gardner being the youngest. 
One night, Sam gathers his children around the fire to tell them of a letter he received, from King Elessar far away. It was black, the letters were golden, and it was wrapped in silk. In the letter, Elessar greets Samwise and his children, and tells them he will ride to the Fornost Erain. He would meet all those interested on the Brandywine Bridge. He would not enter the Shire, as he himself banned Men from entering the Hobbits land.  
==Versions==
Three versions of the actual letter exist. The first and third were published with the epilogue in Sauron Defeated. The second version was first published as the cover image of Vinyar Tengwar 29, and later reproduced as image 199 in J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator. 
===First version===
The first version is written in a vowel-mode which employs tengwar for vowels, like the Mode of Beleriand. The text goes:
{||-|Aragorn Strider The Elfstone, King of Gondor and Lord of the Westlands, will approach the Bridge of Baranduin on the eighth day of Spring, or in the Shire-reckoning the second day of April. And he desires to greet there all his friends. In especial he desires to see Maser Samwise, Mayor of the Shire, and Rose his wife; and Elanor, Rose, Goldilocks, and Daisy his daughters; and Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Hamfast his sons.
:To Samwise and Rose the Kings greeting from Minas Tirith, the thirty-first day of the Stirring, being the twenty-third of February in their reckoning.A•E•|Elessar Telcontar: Aragorn Arathornion Edhelharn, aran Gondor ar Hîr i Mbair Annui, anglennatha i Varanduiniant erin dolothen Ethuil, egor ben genediad Drannail erin Gwirith edwen. Ar e aníra ennas suilannad mhellyn în phain: edregol e aníra tírad i Cherdir Perhael (i sennui Panthael estathar aen) Condir i Drann, ar Meril bess dîn, ar Elanor, Meril, Glorfinniel, ar Eirien sellath dîn; ar Iorhael, Gelir, Cordof, ar Baravorn, ionnath dîn. 
:A Pherhael ar am Meril suilad uin aran o Minas Tirith nelchaenen uin Echuir.A•E•|}
The translation misses one line: (i sennui Panthael estathar aen). This translates as "who ought to be called Fullwise", referring to Samwises name, meaning "Halfwise". 
===Second Version===
This second version polishes up some minor mistakes and corrections in the first, but omits the date and place of the letter, and ar Arnor has been added after the first Gondor. It is also written in the vowel mode.
===Third Version===
This version, included in a second sketch of the epilogue, uses vowel-tehtar instead of the vowel-tengwar of the previous mode. The text itself is slightly different from the second version. The word order of the first sentence is changed, and in the postscript, the year is added: 1436 of the Shire Reckoning in the English version, and 16 in the Stewards Reckoning. The signature, which could not exist of two vowels in this mode, is written Ar•El•
==Significance==
===Tengwar===
These texts are the longest known examples of Sindarin Tengwar, and added several symbols to the alphabet. Commas, colons, brackets and periods were previously unknown, and the third letter contained information on numerals. 
The letter also provided the correct tengwar for diphtongs. These are as following:
* AE: written as  yanta + /a/-tehtar
* AI: written as  anna + /a/-tehta
* EI: written as  anna + /e/-tehta
* IE: written as  /i/-short carrier amd the /e/ on top of the following consonant
* UI: written as  anna + u-tehta
Though numerals were already published in Quettar (1982#February), the Letter employs a quite different shape for the charactersReconstructed and analyzed http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_kl_num.html here by Per Lindberg. We also see 
the order of the numerals - right to left. So 1436 and 16 appear as 6341 and 61 here.
===Sindarin===
These texts show the use of various formation unknown prior to publication, such as the use of the gerund after another verb, word order, passive sentences, and various names. 
The following Sindarin names appear in the versions of this letter:
* Aragorn
* Arathornion, "Arathornsson"
* Edhelharn, "Elessar, Elfstone"
* Perhael, "Samwise", though this had already appeared in the Ringbearers Praise in the chapter The Field of Cormallen.
* Panthael, "Fullwise"
* Meril, "Rose". This name was used in early writings for the lady of Tol Eressëa, Meril-i-Turinqi.
* Glorfinniel, "Goldilocks"
* Eirien, "Daisy", reminiscient of Arien.
* Iorhael, "Frodo". In the Ringbearers Praise, Frodo Baggins was called Taur (lenited Daur) instead.
* Gelir, "Merry"
* Cordof, "Pippin"
* Baravorn, "Hamfast"
* i Drann, "The Shire"
* i Varanduiniant, "Brandywine Bridge"
==Calendar==
The dating system of the letter is not described in the Appendices but can be found in the The Peoples of Middle-earth. It is a system where "dates were usually given in official documents by the Seasons, but the old month-names ... remained in private and popular use."
The "thirty-first day of Stirring" (echuir) of 16 N.R. represents 23 February of ; the "eighth day of Spring" (ethuil) 17 N.R. represents 2 April .
1 N.R. =  =  (not  as Christopher Tolkien suggests in a footnote). 
Note that this corresponds to the abandoned calendaric system displayed in The Peoples of Middle-earth which was abandoned and contradicts that of the Appendices where 31 echuir should represent 24 February.Andreas Moehn http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Time.html The Reckoning of Time
