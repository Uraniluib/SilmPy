:  He carries many weapons, such as throwing axes, war hammers, knives and swords. Daniel Falconer. http://www.wetanz.com/chronicles-cloaks-and-daggers-signed/ The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Chronicles: Cloaks and Daggers. p.95.  When Thorin refuses to allow Kíli to go with the others to the Lonely Mountain due to his weakened state (from being struck by a poisoned arrow), Fíli opts to stay behind in Lake-town (along with de facto group healer Óin) and look after his younger brother. In the Battle of Five Armies, he goes to assist Thorin (along with Kíli and Dwalin) at the top of Ravenhill in an attempt to kill the Orcs armys leader, Azog. However, when searching for the Pale Orc, Fíli is cornered by him and some of his soldiers. Azog then takes Fíli out in front of the other Dwarves, impales him with the sword attached to his left arm, and drops his body onto the rock below him as the others watch in horror.
