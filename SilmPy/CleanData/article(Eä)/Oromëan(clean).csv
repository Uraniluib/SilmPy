In an older version of J.R.R. Tolkiens conception of the Languages of Middle-earth as expounded in the Lhammas, Oromëan is the language phylum to which all Elvish languages, such as Qenya, Kornoldorin and Ilkorin, belong. It is there contrasted with Aulëan, the language phylum of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves.
The Oromëan languages are so named because their ancestral language supposedly derives from the speech of Oromë, the Valar of the Forest, who was the first of the Valar to meet the Elves at Cuiviénen in Middle-earth.
This concept was later dropped and it is mentioned that when Oromë found the Elves they already had  devised by themselves Primitive Elvish.
