In earlier stages of the Legendarium, Fëanors sons had different slightly different names. Amrod used to be called Damrod., pp. 241, 251
In the published The Silmarillion, he lived south of Lothlann, southeast of Himlad, southwest of Thargelion, and east of Doriath in the wide-plains of East Beleriand and ruled with his twin Amras over those lands west of the Blue Mountains and the River Gelion.
There is no trace of the death of Amrod at Losgar in the published The Silmarillion, as it was a very late idea by J.R.R. Tolkien that did not develop beyond an inked draft before it was abandoned. Although there is a brief margin note referring to the tale, that one of Fëanors youngest sons died aboard a burning ship at Losgar, in the Annals of Aman, the "strange and sinister" incomplete draft material, which separated the twins very early in their tale was omitted by Christopher Tolkien. In The Silmarillion, Amrods life and death happen alongside his brothers and not as an individual role.
