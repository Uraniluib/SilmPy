:This article is about the constellation. For the king of Gondor, see Telumehtar Umbardacil.
Telumehtar (Quenya "Warrior of the Sky") is another name of the constellation Menelmacar. It is known in our world as Wikipedia:Orion.
Behind this name lies an early story about a Valar named Telimektar, son of Tulkas, who apparently was converted into the constellation of Orion. Apart from the story of Telimektar there are two mentions of Telumehtar the Constellation:
# The name is quoted as an example of the pronunciation of the consonant /H/ with a reference to Orion, explained in a footnote: "usually called in Sindarin Menelvagor, --- Quenya Menelmacar". (entry concerning the pronounciation of H)
# With the translation "Warrior of the Sky", as an older name for Menelmakil, Orion. (Note 15, p. 411)
