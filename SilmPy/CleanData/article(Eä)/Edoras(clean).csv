Edoras was the capital of Rohan that held the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
==History==
Rohans first capital was at Aldburg in the Folde, until Rulers of Rohan Eorl the Young or his son Brego built Edoras. 
Wulf son of Freca the Dunlending, invaded Rohan in  and took Edoras usurping the throne in Meduseld.  But the Long Winter, which had lasted five long months, ended and Fréaláf son of Hild came out of Dunharrow and with a small band of men, surprising Wulf, he attacked Edoras and slew Wulf, regaining the city.
It was here that Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf the White met with Théoden.
==Geography==
The city was built on a hill in Harrowdale, a valley of the White Mountains which lay under the great mountain Starkhorn. The river Snowbourn flowed past Edoras on its way west towards the Entwash.
Edoras was encircled by a wall, and a dike dug around the hill. It had a spring whose water flowed in a channel along the main road.
Outside, there was the Barrowfield, with the tombs of the Kings of Rohan arrayed in two lines by the War of the Ring. Simbelmynë grew there. A rutted road led from the city past Snowbourn.
