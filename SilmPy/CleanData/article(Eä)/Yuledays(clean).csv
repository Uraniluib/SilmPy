The Yuledays were the two days of the Shire Calendar that marked the end of one year and the beginning of the next. They fell outside the formal months of the calendar, coming after the month of Foreyule and being followed in turn, naturally enough, by the month of Afteryule.
They formed the centre of the six-day Yuletide festival (29 December to 2 January) celebrated not only in the Shire, but also by other northern cultures of Middle-earth.
