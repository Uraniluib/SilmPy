==Other uses==
The Quenya terms were technically Eldandil ("Devoted to the Eldar"), or Quendil ("Devoted to the Quendi") or Elesser. 
Among the Edain and Dúnedain, the Elvish words for "Elf" and "stars" were often confused, since they sounded similar. Thus Elendil or Elvellon was used by them to mean "Elf-friend", though it actually signifies "Devoted to the Stars". 
The plural form Elendili was one of the names for the Faithful Númenóreans.
==Inspiration==
The concept of the "Elf-friend" is recurrent in Tolkiens legendarium, both in meaning and in name. The name http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ælfwine Ælfwine/Elfwine is an actual Old English personal name that means "Elf-friend" and has survived in modern times as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alboin_%28disambiguation%29 Alboin or Alwin/Elwin. This word has been the basis for several characters and terms:
* Elendil
* Nimruzîr 
* Elvellon
* Elfwine son of Éomer
* Ælfwine of England (also known as Eriol)
* Alwin Lowdham
