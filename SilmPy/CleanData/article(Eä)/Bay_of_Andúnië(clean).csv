The northernmost of the three bays that ran along the western coasts of the Andustar in Númenor. The greatest of the three, its shores were no more than a narrow shelf of land from which steep cliffs rose up. Beneath these cliffs at its eastern end was the famous haven of Andúnië. There are suggestions that there may have been a second haven on this bay, too, named Almaida.
