Fanuidhol was one of the three peaks in the Misty Mountains (with Caradhras and Celebdil) that lay above the ancient dwarf-city of Moria.
A short name used by the Dwarves was Shath没r - in full Bundushath没r. It has the same meaning in Khuzdul as Fanuidhol in Sindarin -  they both mean Cloudyhead.
==Etymology==
In the common tongue, Fanuidhol was called Cloudyhead. Both Bundushath没r and Fanuidhol translate to this.
Bundushath没r is Khuzdul - the first element "bund" means "head".
Fanuidhol is  Sindarin, where the second element "dol" means "head".
