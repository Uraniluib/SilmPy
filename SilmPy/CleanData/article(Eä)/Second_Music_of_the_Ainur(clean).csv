The Second Music of the Ainur is the great music the Ainur will make together with the Children of Ilúvatar before Ilúvatar after the End. The Time of Arda is but a learning process towards it.
It will be more splendid than the first Music of the Ainur as the Children will participate, and every participant will fully understand their intent in their part and be in harmony with the others. Ilúvatar will give to them the Secret Fire and his themes shall take Being at the same time they are uttered.
