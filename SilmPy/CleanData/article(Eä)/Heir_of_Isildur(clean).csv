Heir of Isildur was the title of thirty-nine lords of the Dúnedain descended in right line from Isildur the son of Elendil, from his son Valandil (King of Arnor) to Aragorn, who Reunited Kingdom of the Dúnedain in Middle-earth.
Isildur was the eldest son of Elendil, and so by right he and his heirs should have inherited the title of High King of the Dúnedain and ruled the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. Soon after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, though, Isildur and his three elder sons all perished in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.
Isildurs only remaining Heir was Valandil (King of Arnor), kept safe in Rivendell but only eleven years old at that time, and unable to take up his rule. So, Isildurs nephew Meneldil took control of the kingdom of Gondor, and the Two Kingdoms split from one another. In the south, Gondor remained strong under the rule of Meneldils descendants, but the Arnor was not so fortunate. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and was slowly overcome by dark forces of the neighbouring land of Angmar. 
Arvedui, Isildurs Heir through twenty-three generations, was the last King to rule in the north; he was also notable for marrying Fíriel, daughter of the Kings of Gondor Ondoher, thus uniting the House of Isildur and House of Anárion. He later attempted to reclaim the High King of the Dúnedain, but failed, and the last remnant of royal Arnor was overrun by its enemies.
Though their royal cities were wasted, and their people dwindled, the line of Isildurs Heirs continued for another sixteen generations under the title Chieftains of the Dúnedain, who were Arveduis descendants and ruled the remnants of the Dúnedain of Arnor. When the line of the Kings of Gondor also failed and the Ruling Steward ruled the Kingdom, it was the Chieftains who held the line of Anárion alive, but they were hidden in the north, forgotten by nearly all.
The last Chieftain was Aragorn of the War of the Ring, who famously came to Minas Tirith and reclaimed the High Kingship of all the western lands as the Reunited Kingdom.
