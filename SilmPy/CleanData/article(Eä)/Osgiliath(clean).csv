Osgiliath (Sindarin, pron. ) was the old capital city of Gondor. The city straddled the Anduin River at a point approximately half way between the cities of Minas Anor to the south-west and Minas Ithil to the north-east, and north of the nearby Emyn Arnen.
In the Great Hall of the city the thrones of the sons of Elendil were set side by side. In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the Dome of Stars, which housed the Osgiliath-stone, the greatest of the seven Palantíri.
==History==
Founded by Isildur and Anárion near the end of the Second Age, Osgiliath was designated the capital of the southern Númenórean kingdom in exile, Gondor. Soon after its founding, Sauron attacked and took Minas Ithil in  and then moved westward. While Isildur sought aid from the north, Anárions defense of Osgiliath. When the army of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men arrived and later defeated Sauron the threat to the city was lifted. Thereafter, for over a thousand years, Osgiliath was the capital of Gondor, as well as its largest and most important city.

The beginning of the citys decline came in  when it was sacked and burned, after Siege of Osgiliath by the rebel Castamir forces during the Kin-strife. It was during this siege that the Osgiliath-stone was lost in the River. The Great Plague of  led to further depopulation with many victims, and those who fled never returned. The city began to fall into ruin; the capital was moved to the more secure Minas Anor in .
Over the next few hundred years, Gondor endured many military defeats east of the Anduin, especially the fall of Minas Ithil in . Osgiliath became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Osgiliath was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being Uruk-hai attack on Osgiliath temporarily by Uruk-hai in  until it was liberated by Steward Boromir (Steward of Gondor).
Over the following centuries, the western part of the ruined city was under the control of Gondor, and was at times provided with a military garrison as a means of defending the crossing of the Anduin. The eastern part, with Ithilien, was disputed territory, under Gondors control for most of the rule of Denethor, but in June of  it was Saurons attack on Osgiliath by Sauron forces and its last bridge fell. This attack some later considered the beginning of the War of the Ring.

In the following March, well into the War, Sauron launched a full-scale invasion of Gondor west of the Anduin, and despite the Rangers of Ithilien Faramirs defense of Osgiliath, Osgiliath quickly fell to Saurons forces, but it was reclaimed by Gondor after Saurons ultimate defeat a few weeks later.
After the War, Osgiliath was apparently rebuilt, but it never became as great as it once was. Minas Tirith remained the capital and Kings city.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name Osgiliath, "Citadel of the Stars", consists of the elements ost ("fort, citadel") + giliath ("hosts of stars")., p. 232 (citing from the Unfinished index), p. 73

File:War in Middle Earth - Osgiliath.png
Because the city was not visited in the books, it did not appear in many adaptations.
1988: J.R.R. Tolkiens War in Middle Earth:
:Osgiliath is one of the many maps of this game. The maps shows the bridge but the city itself is not shown.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:After capturing Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, Faramir takes them to Osgiliath, in the hope of harnessing the power of The One Ring to the betterment of Gondor. Osgiliath is fully ruined, and partly flooded. After being attacked by several fell beasts, Faramir releases them.
:In a scene in the The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition), Faramir has a flashback. Boromir reclaims the city for Gondor, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Boromir, Faramir and Denethor.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
: Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul) and his orcs finally breach the defences of the Gondorian troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. Madril is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to Minas Tirith, they are beset by the Nazgûl, only to be saved by Gandalf.
:Not impressed by Faramirs deeds, and more upset about the loss of Osgiliath, Denethor sends his son back to Osgiliath, but his company is slaughtered, and Faramir badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the Causeway Forts in the book.
