The Hornburg (originally Súthburg) was a great Gondorian fortress later used by the Rohirrim.
It was said among the Rohirrim that "no enemy has yet taken the Hornburg", and it was considered the strongest point in Rohan, stronger than Edoras and Dunharrow.
==Geography==
The fortress was built in the western Calenardhon on Hornrock that was connected to the Deeping Wall. It guarded Helms Deep nestled in the northeastern White Mountains below the Thrihyrne.
==History==
It was built by Gondorians in the days of the glory of Gondor.
In later years whole regions of Gondor, such as Calenardhon, were depopulated or evacuated. Therefore it came into the possession of Rohan and the master of Westfold dwelt there.
During the Dunlendings occupation and Wulfs usurpation, Helm sought refuge there during the Long Winter. It was renamed Hornburg because a horn shouted from its tower, could be heard in the whole Deep.
During the War of the Ring it was commanded by Gamling the Old, and defended off a large-scale attack from Isengard during the Battle of the Hornburg.
