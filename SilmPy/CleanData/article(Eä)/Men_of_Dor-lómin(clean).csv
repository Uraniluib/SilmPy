The Men of Dor-lómin were Men of the House of Hador, to whom the land of Dor-lómin was granted as a hereditary fief by the Kings of the Noldor. They were ruled by the Lord of Dor-lómin. 
In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad the Men of Dor-lómin formed a host, led by the brothers Húrin and Huor, that assembled on the right of the Noldor of Hithlum.  When the forces of King Turgon retreated, the Men of Dor-lómin served as their rearguard.  When they were pushed back into the Fen of Serech they made a last stand. Afterwards, their lands were given to the Easterlings (First Age), and enslaved by them.
