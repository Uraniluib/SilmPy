File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Bilbos contract tengwar.jpg
Thorins letter, commonly referred to as Bilbos contractA term apparently not occuring in J.R.R. Tolkiens works, but often used by fans and scholars., was a note from Thorin and Company to Bilbo Baggins.
==History==
Thorin Oakenshield wrote the message after the unexpected party in  and left it on Bilbos mantelpiece just under the clock.  The next morning, having not dusted the mantelpiece, Bilbo did not see the letter until Gandalf walked in and pointed it out.  
The letter began with a greeting to "Burglar Bilbo" and thanks for his hospitality and offer to help.  A short list of contract terms were then laid out, promising Bilbo one fourteenth of the profits (if any), with travelling and funeral expenses covered.  The letter then explained that the Thorin and Company had gone ahead to make preparations and that Bilbo was expected at the Green Dragon Inn in Bywater at eleven.  A final sentence emphasized that Thorin expected him to arrive on time.
By the time the hobbit had finished reading the note he had, as the wizard remarked, just ten minutes to get from Bag End to the Green Dragon in order to be on-time for the start of the quest to the Lonely Mountain.  Bilbo ran as fast as he could and made it on the stroke of eleven.
Eventually Bilbo brought out Thorins letter in the camp of the Thranduil and Bard in the valley before the Lonely Mountain.  Bilbo had kept the crumpled and much folded missive in his jacket pocket throughout his adventures and used it to explain his interest in the matters at hand.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the manuscript for The Hobbit Thorins letter (referred to as "Bilbos contract" by John D. Rateliff) was the same as the one published, with the exception that the rendezvous point was the Old Mill.  However, J.R.R. Tolkien also produced a handwritten version of the letter in tengwar, mentioned in his Letter 25 in February 1938, which proved to be too difficult to reproduce for publication. It was finally included, with a transcript by Taum Santoski, in Rateliffs The History of The Hobbit as the frontispiece to Part Two: Return to Bag-End. The Tengwar text was semi-phonetical., pp. 105-7
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Unlike Tolkiens version, where Bilbo gets the message first after the departure of the dwarves, Peter Jacksons film version makes Bilbo receive the contract directly from Thorin and Company while still at Bag End. Furthermore, the contract is much longer in the film version than in The Hobbit. Weta Workshop has released a  replica of Bilbos contract as portrayed in the film, hand made by Daniel Reeve.
