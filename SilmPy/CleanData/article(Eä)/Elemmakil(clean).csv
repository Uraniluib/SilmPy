Elemmakil, one of the Noldor, was the Captain of the Guard in the secret passageway to Gondolin when Tuor and Voronwë appeared.  Elemmakil was amazed that his friend Voronwë would bring a mortal man with him and announced that he should, by law, slay him.  Voronwë and Tuor answered that they came at the command of Ulmo.  Elemmakil then guided the two through the Seven Gates of the Orfalch Echor, until he delivered them unto Ecthelion, then serving as the Warden of the Great Gate.
