The Lithedays or just The Lithe refers to the three (sometimes four) feast days between the months of Forelithe and Afterlithe of the Shire Calendar; in purpose and function the Lithedays were equivalent to the enderi of the Reckoning of Rivendell. 
They were:
*1 Lithe (midsummer-eve)
*Mid-years Day 
**Overlithe (observed only in leap-years)
*2 Lithe
They were called Summerdays in Bree.
Events that occurred on 1 Lithe:
* :
** Elrond discovers the moon-letters on Thrórs Map.
* :
**Arwen comes to Minas Tirith.
Each midsummer-eve the Gerontius Took held parties, where Gandalf impressed the hobbits with fireworks.
