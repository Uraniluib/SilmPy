Trewsday (archaic form Trewesdei) was the fourth day of the week in the Shire Calendar. It represented the Númenórean day Orgaladh, originally dedicated to the tree Nimloth of Númenor.
After the reform of Isengrim Took II, dates such as 1 February and 1 August always fell on Trewsday.
==Etymology==
