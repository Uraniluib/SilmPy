Arcastar (pron. ) is the Quenya rendition of the surname J.R.R. Tolkien (German Tollkühn "foolhardy, reckless, desperately brave, rushbold").
J.R.R. Tolkien signed as Arcastar Mondósaresse "Tolkien in Oxford" in a 1968 letter to the producer of the BBC documentary Tolkien in Oxford.
The exact meaning of Arcastar is unknown. Ryszard Derdzinski has suggested that arcastar could possibly mean "translator" (or "one who carries across"), based on his research about the Tolkien Family name.
