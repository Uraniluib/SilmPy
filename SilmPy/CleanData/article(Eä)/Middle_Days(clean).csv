The Middle Days were those that succeeded the Elder Days in Middle-earth. With the Elder Days being the years of the world before the end of the First Age, the Middle Days were therefore the Second Age and Third Age Ages of the world. The Middle Days would be succeeded by the Younger Days, marked by the Dominion of Men.
