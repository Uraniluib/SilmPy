Ulmos warning was a message given by the Valar Ulmo to Tuor, who was in turn to deliver it to Turgon, King of Gondolin.  In the earlier writings (i.e., The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)) it requested that Turgon sally forth to meet Morgoth in open battle, for the Valar would grant them victory.  In later writings (i.e., The Silmarillion), it was the advice that the doom of Gondolin was coming, suggesting that they seek to find a way to the Blessed Realm.  Either way, Turgon did not heed this wise counsel, because of his pride and the love of his beautiful city.
