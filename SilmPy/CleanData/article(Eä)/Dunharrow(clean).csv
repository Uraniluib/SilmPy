Dunharrow was a refuge of the Rohirrim hidden in the White Mountains south of Edoras and fortified against attack. Dunharrow was a clifftop overlooking Harrowdale, the valley of the river Snowbourn. 
In order to reach the refuge, a winding path had to be used, known as the Stair of the Hold leading to the "Firienfeld", a large grassy area for the encampment of soldiers and refuge-seekers.
Large carved stones marked the entrance to the Dimholt, a natural amphitheatre, which led into the Paths of the Dead.
==History==
Dunharrow had been used as a refuge sacred place by the Pre-Númenóreans Middle Men Oathbreakers during the Second Age &mdash; nearly three millennia before the establishment of the Kingdom of Rohan.
Those Men of the White Mountains had lined the winding path with statues known as the Púkel-men &mdash; statues originally carved in the likeness of the Drúedain.
When the Rohirrim came to the region, they recognised the "heathen fane" and they used it as a refuge.
When Rohan was invaded by the Dunlendings in  some Rohirrim, including Fréaláf, took refuge in Dunharrow during the Long Winter of ; Fréaláf led a daring surprise raid from Dunharrow against the Dunlendings in spring, that recaptured Edoras. 
Some Orcs who fled the War of the Dwarves and Orcs tried to traverse Rohan and reach the White Mountains. Those invaders were hunted down by Brytta Léofa. However some were seen still lingering in Dunharrow, where King Walda was killed by an Orc in .
Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and the Grey Company arrived at Dunharrow on 7 March  and then left at dawn the next day to take the Paths of the Dead.  Théoden and his riders (with Meriadoc Brandybuck) came to Dunharrow on 9 March and rode out for Gondor on 10 March.
== Etymology ==
Tolkien made Dunharrow the Modern English form of Rohirric (Old English) Dúnharg (or Dūnhaerg), meaning "the heathen fane on the hillside"., Note
J.R.R. Tolkien notes that he modernised the element haerg since harrow exists as an element in English place-names., pp. 769
