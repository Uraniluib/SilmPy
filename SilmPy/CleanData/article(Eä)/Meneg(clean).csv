__NOTOC__
meneg means "thousand" in Sindarin. 
==Etymology==
Possibly from OS *meneke (root MENEK)
==Example==
*Menegroth "Thousand Caves"
==Note==
It is not clear if the word refers to proverbial thousand, as in "a great number", or to the exact number 1,000.
If it is the latter, we can suppose that if the word refers to the duodecimal system of the Elves, their 1,000 is rather 1728 (144 X 12).
