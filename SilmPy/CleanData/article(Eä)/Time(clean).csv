Time is the life of Eä. The Timeless Halls and the Void are implied to be outside Time. The Time began with Eä and the Valar descending to Arda. Time perhaps represents the sequence of the chords sung by Eru in the Ainulindalë., entry "Time"
The Count of Time begun with the Two Trees (see: Years of the Trees).
The expression Deeps of Time probably loosely refers to the vast extent of Time, entry "Deeps of Time" in the unfathomable past or future, and each specific point is a finite space in the Deeps of Time.
