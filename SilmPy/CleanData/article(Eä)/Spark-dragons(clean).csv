Spark-dragons were a breed of dragons of whom all that is known is from the nomenclature by the Eldar., p. 370 (entry for LOK-); cf. entry PHAY-, p. 381 No story tells of their appearance in the history of Arda, but one can assume that somehow they radiated light (and therefore perhaps were related to, or were another name for, the great glow-worms).
==Names and Etymology==
In Quenya, the name of the creature is fealóke, consisting of fea ("spark"; from Sundocarme PHAY-, "radiate, send out rays of light") and lóke ("dragon"; from root LOK-, "great serpent, dragon").
==Portrayal in adaptations==
