__NOTOC__
-ma is a Quenya nominal (concretizing) ending denoting a thing (usually object) having something to do with the root meaning; either having its properties or being produced by the verbal action in question; or even being a tool used to accomplish it.
In general, -ma seems to be stuck to naked roots or stems to produce the nouns. Eg. RIL > rilma "glittering light"; verb stems par- "to learn" > parma "book". However, full nouns can also be suffixed with -ma to produce another object: Eg. líco "wax" > lícuma "candle".
==Etymology==
-ma derives from Primitive Quendian -mâ frequent in the names of implements. p.416 Such PQ nouns have yielded Quenya -ma nouns, for example tuimâ > tuima or sjalmâ > hyalma.
In some phonological environments, -ma appears in allomorphs in later Quenya: Nouns in -wa or -ba might conceal a primitive -mâ. For example PQ labmâ > Q lamba (metathesis of bm to mb) or PQ takmâ > Q tangwa (nasalization and strengthening of k before m and velarization of m).Helge Fauskanger, Vicente Velasco (ed.) http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution from Primitive Elvish to Quenya
It is obviously related to similar endings like -mo (which indicates a person or doer) or -me (which form a more abstract noun) which behave and operate similarly. For example alma "wealth" vs alme "blessing", carma "tool" vs carme "art".

==Other possible examples==
Many Quenya nouns might end in -ma however that does not indicate the existence of a suffixed -ma proper ending. For example, the word ráma derives from a root RAM, entry RAM. Therefore it is not analyzed as **rá-ma but as rám-a.
There are other nouns of such ambiguous etymology, as for example lamma "sound" from root LAM. It could be analyzed as LAM + -ma but also the double mm might simply be the result of antoryame (q.v.) of the radical consonant LAM.
Nouns of ambiguous or unknown etymology that might contain -ma are:
cauma "protection", emma "picture", erma "physical mater, farma, lamma "sound", namma "claw, talon", orma "physical matter", querma "spinning wheel", síma "mind, imagination", solma (also sól) "helmet", súma "hollow cavity"
==Cognates==
Because of lenition and apocope of final vowels, all endings -ma, -me and -mo have been reduced to a final -v in Sindarin which doesnt seem to work as a productive suffix. In some cases it even has disappeared according to the phonological environment. For example Q. tengwa > S. têw
