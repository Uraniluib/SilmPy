__NOTOC__
UK is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "nasty"., p. 25 Patrick H. Wynne notes that the root is "apparently an Wikipedia:Onomatopoeia stem" and that it is "probably related to the root UG dislike (whence Q. úra nasty)"., p. 32 (note 15, "Editors Notes")
In Parma Eldalamberon 17 appear the roots "? UK, UKLA" (without any given significations, except for being one of the opposites of AYA)., pp. 149, 188 It has been suggested that "the queried stem uk in this note is perhaps the same as later UK nasty"., p. 14Note that the two different transcriptions have been rendered from the reading of the same manuscript: "? uk: ukla" in Vinyar Tengwar 49 and "? UK, UKLA" in Parma Eldalamberon 17. Perhaps the latter was editorially changed to the standardized form given to roots.
