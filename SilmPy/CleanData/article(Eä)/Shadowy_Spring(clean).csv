Shadowy Spring was located in Ered Gorgoroth, between the Pass of Aglon and Dorthonion. It was the shared source of the rivers Esgalduin and Aros which marked the realm of Doriath. 
On the Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien portrayed the spring of the two rivers as being separate, despite the rivers sharing a common spring on that map which he based his version on, p. 409 and on a commentary to the The First Silmarillion Map (map) by his father he admits his portrayal on the published Silmarillion map to be in error. p. 222
