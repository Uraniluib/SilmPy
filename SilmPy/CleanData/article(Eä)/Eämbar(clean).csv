Eämbar (Quenya, pron. ) was a ship built by Tar-Aldarion to act as headquarters for the Guild of Venturers. It was a massive ship, designed to be more of a dwelling-place than a sailing vessel. Originally anchored off the island of Tol Uinen in the bay of Rómenna, it was later moved to the ports of Andúnië.  At some later date the ship was confiscated by the Kings and all of its records (including the accurate charts of Númenor) perished in the Downfall., note 8
== Etymology ==
"Sea Home" in Quenya (from eär = "sea" and bar = "home").
