===The Ainur===
*Main article: Ainur
Before Eä, Ilúvatar created the spirits known as the Ainur, the Holy Ones. The greater were called Valar and the lesser Maiar.
Some of the spirits were associated with a certain Wikipedia:Classical element, or physical phenomenon: 
*Air spirits: Spirits shaped like hawks and eagles delivered messages to Manwë as he sat in his throne in Ilmarin upon Taniquetil.
*Fire spirits: The Maia Arien is said to have been "from the beginning a spirit of fire". Melkor seduced some of the fire spirits, which became known as the Balrogs.
*Water spirits: A host of spirits followed Ulmo to maintain the waters of Arda, of whom the Maiar Ossë and Uinen were the greatest. ("Salmar came with Ulmo to Arda, ... and Ossë and Uinen also, to whom he gave the government of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas, and many other spirits beside.") Perhaps Salmar, and Goldberry and the River-woman were such water spirits.
*Shadow spirits: It is told that Morgoth sent "spirits of shadow" against Tilion, as he hated the light of the Sun and Moon.
===Evil spirits===
All Ainur originally adhered to Eru, but the Vala Morgoth became corrupted and fell from the grace of Ilúvatar. Melkor "gathered to himself spirits out of the voids of Eä that he had perverted to his service", and these became known as the Úmaiar or demons., pp. 53 (§17), 79 (commentary to §30)
In the late Third Age, spirits of "evil vigilance" are said to have abode in the Two Watchers. The Barrow-wights are furthermore said to be evil spirits who had entered in deserted mounds, stirring the bones of the dead.
==Names==
In Quenya, a collective name for the spirits were ëalar., p. 165 (commentary on §18)
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an early version of Tolkiens mythology, tiny, gleaming spirits appear dancing in An Evening in Tavrobel about Tavrobel., pp. 284-5>
