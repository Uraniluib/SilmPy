__NOTOC__
The Desert of Lostladen was a region between Nurn and Near Harad, just south of Mordor. Nothing else is known of the desert, and the name is only found pencilled on a map made for The Return of the King., pp. 413, 426 (note 35), 435, 439 (note 4)
==Etymology==
In an early sketch of the chapter "The Last Debate", the region was called the Lothland desert. Christopher Tolkien has therefore noted that the name Lostladen is likely related to the names Lothlann/Lothland found in the The Etymologies (cf. Sundocarme LAD and LUS)., p. 426, pp. 367, 370
