File:Narfil Palùrfalas - House-of-the-Tree.jpg

The House of the Tree was one of the noble Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim of Gondolin, under the leadership of Galdor of the Tree.  They wore green, and carried iron-studded clubs and slings.  
During the Fall of Gondolin, they were one of the two main Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim that first hurled themselves upon the Balrogs and Orcs upon the destruction of the Gate of Gondolin.  They guarded the western entrance to the Arch of Inwë.  Many escaped the slaughter with Tuor, and were scouts ahead of the women and children, for they had "eyes like cats in the dark", later dwelling at the Mouths of Sirion. They are often referred to as the People or Folk of Galdor.
