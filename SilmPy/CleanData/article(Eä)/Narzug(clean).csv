Narzug was a member of the Orcs pack that was pursuing Thorin and Company in the The Hobbit (film series). He was played by Ben Mitchell.
==History==
When the pack had caught up with the Company during their escape from the Woodland Realm, Narzug was ultimately taken prisoner by Legolas and Tauriel, and they take him back to the Elvenkings Halls. When being interrogated by Thranduil about why the pack was pursuing the company of Dwarves, Narzug claims his master is serving "Sauron", which causes some alarm to the Elven-king, triggering him to cut off Narzugs head.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
