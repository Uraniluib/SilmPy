The Fall of Fingolfin was a name given to the noble yet hopeless end of Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor. After the destruction of the Dagor Bragollach, he rode in anger to the gates of Angband, and challenged Morgoth himself to single combat. Though he fought bravely, he could not hope to best the Dark Lord, and he was lost.
