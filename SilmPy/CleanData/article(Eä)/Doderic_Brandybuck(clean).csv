Doderic Brandybuck was a Hobbit of the Shire.
==History==
Doderic was a son of Seredic Brandybuck and Hilda Bracegirdle. He attended Bilbos Farewell Party.
==Etymology==
Since it belongs to a Brandybuck, the name is Celtic-sounding. However it is perhaps a form of Germanic Wikipedia:Theuderic meaning "people reign".Jim Allan (ed.), An Introduction to Elvish, "Giving of Names"
