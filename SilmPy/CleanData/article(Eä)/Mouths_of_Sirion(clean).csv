The Mouths of Sirion was the great delta where the Sirion, the main river of Beleriand, emptied into the sea, in the north-east corner of the Bay of Balar. The land about the mouths was named Lisgardh; it was a region of reeds dense as a forest.
==History==
Between  and  the Valar assailed Morgoth in Middle-earth., §48 In the upheavals of that time the Sirion was created and its waters first flowed into the Bay of Balar, creating the Mouths of Sirion.
During the years of Morgoths captivity the Sindar spread across Beleriand and Círdan with his mariners explored the coasts. Doubtless they knew of the place where Sirion met Belegaer, but no secret refuge was hidden in the reeds until much later, in , the year after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. That was when Brithombar and Eglarest were destroyed by Morgoths forces and Círdan with the remnants of his people fled to the Isle of Balar or to the Mouths of Sirion where they established the secret havens.
In  the Second Kinslaying occurred. Doriath was destroyed and those few who escaped, including Elwing, fled to the Havens of Sirion. In  Gondolin fell and by the next year refugees from that kingdom, including Idril and Tuor, came to the Havens. Drúedain refugees from the fall of the Haladin came also to the Mouths of Sirion, reduced to a small number of families of mainly women and children.
Eärendil wedded Elwing in  and he was accounted the lord of those living in the Havens of Sirion. Eärendil became a friend of Círdan and with his aid built his ship Vingilot, in which he sailed west but was unable to reach Valinor. Having learned of the survival of Elwing and Eärendil, Maedhros mustered a troupe to retrieve the Silmarils that had been Fëanor. While Earendil was away in  the sons of Fëanor attacked and though the forces of the remaining Sons of Fëanor were not very large, they ravaged the Havens and slaughtered most of the people. They could not find the Silmaril, however nor Elwing who went into the Belegaer with it, and Círdan and Gil-galad were too late to do anything. Elwings sons, Elros and Elrond, had been found by Maglor, who and raised them well out of pity and remorse. Those few who escaped this Third Kinslaying went to the Isle of Balar in the ships of Círdan and Gil-galad. From that time on the Havens were in ruins and deserted.
The chief army of the Valar landed at the Mouths of Sirion during the War of Wrath. By the end of the War, most of the survivors of Beleriand gathered at the Mouths and the Isle of Balar, and many of them went to Lindon until the Elves were summoned to Valinor, and the Edain to the new isle of Númenor.
