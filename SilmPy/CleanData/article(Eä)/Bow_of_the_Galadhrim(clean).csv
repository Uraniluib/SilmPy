File:Michael Kaluta - Legolas Draws the Bow of Galadriel.jpg 
The Bow of the Galadhrim was the Gifts of Galadriel Galadriel bestowed to Legolas.
Before the Fellowship of the Ring left Lothl√≥rien, Galadriel presented each of them with gifts. To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used. The bow was longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and it was strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows. The bow proved to be a very useful gift indeed, for it was with this bow that Legolas shot down the descending Fell beasts from the sky, near the rapids of Sarn Gebir.
