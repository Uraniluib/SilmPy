The Andaith or "long mark" was the long-vowel diacritical mark used in Tengwar of the Tengwar/Mode of Beleriand.  In this mode of full writing, vowels were represented by separate letters rather than as tehtar so a different means was needed to indicate long vowels.  The andaith appeared as an acute accent.
