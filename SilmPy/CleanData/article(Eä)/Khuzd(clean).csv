__NOTOC__
Khuzd pl. Khazâd was the Khuzdul word for the "Dwarves". 
==Etymology==
The word comes from the Sundocarmë Kh-Z-D; it is also visible in the words Khuzdul and perhaps Nulukkizdîn.
==Derivatives==
The plural form Khazâd is the basis of Quenya casar and Sindarin hadhod. 
The Adûnaic word hazad, meaning "seven", is presumably also related.
==Examples==
* Moria
* Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!
==Other versions==
In earlier versions, the plural was Khuzûd  pp.274, 278
