Calembel was a town in the Lamedon region of Gondor. It was located on the road between Erech and Pelargir, at the fords of the river Ciril.
==History==
During the War of the Ring, the town was deserted. Most of the men had gone to fight in Minas Tirith, and those that remained fled into the hills as they heard news of the coming of the Oathbreakers.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkien translated Calembel as "Greenham"., p. 537 (citing from the Unfinished index) The name likely consists of Sindarin calen "green" + pÃªl "fence".
