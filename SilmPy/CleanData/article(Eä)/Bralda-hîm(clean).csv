Bralda-hîm (Heady Ale) was the long river that flowed southward from Nenuial was called Baranduin by the Elves, a name that meant approximately golden brown river. When the Hobbits settled in the Shire during the Third Age, a part of this river formed their new eastern border, and they took a name modelled on the original Elvish: Branda-nîn, meaning border-water. 
In the playful, punning character of the Hobbits, though, the rivers name evolved over time to become Bralda-hîm, relating to its golden brown colour and meaning heady ale. This later name became the ultimate source of J.R.R. Tolkiens anglicised version of the Hobbit-name, which is Brandywine.
