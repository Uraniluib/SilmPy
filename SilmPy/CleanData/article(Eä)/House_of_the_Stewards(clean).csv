The House of the Stewards was a building in the Hallows of Minas Tirith, situated near the House of the Kings on Rath DÃ­nen.
It was capped by a great dome, and within was a wide vaulted chamber with shrouded walls.  This was filled with marble tables upon which were carved forms of sleeping men - the tombs of the Stewards of Gondor.
It was the location where Denethor immolated himself on 15 March,  destroying the building.
