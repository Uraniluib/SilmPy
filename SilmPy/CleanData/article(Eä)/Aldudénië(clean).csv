Aldudénië (Quenya, possibly pron. ) is a poem lamenting the death of the Two Trees, composed by Elemmírë (Elf) of the Vanyar, soon after the Darkening of Valinor. It was famous to all the Eldar.
==Etymology==
Aldudénie is said to mean "lament of the Two Trees" and contains alda, the dual of alda "tree".
The other element *dénie which obviously means "lament", is of problematic etymology since the intermedial "d" does not exist in Quenya (only the "ld" "nd" and "rd" are present).
Another similar Quenya word for lament is nainië from Sundocarmë NAY.
