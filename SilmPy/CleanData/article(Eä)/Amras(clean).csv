In the draft of the legend of Amrod, after his brothers death in the swan-ship of the Teleri at Losgar, Amras dared speak against his father, and was the last to do so. It should be noted to avoid confusion that in this draft the twins were switched, and Amrod (Umbarto or Ambarto) was the younger and Amras (Ambarussa) the elder. In The Silmarillion, Amrod is the elder and Amras is the younger.

In earlier stages of development, Amras name changed a number of times. In The Book of Lost Tales Part Two his  name was Díriel, Dinithel and Durithel. , pp. 241, 245, 251
