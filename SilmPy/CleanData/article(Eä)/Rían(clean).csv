==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an early version of the Grey Annals the wife of Belegund and Rían were in Hithlum when the Dagor Bragollach occurred and thus they did not have to escape from Dorthonion.  This was superseded by the story of Emeldir and her escape with the women and children from the highlands.
In the Grey Annals the year of Ríans marriage to Huor was  in one paragraph, yet in the year  it is said that they wedded in the first days of spring and that Huor was summoned to battle two months later.  In The Silmarillion the latter version was used.
