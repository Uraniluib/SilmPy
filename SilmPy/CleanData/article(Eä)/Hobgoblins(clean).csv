Hobgoblin was a name "for the larger kinds", p. 24 of Orcs found in Middle-earth in the Third Age. In the Quest of Erebor for Lonely Mountain, Gandalf warns Bilbo Baggins that the Grey Mountains are "simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
The term appears only twice in the published writings on the legendarium (both in The Hobbit). It has been speculated that "the term perhaps, but doubtfully, refers to the large soldier-orcs known as Uruk-hai""http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/h/hobgoblins.html Hobgoblins", at http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/default.asp Encyclopedia of Arda, as of 5 September 2010, possibly since Tolkien had not created the latter name by the time of his writing of The Hobbit.
In a 1971 letter to Roger Lancelyn Green, Tolkien commented that "the statement that hobgoblins were a larger kind is the reverse of the original truth."
