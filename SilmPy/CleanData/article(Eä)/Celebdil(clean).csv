Celebdil, also known as Silvertine and Zirakzigil, was one of the three peaks that stood above the Dwarves city of Moria. The other two were Caradhras (Redhorn) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead).
Celebdil was the southernmost of the Mountains of Moria and the Endless Stair led from the deepest halls of Khazad-dûm up to Durins Tower on the peak of the mountain. There the final battle between Gandalf and Durins Bane took place., "The White Rider"
