==Genealogy==




==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When "The Wanderings of HÃºrin" was being written there were different manuscripts with many name changes.  In the earlier version, Enthor was the younger brother of Hunthor and Manthor, and he was the captain of the guards near Brithiach whom Asgon met.  In the last manuscript captain "Enthor" was replaced by "Ebor" who was "a chief henchman of Manthors" and the words "younger brother of Hunthor and Manthor" were intended to be cut out, per Christopher Tolkien.  The newly named Ebor referred to Manthor as his lord rather than his brother, strengthening Christophers suggestion., p. 263
