zahar appears to be a Khuzdul word, only attested in the compound name Tumunzahar. The whole name is translated "Hollowbold", and Magnus Åberg has suggested that the element zahar means "hollow".Magnus Åberg, "http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.pdf An analysis of Dwarvish" at http://www.forodrim.org/index_en.html Forodrim.org (accessed 5 November 2011)
