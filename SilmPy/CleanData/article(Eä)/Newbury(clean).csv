Newbury was a town in the north-eastern Buckland, to the north of Crickhollow and next to High Hay., "A Part of the Shire" map
==Etymology==
Bury, from the Old English burh, means "fortified enclosure".Nottingham Universitys Institute for Name-Studies, http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aezins//kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=12884 Bury (accessed 8 June 2010) This, combined with Newburys proximity to The Hedge, perhaps suggests that Newbury was built as a more recent guard against intruders from the Old Forest.
