Otto Aster is a Men of Bree of Bree in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North. Lately, he has been worried about troubles in the south and thinks it would be wise to arm the four towns of Bree-land. He asked the Dwarves Grof to create weapons to arm the Bree-landers, but the Dwarf refused. Therefore, Otto sent Eradan (video game character), Andriel and Farin (video game character) to Grof to convince him. This was successful, and Grof returned to the Blue Mountains to forge weapons for Otto.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Forewarned is Forearmed This would however cost at least three months, while Otto feared they would need weapons earlier. Otto asked Eradan, Andriel and Farin to bring weapons to him, if they would find them on their journeys.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Ottos Arsenal
