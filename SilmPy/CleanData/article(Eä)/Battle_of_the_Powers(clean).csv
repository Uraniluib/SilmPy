The Battle of the Powers was the great battle between the Valar and Morgoth that took place soon after the awakening of the Elves. 
==History==
The battle was fought mainly because the Elves awakened, and needed deliverance from Melkors interference. The forces of Valinor easily triumphed in this battle.  Morgoth was driven from Middle Earth back to his fortress of Utumno, and a guard was placed over Cuiviénen to protect the newly-awakened Firstborn from his evil influence. However, this battle marred the area upon which it was fought. Its landscape was changed forever.
