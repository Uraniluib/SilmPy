Whitfurrows was a village or small town that lay in the Eastfarthing, on the East Road through the Shire, approximately midway between Frogmorton (about ten miles to the west) and the Brandywine Bridge (a similar distance to the east). It lay at the western edge of the Bridgefields region of the Eastfarthing. 
Whitfurrows appear to have been a centre or staging-post of some kind for the Shirriffs during the War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
David Salo suggests an etymology from possible Old English Hwitfure meaning "white furrows".
