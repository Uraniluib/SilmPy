Bridgefields was one of the most easterly regions of the Shire, lying within the Eastfarthing.  Bridgefields was a stretch of about ten miles that lay along the East Road immediately before it reached the Brandywine Bridge and left the Shire. In the western parts of Bridgefields were the townships of Whitfurrows and, a little to the north, Budgeford on the Water.  Budgeford was best known as being the home of the Bolger Family, one of whom - Fredegar Bolger - played a part in the departure of Frodo Baggins on his journey to Rivendell.
