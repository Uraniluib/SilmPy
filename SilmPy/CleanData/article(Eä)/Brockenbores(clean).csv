Brockenbores, or Brockenborings, was a network of tunnels in the northern part of the Shires Eastfarthing, in the hilly region of Scary.  This was one of the more outlying parts of the Shire, which was perhaps the reason that a band of Hobbits rebels led by Fredegar Bolger, hid here for a time when Sharkey took control of the Shire during the War of the Ring. 
==Etymology==
The name of this place is given as Brockenbores in the text of The Lord of the Rings, but as "Brockenborings" on A Part of the Shire. 
David Salo suggests a speculative derivation from Old English *Broccesboran.
The name(s) translate approximately as "badger-burrowings"., p. 767
