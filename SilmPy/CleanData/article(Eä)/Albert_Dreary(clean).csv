Albert Dreary was a drunken man outside the Prancing Pony inn in Bree seen crunching a carrot in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, played by Peter Jackson. Jackson reprised a similar character at the beginning of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, again appearing outside the Prancing Pony eating a carrot.
