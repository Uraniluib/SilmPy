__NOTOC__
Meduseld was the great Golden Hall that stood upon a green terrace in Edoras. It was topped with a straw roof, which made it appear as if it was made out of gold when seen from far off. Its walls were richly decorated with tapestries depicting the history and legends of the Rohirrim, and it served as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisers, and a feast hall.
