Halad or "Warden" was the title of the Chieftain of the Haladin who was the leader of the Folk of Haleth in the Forest of Brethil. The Halads residence was called Obel Halad., p. 263  His duties included command of the armed men of the land and leadership of the Folkmoot, the gatherings of the people called to make important decisions., p. 283
The position of the Halad was elective, chosen by the people of Brethil, but by custom all chieftains had come from the noble House of Haleth.  After Brandir had died in , (iii) The Haladin, p. 237 there was some contention in Brethil concerning who should become the next Halad.  Many had wished to elect Manthor but Hardang came from the senior branch of the family under Halmir and obtained the title., p. 270
==Etymology==
Since the chieftains of Brethil were elected from the family of Haldad it was natural to used the term "Halad" for the position.  Haldads name meant "watchdog" and was derived from hal(a), meaning "watch" or "guard".
When spoken of in a general way this official was called "The Halad";, p. 275 when name and title were spoken the title came second, as in "Hardang Halad"., p. 276  
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
All of the information about the office of the Halad comes from The Wanderings of HÃºrin in The War of the Jewels.  This was a late-written story that Christopher Tolkien regretfully chose not to use in The Silmarillion.
In a section not included in the story it was stated that Avranc, not of the House of Haleth, was chosen for the next Halad but that the authority and reverence of the office was gone., note 54, p. 308
In an isolated note J.R.R. Tolkien had written possible name changes.  One would have substituted Halbar for Halad., note 55, p. 309
