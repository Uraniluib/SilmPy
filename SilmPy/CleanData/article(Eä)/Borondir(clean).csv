Borondir Udalraph (died 15 April, ) was a Gondor soldier with some Éothéod blood: a forefather was a Captain of the Northmen who served under the Steward of Gondor. He was described as brave and an excellent rider.
==History==
Borondir was one of six riders sent out by Steward Cirion to seek the aid of the Northmen when the Balchoth threatened Gondors northern borders. He was the only one to reach Eorl alive, and brought him the Red Arrow and the Seal of the Stewards. On the journey South, he showed knowledge  of Lothlórien; he understood the strange mist they had to pass was not magic from Dol Guldur, but rather an effort by Galadriel to stop such magic. 
Borondir brought the Northmen to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, but did not survive the battle. His body was taken to the Silent Street, and his name and deeds were remembered in song: Rochon Methestel, "Rider of Last Hope".
==Other names==
Borondirs epithet Udalraph means "the Stirrupless"; he was a rider who did not need stirrups, like the Northmen.
