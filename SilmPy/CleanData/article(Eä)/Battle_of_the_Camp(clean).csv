The Battle of the Camp was a battle fought in Dagorlad between Eärnil II of Gondor and the northern coalition of Wainriders after the Disaster of the Morannon.
== Events Prior to the Battle ==
In , Wainriders from Rhûn made an alliance with the Haradrim, and a dual attack on Ithilien was launched. While the Wainriders assaulted Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the Poros and invaded South Ithilien. 
The northern assault of the Wainriders was met by the King of Gondor himself, Ondoher, with his two sons Artamir and Faramir (son of Ondoher). The Easterlings swept through Gondors defence, cutting down the King and his heirs and routing his army. Their victory complete, and Gondor defenseless before them, the Wainriders paused in North Ithilien to celebrate their conquest.
Their allies in the south had met with much less success. The Gondorian Captain Eärnil II had led Gondors inferior Southern Army to victory over the Haradrim, destroying their army in South Ithilien, to the north of the Poros. After his victory, Eärnil turned north.
== The Battle ==
The feasting Wainriders suddenly found their success reversed, as Eärnil appeared with his Southern Army, reinforced by fleeing members of Ondohers defeated northern troops. Eärnils army descended on the unprepared Wainriders, driving many of them into the swamplands of the Dead Marshes. The Easterlings, for so long a dreaded enemy of Gondor, did not march against Gondor for hundreds of years afterwards.  The battle was named after where it had taken place: the Battle of the Camp.
== Aftermath ==
Because there was no heir apparent to the throne, Ondoher and his sons having been killed in the battle, Eärnil was crowned by Pelendur, the current Steward of Gondor (even though Arvedui of Arthedain had already claimed it). He was a distant relative of Ondoher, and could trace his lineage back to Elendil and Anárion of old.
