Galvorn was a metal devised by Eöl from which he made resistant armor. Black and "shining like jet", it was hard as steel, but supple and malleable, proving resistant to all blades and darts.
Its possible that galvorn was forgotten or lost with Eöls death, as it was not mentioned in the later Ages., p. 157, entry "Galvorn"
==Etymology==
The word galvorn translates as "shining black" in Sindarin. It is formed by combining gal, which means "shine" and morn, signifying "dark" or "black"."http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth" at http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com (accessed 8 June 2011)
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The original name of galvorn was rodeöl, the metal of Eöl. J.R.R. Tolkien changed this many times, to glindûr, targlîn, morlîn, back to glindûr, and then maeglin.  Finally galvorn was chosen., pp. 322-323
