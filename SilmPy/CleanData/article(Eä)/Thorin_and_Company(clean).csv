Thorin and Company refers to the thirteen exiled Dwarves under the leadership of Thorin Oakenshield and the one Hobbits Bilbo Baggins, who famously made the Quest of Erebor, travelling through the Misty Mountains and the Rhovanion to the Lonely Mountain, to recover their ancient treasure from the Kingdom of Lonely Mountain, stolen by the Dragons Smaug. 
Thorins company were: 
*Balin and Dwalin, descendants of Náin II
*Óin and Glóin, cousins of Balin and Dwalin
*Fíli and Kíli, nephews of Thorin
*Dori, Nori, and Ori, Dwarves of the House of Durin
*Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur, descendants of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm 
*And Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire
They were joined by Gandalf for part of the journey.
Thorin referred to himself and his Dwarven companions as "Thorin and Company" in the opening line of the message left on Bilbos mantelpiece after the An Unexpected Party at Bag End.
===Portrayal in adaptations===
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:The thirteen dwarves all feature in the films, although they do not wear coloured hoods, but are given more developed personalities. Unlike in the book, the Company is pursued by a pack of Orcs - led by Azog - throughout their quest. Thorin is portrayed as younger than in the book (where he was the oldest), and Ori is also portrayed as being younger than Fíli and Kíli. When reaching the mountain, the nine Dwarves actually do battle with Smaug instead of hiding from him in the Battle of the Forges. The remaining four Dwarves who stayed behind in Lake-town journey to Erebor after Smaug is slain.
