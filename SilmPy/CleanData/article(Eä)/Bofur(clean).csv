:In The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, due to excessive partying the night before, Bofur ends up oversleeping and being left behind in Lake-town when the other Dwarves finally head up to the Lonely Mountain. With Óin and Fíli also having stayed behind to tend to the sickly Kíli (due to having been struck by a poisoned arrow), he joins them in doing so. He is ultimately assigned with the task of finding some Athelas to help heal Kílis wound, which he does.
