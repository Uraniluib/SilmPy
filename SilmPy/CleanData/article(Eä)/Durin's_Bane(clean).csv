Durins Bane refers to a specific Balrogs who was not otherwise named. It was probably one of the last of its kind, having survived the War of Wrath. After his long hibernation, he was awoken by the Dwarves in the Third Age and encountered by the Fellowship of the Ring.
==History==
===Before Hibernation===
Durins Bane was created as a Maia, and followed Morgoth to Arda soon after its creation, like the other Balrogs. There it most likely fought in all major battles until the end of the First Age. When the Valar came against Morgoth in the War of Wrath, Durins Bane managed to flee and escaped into the east from the ruins of Angband, burying itself in the roots of the Misty Mountains, beneath Moria.
===Awakening and Third Age===

For more than five millennia, the Balrog hibernated in its deep hiding place at the roots of the mountains in Moria. It remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third Age, before the mithril-miners of Dwarves-King Durin VI awoke it in . Durin was slain by the creature, at which point it became known as Durins BaneJ.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A, Durins Folk. 
The Dwarves attempted to fight the Balrog, but its power was far too great. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, King Náin and many of the Dwarves were killed and the survivors were forced to flee. This disaster appears to have also reached the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, many of whom also fled the "Nameless Terror" (it was not recognized as a Balrog at the time). The elves began to call the place Moria, "The Black Pit". 
For five hundred years, Moria was left to the Balrog J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Appendix B. 
Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect around the year 2480 of the Third Age. As part of these, he sent Orcs and Trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar all of the passes. Some of these creatures came to Moria. It is unclear whether Sauron could have controlled the Balrog (they were both Maiar) but it is probable that they would have been allied against the "common good". The Balrog did allow the Orcs and trolls to remain in Moria while it dwelt there. We do not know whether Sauron was aware of the Balrogs presence prior to this time.
The Battle of Azanulbizar was the climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. It took place before the eastern gate of Moria in 2799 and was a victory for the Dwarves. However, the victors did not conquer Moria because Dáin Ironfoot, having slain the Orc Azog, felt the terror of the Balrog at the gate. Despite a failed attempt to recolonise Moria by Balin in 2989, Durins Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves whose nature was hidden to the outside world.
===During the War of the Ring===
In January of 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring travelled through Moria on the way to Mount Doom. There they encountered Durins Bane at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Elf Legolas instantly recognised the Balrog despite having never seen one before. More importantly, the Wizards Gandalf was there (perhaps for this very purpose); knowing that it was far more powerful than even the greatest of his companions, he challenged it.
Since Gandalf and the Balrog were both Maiar, they were beings of the same order. As they faced each other, Gandalf broke the Bridge in front of him, but as the Balrog fell it wrapped its whip around Gandalfs knees, which dragged him to the brink.  Gandalf staggered and fell, sliding into the abyss, crying "Fly, you fools!" and was gone.  Neither he nor the Balrog was killed by the fall, and Gandalf pursued the creature for eight days until they climbed to the peak of Celebdil.  Here they Battle of the Peak. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and it broke the mountain-side as it fell.  Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.
==Portrayal in adaptations==

File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Balrog.jpg
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Durins Bane has wings, albeit wings that were purely decorative as the Balrog could not fly. Jacksons Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only its horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen.
:In the film continuity, the Orcs of Moria (here specified as "goblins") have crafted their armor and weapons to match the fiery appearance of the Balrog, apparently worshipping it as a deity.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:The Balrog is the boss of the level "Abyss Fight". He cannot be harmed except when he is stunned with Gandalfs lightning.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age:
:The players assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog.
2004: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth:
:Many of the Evil factions can summon a Balrog, specifically Durins Bane for a short period of time. It is one of the mightiest units in the game, only able to be summoned with experience points. It is similar in design to the movie Balrog.
2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:Like in the previous installment, the Balrog can be summoned by evil factions.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Durins Bane can be observed in two "session plays" (player character not present): one depicts the awakening of the Balrog by Dwarves under Durin VI, the other depicts dwarves of Balins company fleeing from the ancient evil. After Gandalf defeats him, the lifeless body of Durins Bane can be found on the slopes of Celebdil. Despite the players knowing the Balrog dead, another Servant of Sauron tests their will and fears, by portraying an illusion of it. In the illusion, the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog on the Endless Stair is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Balrog defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Balrog in order to combat the illusion.
2013: Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game:
:Durins Bane is only seen as a light that chases the player(s) through Moria.  When they reach the bridge of Khazad Dum, it appears in a cutscene where Gandalf destroys the bridge and the Balrog pulls him down.  Then, the player is Gandalf and has to grab Glamdring and land on Durins Bane, where he has to stab it while avoiding the balrogs firey breath.  When this is over, the game starts another cutscene that ends the level.  Later, Gandalf appears on a snowy mountain with a tower on top.  When he reaches the top of the tower, the Balrog climbs on.  The Balrog repeatedly sweeps his fiery whip and strikes the ground with his sword.  Then lighting begins to strike at one place and the Balrog breathes fire and is weakened.  Gandalf uses his sword to direct the lightning at Durins Bane and its health goes down.  The lightning will strike at three different places, and when the Balrog loses all of its health by being hit three times, it will fall off the mountain and die.
