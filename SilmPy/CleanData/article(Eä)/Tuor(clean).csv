==Etymology==
The name Tuor was adapted to Sindarin from the language of the Edain., pp. 348, 364 (note 49)In a draft for a letter, Tolkien used the form Túor (cf. ).
In the The Etymologies, Noldorin Tuor ("strength-vigour") derives from Common Eldarin tūghor, tū-gor (Sundocarme TUG-)., p. 394 In the context of this etymology, Tuor can likely be analysed as tû ("strength") + a derivative of root GOR ("violence, impetus, haste")., pp. 359 (entry GOR-), 394 (entry TUG-)
Tuor bore the epithets Eladar (Sindarin Starfather), Ulmondil (Quenya Friend of Ulmo) and the Blessed.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Tuor is intimately connected with the tale of The Fall of Gondolin, one of the core legends of the Elder Days and the earliest narratives of the legendarium to be composed by Tolkien.. A compressed version of the story written between 1926 and 1930 was edited by Christopher Tolkien and included in the published The Silmarillion as Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin. There also exists a more substantial but unfinished narrative, started by Tolkien in 1951, which was published in Unfinished Tales under the title Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin.
===The Fall of Gondolin===
The only complete source on Tuor therefore remains the very early The Fall of Gondolin (chapter), written while Tolkien was on sick-leave from the army in 1917 and later incorporated into The Book of Lost Tales. In this version nothing is said about Tuors early life and lineage, though later he introduces himself to the Gondolindrim as "Tuor son of Peleg son of Indor of the house of the Swan of the sons of the Men of the North". He is described as a hermit ("Tuor of the lonely heart") living in the woods of Mithrim who simply happened upon the Gate of the Noldor and so came to live in a cave by the sea. Ulmo&mdash;employing swans, which Tuor as in later versions took as his emblem&mdash;then guided Tuor from the shores of the sea to a group of Noldor, who took him through the fenland region of Arlisgion and hence to the Nan-tathren. Here Tuor would have stayed, but Ulmo appeared to him directly and ordered him to seek Gondolin. In this version he did not receive his arms from Turgon until he reached Gondolin.

Conversely Tuors years in Gondolin are described more fully in the Lost Tale than in any subsequent text. He bore an axe called Dramborleg and is said to lived in a house on the southern wall of the city. He is also named as the leader of one of twelve Houses of Gondolin, the House of the Wing, whose emblem was the wing of a swan or gull. Tuors deeds in the Fall of Gondolin are also given. After rescuing Idril and Eärendil from the treacherous Maeglin, and leaving Voronwë to guard them, he and his company made their way to the battle at the gate. Here they fought alongside Ecthelion as dragons pulled down the walls of the city and enemies poured in. Tuor is said to have slain three orcs: Othrod, Balcmeg and Lug; as well as five balrogs. Eventually however he was forced to retreat bearing the injured Ecthelion. After being rescued by Galdor of the Tree in the Square of the Folkwell, he rallied what remained of the defenders of the city and made for the Square of the Palace of Turgon. During its defence Tuor was set upon by Gothmog (balrog) and would have perished, but Ecthelion came to his aid and slew the Balrog, going to his own death in the attempt. At this point Turgon conceded the city was lost, as Doom of Mandos, and though he himself resolved to stay in the city ordered Tuor to lead the survivors through Idrils secret way. When they emerged onto the plain of Tumladen a Ulmo mist, and Tuor rescued Eärendel, who had fled the city earlier with a servant called Hendor, from a pack of wolf-riders. Tuor and the refugees were then attacked once more as they fled over the encircling mountains, by a balrog, but Thorondor and his eagles came to their aid. Glorfindel slew the balrog but was himself killed when its body fell on him.
The Fall of Gondolin ends with Tuor, Idril and Eärendel living at the Mouths of Sirion, however in Tolkiens notes for what was to be the next chapter of The Book of Lost Tales he mentions that Tuor disappeared while at sea., "The Tale of Eärendel".
In the different manuscripts of The Fall of Gondolin Tolkien alternated between Tuor and Tûr, but eventually settled on Tuor in the 1930s Silmarillion.
