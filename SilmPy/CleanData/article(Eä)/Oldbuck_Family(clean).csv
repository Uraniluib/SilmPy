The Oldbuck Family was an ancient family of Shire-hobbits, who went on to become one of the most well-known families of Shire. 
== History ==
Consisting of mainly Stoors blood, the members of this prosperous family came from the Marish, where they traced their heritage to one Bucca of the Marish, the first Thain of the Shire. Thainship was in the Oldbuck family until  (S.R. 740).
In that year, they settled across the Brandywine by Gorhendad Oldbuck, who later changed their surname to Brandybuck Family, after the river Brandywine.
==Etymology==
"Oldbuck" is the English translation of the genuine Hobbitish name Zaragamba Family, of the same meaning.
The word Wiktionary:buck means "goat" or "deer". It is the ultimate origin of the placename Buckland which means "Land of the deer".Mark T. Hooker, Tolkien and Welsh pp. 18-19
