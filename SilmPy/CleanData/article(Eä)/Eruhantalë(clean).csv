The Eruhantalë was the last of the Three Prayers to Ilúvatar spoken each year by the King of Númenor or Ruling Queen of Númenor of Númenor. In this ceremony, the monarch and his or her people gave thanks to Eru. It was held at the end of each autumn. During the Eruhantalë, the King or Queen would ascend the Meneltarma, accompanied by a silent, white-clad crowd of people. The ruler would make a prayer and a bloodless offering on the mountains summit, while three great Eagles, the Witnesses of Manwë, hovered overhead.
