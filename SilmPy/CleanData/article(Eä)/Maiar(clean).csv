The Maiar (singular Maia; Quenya, pronounced ) were those spirits which descended to Arda to help the Valar shape the World. They were numerous, yet not many were named, and few also took visible shapes in Middle-Earth. The Maiar were Ainur &mdash; technically, any Ainu that is not counted as a Vala is a Maia.
==History==
Their chiefs were Eönwë, banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and Ilmarë, the handmaid of Varda.
Each of the Maiar was associated with one or more particular Vala, and were of similar stock, though less powerful. For example, Ossë and Uinen, as spirits of the sea, belonged to Ulmo, while Curumo, who came to be known in Middle-earth as Saruman, belonged to Aulë the Smith.
Others included Mairon, also originally of Aulës people, who later became known as Sauron; Aiwendil, who was known in Middle-earth as Radagast the Brown and belonged to the people of Yavanna; and Olórin, known as Gandalf, who belonged to Manwë and Varda.The latters ways took him often to the house of Nienna from  whom he learned pity and patience, which perhaps aided him in his later struggles to unite the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against the power of Sauron.
The Blue Wizards travelled to the east, and never returned to the west. Their fate is unknown. The Balrogs, like Sauron, were Maiar corrupted by Morgoth. Their associated Vala is not known. Melian served both Vána and Estë.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest forms of the Legendarium, such as The Book of Lost Tales, many beings are said to be among the lesser Ainur, including dryads and mermaids. The concept of the Maiar was introduced in the reworking of the Annals of Valinor into the Annals of Aman, and superceded most references to such beings.
