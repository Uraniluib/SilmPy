Dernhelm was the alias taken by Éowyn when she broke the command of her uncle Théoden. As Dernhelm she befriended Meriadoc Brandybuck who was under the service of Théoden, and failed to recognize her. Together they rode Windfola to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It was as Dernhelm that she first challenged the Witch-king of Angmar.
