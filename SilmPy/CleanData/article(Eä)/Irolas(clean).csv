:Not to be confused with: Iorlas
Irolas was an officer on Minas Tirith in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. He is played by Ian Hughes. 
==History==
Irolas came down to the gate after Faramir had pulled out of Osgiliath, and praised the wisdom of Denethor. Soon after, he saw that wisdom again in play as he had to bring the severely wounded Faramir to his lord. Dumbfounded, Irolas witnessed the total breakdown of Denethor as he ordered everyone to abandon their posts. 
==Etymology==
Irolas is obviously an anagram of the canonical name Iorlas (the same way the character Madril is derived from Mardil). However, there is no actual background or etymology behind it.
==Inspiration==
In the commentary of , it is stated that he was originally to be called Beregond, but as the role was reduced, Peter Jackson saw little use in still calling him Beregond. On the The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, Irolas is identified as Imrahil instead.
