The Bree-landers or Bree-folk were the peoples who inhabited the Bree-land, Men and Hobbits who lived peaceably side by side. These two races, identified individually as the Bree-hobbits (the Little Folk) and the Men of Bree (the Big Folk). 
Their main settlements were four communities scattered around the Bree-hill: Bree itself, Staddle, Combe and Archet. 
==Culture==
They were a generally friendly folk, at least until the upheavals brought about by the War of the Ring. They had some dealings with the Shire-hobbits, though the road between Bree and their colony of the Shire was less travelled by the late Third Age. 
Bree measured time with the Bree Calendar which is obviously a Hobbitish localization of the Kings Reckoning.
They maintained their own dialect of Westron. The "Bree-dialect" did not use words like "history" and "geography" much betraying a disinterest in lore and the outside world.
