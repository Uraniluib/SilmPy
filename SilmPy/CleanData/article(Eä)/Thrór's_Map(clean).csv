Thrórs Map is a map that proved important in the retaking of Lonely Mountain.
==History==
File:Audrey Corman - Thrors Map.jpg.
As was traditional among the Dwarves, it was drawn with East at the top of the map and showed the Lonely Mountain of Lonely Mountain, the River Running River that flowed from it, and the lands about. It also contained mention of a Back Door to the Mountain, and (written in secret Moon-letters) instructions as to how it might be opened.
In his old age, Thrór set out to wander the lands of Middle-earth, but before departing he gave the heirlooms of his house to his son Thráin, including his Map. Years later, Thráin too set out into Middle-earth, seeking to recover Erebor himself, and taking with him the Map to guide his way. He was captured in the Wild by the servants of Sauron, but Sauron captured Thráin for one of the Seven Rings Rings of Power he bore, and so overlooked the Map he carried too. This proved to be a serious oversight, because Gandalf secretly entered Saurons lair at Dol Guldur while Thráin was a prisoner there, and managed to escape with the Map and the key that opened the secret door.
Using Thrórs Map, his grandson Thorin was able to lead Thorin and Company (and one Hobbits, a certain Bilbo Baggins) on his own quest to refound the ancient Dwarf-realm. Through many adventures, they were able to recover Erebor and bring about the destruction of Smaug, dealing Sauron a serious reverse.
==Runes==
The Map is decorated with Old English Runes which read a modern English text; this displays Westron of the Third Age written in cirth (Angerthas Erebor) as used by the Dwarves of Erebor.
The small text on the left, below the hand, reads.
