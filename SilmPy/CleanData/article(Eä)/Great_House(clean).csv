The Great House was the hall of the Master of Lake-town. It was located next to the central pool within the town and like the other buildings stood upon wooden pilings driven into the bed of the lake. In  Thorin and Company entered the Great House where there was a feast in progress. Although the Master was sceptical of Thorin claims, the Dwarves were welcomed by the people of Lake-town. The building was later smashed by the tail of Smaug when he descended upon the township.
