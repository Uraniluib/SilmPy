The word duban exists according to the explanation of Azanulbizar "Dimrill Dale" that denies that bizar is itself the word for "dale, valley". By this interpretation, the full name of the vale is duban Azanulbizar, but the initial element may be left out and understood. In this case, bizar means "stream, rill".
