Taur-im-Duinath, called the "Forest between Rivers" since it lay between the rivers Sirion and Gelion, was the dark and gloomy forest that extended over a vast area of land to the south of the Andram. None but a few Dark Elves ever wandered there.
==Etymology==
The name Taur-im-Duinath literally means "forest between rivers" in Sindarin, consisting of taur ("forest") + im ("between") + duin ("river") + -ath (collective plural suffix)., p. 38http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth at http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com (accessed 14 December 2011)
