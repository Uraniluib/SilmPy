Lenition is a phonological and grammatical aspect of Sindarin which reflects the phonological mutations of the language in its evolution from Old Sindarin.
==Historical background==
Lenition refers to the mutation of medial consonants, occurring usually between two vowels (VCV). It affected the Old Sindarin sounds p, t, k, b, d, g, m and s. 
The sounds w, kh were lenited only at the beginning of a word.
More specifically, the evolution of these sounds can be visualized in these examples:
;p > b: OS *kelepe > S celeb "silver"
;t > d: OS *atar > S adar "father"
;k > g: OS beleka > S beleg "great"
;b > v: OS *jabasse > S Iavas "autumn"Similar softening occurred in Quenya also.
;d > dh: OS *badro > S badhor "brother"
;g > ∅: OS *khugo > *huȝoThe intermediate stage of g to extinction was yogh > S hû "dog"
;m > v: OS *ramia- > S revia- "to wander"
;s > ∅: OS *thelese > *thelehe > S thele "sister"
;w- > gw-: OS wende > S gwend "maiden"
;kh- > h-: OS *khanda > S hand "intelligence"
==In compounds==
As a consequence, this process took place also in Old Sindarin compounds, when the initial letter of a word was no longer initial in a compound. Even in later compounds that would be pure Sindarin, the lenition was solidified as a rule, envisioning retroactively the lenition process from a theoretical Old Sindarin compound.
For example the word athrabeth "debate, converse (lit. across-word)" can be analyzed both as a derivative of OS word *athrapettha but also as a compound of Sindarin words athra- "across" + peth "word".
The fact that the above sounds mutated when medially was solidified as a rule
*thind + coll > Thingol (< ?OS *Thindakollo)
*cair + tân > Cirdan (< ?OS *Kiriatâno)
*fanui + dol > Fanuidhol (< ?OS *Fanoidolo)
*Edhel + sarn > Edhelharn (< ?OS *Edelosarno)
*harad + Gondor > Harondor (< ?OS *Kharagonddor)
*ar + gwend > Arwen (< ?OS *Arwende; no g would evolve between ar- and wende)
*or- + hall > orchal (< ?OS *orkhalna; kh would not lenite as h inside a word)
==Grammatical and Syntactical significance==
==Inspiration==
Sindarin, being inspired from the Welsh language, also borrowed heavily from its http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_morphology#Initial_consonant_mutation mutation systemJim Allan (ed.) An Introduction to Elvish "Sindarin grammar". The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition#Grammatical_lenition grammatical lenition is generally prominent in the Celtic languages.
