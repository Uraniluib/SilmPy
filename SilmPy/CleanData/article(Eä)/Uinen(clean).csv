Uinen was Ossës wife. A Maiar of Ulmo, she was known as the Lady of the Sea.
==Attributes==
Uinen loved and protected all creatures and weeds that live in the sea and brought calm seas. She could calm the tumultous waves of her husband Ossë and for this she was loved by mariners. She was revered among the Ainur by the Númenoreans.
It is said that her hair spread through all the surface of water.
== History ==
Early in the history of Arda, Ossë was corrupted by Morgoth but Aulë pleaded Uinen to persuade him to return to the service of Ulmo.
The Teleri of Olwë had much love for Uinen, as she and Ossë had befriended them at the river Sirion during the Great March.
Uinen wept for the Teleri mariners after the kinslaying at Alqualondë and rose a storm that sunk many Noldor on the stolen Swan-ships.
Considered a protector and bringer of calm seas by the mariners of Númenor, they would cry to her for help, while their respect for the Valar endured. The Guild of Venturers were also known as Uinendili.
== Etymology ==
Two explanations exist for the name Uinen. In The Etymologies, the first element came from a root UY-. Several other words under this lemma mean "seaweed", though the name Uinen itself is not explained., root UY- A later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish (Valarin) origin of unknown meaning., p. 404
Christopher Tolkien has noted that Uinen contains the element nén ("water")., (entry nen) It is unknown if he had access to unpublished manuscripts by his father to corroborate this suggestion or if he speculated on the matter.
