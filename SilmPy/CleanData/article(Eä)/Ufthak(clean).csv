Ufthak was an Orcs of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
==History==
Ufthak was captured and poisoned by Shelob, and encased in her webbings. Shagrat, his commander, saw him hanging there, but made no effort to free him as he was eager to leave the caves without making Shelob angry.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)
:Although not explicitly identified by name, a lone Orc can be found in the "Shelobs Lair" level, fighting for his life against Shelobs children in a small, web-filled chamber. While it might not truly be Ufthak himself, it may still be a homage to his fate. 
:He can be left to fend for himself, but he will start fighting the player if they choose to save him from his attackers.
