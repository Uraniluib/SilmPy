The Hill of the Slain, or Haudh-en-Ndengin in Sindarin, was a huge green mound that stood alone in the middle of the burned and ruined land of Anfauglith. It had been raised by Morgoths Orcs after the victory in the terrible battle of Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and beneath it lay the bodies of the Elves and Edain slain in that battle, along with their gear and weaponry.
Among the many slain heroes beneath the mound was Huor, the brother of Húrin and great-grandfather of Elrond. According some tales, Morgoth went there to taunt his prisoner Húrin after the Nirnaeth., p. 63 Huors wife Rían also went to the mound seeking her lost husband. When she came to the Hill of the Slain, she laid down in grief and died.
