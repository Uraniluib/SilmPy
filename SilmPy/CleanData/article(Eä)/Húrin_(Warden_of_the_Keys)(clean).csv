Húrin the Tall, also referred to as "Lord Húrin" or Húrin of the Keys, was the Warden of the Keys of Minas Tirith at the time of the War of the Ring. 
==History==
Húrin fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and along with Forlong, Hirluin, and Imrahil came to the aid of the Rohirrim when they were outnumbered and hard-pressed.
He was left in command of the small garrison that stayed behind while the armies of Gondor and Rohan marched to the Black Gate.  At the coronation of Aragorn, he opened the Great Gate of Minas Tirith for the new king.
