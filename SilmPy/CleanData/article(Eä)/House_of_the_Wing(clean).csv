File:Narfil Palùrfalas - House-of-the-Wing.jpg

The House of the Wing was one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim led by Tuor.  They wore wings as of swans or gulls upon their helms, and the emblem of the White Wing was upon their shields.  Its people were the stoutest folk of Gondolin. The House of the Wing was apparently one of the smaller houses, for those from the House of the Mole outnumbered them when they came to arms during the Fall of Gondolin.  They fought alongside the House of the Fountain at the breach in the wall. Outnumbered by the great hosts of Morgoth, they joined the surviving houses at the Square of the King. From there, most of its people went on before the rest of the exiles during the escape through Idrils secret way, cutting their way out of the hosts of Orcs, Dragons and Balrogs, making it to the mountains.  They were under Hendor, a house-carle of Idril, who carried Eärendil upon his back.
