Bucklebury was the chief village of Buckland, lying in the shadow of Buck Hill, seat of the Master of Buckland. It was built about a mile east of the banks of the River Brandywine.
The Bucklebury Ferry was a passage across the Brandywine between Bucklebury and the Marish.
==Etymology==
The name means Buck-burg, or Buck-town (buck always means male goat or deer).
J.R.R. Tolkien notes that its "Bucklebury" rather than plain "Buckbury" because the word is either an alteration of earlier Bucken-bury (Bucken being archaic plural) or a reduction of Buckland., p. 767
Based on this, David Salo has suggested that Bucklebury represents a possible Old English form *Buccanburh "Buccas burg".
