Thuringwethil (perished ) was a Vampire servant of Sauron during the First Age. She was Saurons messenger, but was caught in the battle between her master, Lúthien and Huan at Tol-in-Gaurhoth ("Isle of Werewolves"). She was slain either by the Hound of Valinor or in the collapse of Minas Tirith in Beleriand. Lúthien later used her cloak to sneak into Angband during the Quest for the Silmaril.
Because of Thuringwethils ability to change forms, she may have been a Maiar.
== Etymology ==
The name is glossed as "Woman of Secret Shadow" and an early version of the legendarium the name is said to mean "she of hidden shadow"., Note to line 3954, p. 304
The above can be analyzed as thurin "secret, hidden", gwath "shadow" and an obscure ending -il which perhaps denotes feminine gender. 
Note that -il causes "i-affection" (or "wikipedia:Affection (linguistics)") of gwath to gweth.
