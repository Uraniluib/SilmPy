Thráin I established the Kingdom under the Mountain fleeing from Moria. During his time the Arkenstone was discovered, the most prized possession of the Kingdom. His son, Thorin I, later became King under the Mountain but after seeing the wealth of the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains, he abandoned Erebor.  
When the Cold-drakes invaded the Grey Mountains, they drove most of the Dwarves out. Thrór, a descendant of Thorin I, took some of his people and flew the Grey Mountains for Erebor. His brother Grór continued east with a great following of Durins folk to the Iron Hills while himself refounded the kingdom of Erebor in .
===Second Kingdom===
The Dwarves gained the friendship of the Northmen along the Celduin and had much trade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the town of Dale. The Dwarves of Erebor also had much traffic of ores with their kinsmen in the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for many years.

The Dwarves were properous, and made great wealth for themselves until they were dispossessed of their immense wealth by Smaug the Dragon, who flew south from the Grey Mountains and Sack of Erebor their kingdom in .  
The Dwarves reclaimed their inheritance many years later under the leadership of Thorin.  But it was the descendants of Dáin Ironfoot that ruled there ever after.
===Third Kingdom===
After the restoration thanks to Thorin and Company, the Dwarves became again rich and prosperous under Dáins rule, as the Dwarves exceeded their ancestors in masonry and mining. Dale was rebuilt as a kingdom and they had close friendship with the Elves of Mirkwood.
Balin and other Dwarves set out to Balins Colony in . Dáin did not give his blessing when Balin, but could not dissuade them. It was only later learned the colony was destroyed after five years.
===War of the Ring===
In , a messenger came from Mordor, enquiring about "Bilbo Baggins" from "the Shire", promising the last three Seven Rings to Dáin. The King asked time to think and he sent Glóin and his son Gimli to Elrond for council, and to warn Bilbo.
The War of the Ring reached the North; King Brand fighting the Easterlings retreated from the River Carnen and was given aid by Dwarves in the Battle of Dale.  After three days of fighting Dwarves and Men were driven back, and Brand was slain, followed by Dáin. Several days later the Easterlings learned that the War was lost. When the new King Thorin Stonehelm, son of Dáin, and Brands Bard II saw this they came out of the mountain and routed their enemies.
Little is known of the reign of Thorin III, other than the Dwarves helped rebuild the cities of Minas Tirith and the fortress of Helms Deep. Some of the Dwarves colonized the Glittering Caves.
==Language and writing==
The Dwarves of Erebor spoke Khuzdul but used the Language of Dale for their public names.
Coming from Moria, the Dwarves brought with them the Angerthas Moria, which however was modified further. For some reason some runes of Angerthas Moria were reverted back to their Elvish values in Angerthas. The resulting variation was known as Angerthas Erebor.
