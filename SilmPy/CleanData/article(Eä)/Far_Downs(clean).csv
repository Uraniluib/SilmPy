The Far Downs were the downlands that marked the former western borders of the Shire, forty leagues (120 miles) west from the Brandywine Bridge. Of their geography almost nothing is known, except that the town of Greenholm seems to have been built among the Downs. 
King Aragorn extended the Shires borders westward to the Tower Hills in , with the Westmarch laying in-between. Fastred of Greenholm became the first Warden of Westmarch.
==Note==
In Ballantine Books paperback edition of The Fellowship of the Ring there was a misprint in the The Lord of the Rings Prologue that incorrectly named the Far Downs as the "Fox Downs".
