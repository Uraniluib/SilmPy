Makar was one of the Valar, described as a "warrior Vala". He only appears in the early versions of the legendarium. His sister was the "warrior goddess" Meássë.
== History ==
Before Makar came into Arda, he, along with Meássë his sister, was already a quarrelsome spirit, even going so far as to join Melko in his discord during the Music of the Ainur., p. 66
After arriving to Valinor, Makar and Meássë had built their dwellings, made of iron, in the north, close to those of Mandos and Fui.
The only Vala who visited his dwelling was Tulkas who went there only to wrestle and fight with Makar, although he did this only to keep his strength intact, for there was no friendship between the two., p. 79
When the Valar decided to seek out Melko and oust him from his dwelling at Utumno, he was the one who adorned them with armour., p. 107
After they brought Melko to Valinor for judgement, he was the only one to speak for him, being displeased with the prospect of peace., p. 111-112
When the Elves awoke, and the Valar invited them to live among the Gods, he was, again, the only one who spoke against the others, saying that Valinor was built for the Valar, and the Valar only., p. 125
After the Darkening of Valinor, he joined the other Valar in pursuit of Melko, who was fleeing north towards his old stronghold. Despite the chase, Melko escaped., p. 171 However, Makar managed to capture and slay two of Melkos servants, returning with a red hand, smeared with blood, being the only one who had any pleasure at the time, the Two Trees being destroyed., p. 198
