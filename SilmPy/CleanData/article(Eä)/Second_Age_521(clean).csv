* Birth of Silmariën, eldest child and daughter of Tar-Elendil and ancestor of the Lords of Andúnië., pp. 713-4, entry "IV Tar-Elendil" and note 4, entry "512"Silmariëns birth-year was originally stated as 548 in "Appendix B"; Christopher Tolkien stated "I think it very likely that this should have been revised but escaped notice." This error has since been corrected to 521 in the The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) of the The Lord of the Rings.
