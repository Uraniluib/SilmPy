Girdley Island was an island located in the Brandywine River, north of the Brandywine Bridge.
==Etymology==
David Salo suggests a possible Old English etymology from *Gyrdlieg "girdle-island".
As in Rushey, the ending Wiktionary:ey#Old_Norse means "island" in Old Norse and is found in English islandnames (cf. Wikipedia:Gurnsey#Etymology).
