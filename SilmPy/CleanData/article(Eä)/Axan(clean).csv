__NOTOC__
axan (pl. axani) is a Quenya noun meaning "law, rule, commandment, primarily proceeding from Ilúvatar"., pp. 23 and 30-31 The term refers to laws established by Ilúvatar that lesser beings are directed to follow but can choose to disobey. The axani contrast with the únati, which are physical laws that are impossible to break. Melkor refused to accept any axani as binding upon him, but much to his frustration, he was unable to violate the únati.
==Etymology==
It is said to derive from Valarin akašân, meaning "He says", with "He" referring to Eru., p. 399
==Inspiration==
axan is similar to the ancient Greek word Wikipedia:Anax (Greek) (wanakts, anax) meaning "ruler, lord, king". The Valarin form akašân, in the meantime, resembles the word Wikipedia:akasha, the aether in Hindu cosmology and mysticism.See Wikipedia links
