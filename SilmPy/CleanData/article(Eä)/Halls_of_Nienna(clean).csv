The halls of Nienna lay at the westernmost border of Aman, near the halls of Mandos. Here dwelt the Valar Nienna and it is said that the windows of her house looked "outward from the Walls of the World".
==Other versions of the legendarium==
As described in an early version of the legendarium, Nienna chose for her dwelling a wide and dark hall in the Halls of Mandos. This hall she named Fui, and therein:

At Fui was summoned the Men after death, to await their doom.Christopher Tolkien has noted that this conception changes in later versions, where it is instead Mandos who appears as the Doomsman of the Valar (, p. 90)., p. 77
