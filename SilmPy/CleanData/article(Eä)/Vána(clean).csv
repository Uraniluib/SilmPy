In The History of Middle-earth, Tolkien wrote that when the power of Yavanna had failed to heal the wounds of the Two Trees, Vánas love for Laurelin was so great that it caused the trees remaining life to come forth one last time as a fruit of gold from which the Valar later fashioned the Sun. Vánas maiden, Arien, would steer the Suns vessel across the sky. Vána, who repented of speaking against the harvest of Laurelins last fruit, cut her hair short to weave the tresses as the sails for the Sun-ship.
In The Silmarillion, Niennas tears cleansed the trees and Yavannas songs brought forth the final bloom of Telperion and fruit of Laurelin; Vána was not involved.
