* Ulmo moves the isle of Tol Eressëa to the Bay of Balar. Ulmo summons the Elves to embark on the isle and leave for Aman; only the Vanyar and the Noldor hear the summons and they leave Middle-earth without the Teleri.
* Part of the island breaks off and remains in the Bay, becoming the Isle of Balar.
* The Teleri, in the east of Beleriand, search for their lord Thingol. Unsuccessful - and discovering that Ingwë and Finwë had already departed - they make Elwës brother Olwë their lord. They push onto the shores and are befriended by Ossë and Uinen and become lovers of the seas.
