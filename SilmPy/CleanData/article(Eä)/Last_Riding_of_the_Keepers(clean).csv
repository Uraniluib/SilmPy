The Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings was the procession of Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo Baggins, and other Calaquendi that rode westward to the Grey Havens in September .  On 22 September Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee joined them in the Woody End of the Shire and on 29 September the Riding came to the Grey Havens where they found Gandalf.  All of the riders save Sam then boarded a White Ship.  At that time Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck arrived and after the ship had sailed the three friends returned to the Shire.  Those aboard the ship sailed to Aman and never returned to Middle-earth.
