File:Alan Lee - Rover and Psamathos.jpgPsamathos Psamathides was a wizard in Roverandom. Psamathos is the oldest of the Psamathists - sand-sorcerers - is exceedingly old and wise, and enjoys spending his days sleeping in the sand.
In the story, Psamathos helps Rover by turning him back into a real dog (albeit of smaller size). As Rover doesnt wish to go home, Psamathos has his postman Mew (a seagull) take Rover to the moon. When Rover (now "Roverandom") returned from the moon, Psamathos tried to return Roverandom to his normal size but his magic could not undo Artaxerxess spell. Psamathos summons the giant whale Uin to take Roverandom to the bottom of the Deep Blue Sea to persuade Artaxerxes to return him to the normal size. At the end of the story, Roverandom is reunited with Psamathos and they become good friends.
