Weathertop, known in Sindarin as Amon Sûl, was the southernmost top of the Weather Hills. It stood a little away from the others, and its conical top was flattened.
Of old, it formed the boundary between Arthedain and Rhudaur.
==History==
===Early history===
The Weather Hills lay at the centre of Arnor, near the Great East Road that split Eriador.
A tower had stood on the hill since the days of Elendil, and he had stored the Palantíri in its chambers. After King Eärendur (King of Arnor) passed and the kingdom was split in three, all of his sons coveted the hill, or rather the Amon Sûl-stone inside. It lay on the exact tri-state point, but eventually passed to Arthedain, the realm of Amlaith, the eldest son of Eärendur, although it already possessed the Elostirion-stone Annúminas-stone Stones.
===Destruction===

In the days of Argeleb I, the royal lines of Cardolan and Rhudaur had failed. Argeleb therefore claimed both realms as his own, hoping to reunite Arnor, but the claim was resisted by Rhudaur, where the Dúnedain had dwindled and the land was now largely ruled by hillmen, who were driven by the Witch-king of Angmar.
As tensions with Angmar increased, Argeleb fortified his border. A great bastion arose on Weathertop, and the Great East Road and lower Hoarwell were fortified also. For nigh half a century, the line held, though Argeleb lost his life in battle with the Hillmen. The Witch-king did not trouble the Men, and had sent his troops further East, to Rivendell. But in , he came forth with such a force from Angmar that no army could stop him. He razed Amon Sûl and brought its mighty walls down. Arveleg I, son of Argeleb, was slain, but the Lord of the Nazgûl failed to retrieve the palantir. It was secured and brought back to Fornost Erain.
===In ruins===

For many centuries, the once great fortress stood in ruins on the hill. The locals paid little heed to it. It faded back into obscurity, and it was not until  the hill reappeared in the chronicles and annals. In early October, it was the scene of two fights involving the Nazgûl; one with Gandalf on 3 October and one with Frodo Baggins 6 October. After fleeing from Bree, Aragorn and the Travellers avoided the main road and approached Weathertop from the north. At the top they discovered a cairn with a message from Gandalf, and spotted the Nazgûl approaching in the distance along the road. That night, the Ringwraiths attacked their camp in a dell below the summit, stabbing Frodo Baggins with a Morgul-knife, but were driven off by the others.

:The fight with the Nazgûl has been moved from the camp near the hill to the ruins of the tower.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Weathertop is the fifth level. Aragorn has to take the four Hobbits to the hilltop, battling wolves and Orcs on the way there. At the top, they notice Gandalf had been there, and dropped a rune stone. As he explains it to Frodo, a troll attacks, and serves as the levels boss.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game):

2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:

The bastion is protected by five mystical Mallorn trees: one generates a solar flare that incinerates enemies, one heals damaged buildings, one creates lush Elvish pastures (that boost the Mens armor and damage), one stuns targeted enemies and one summons a battalion of archers. The mission is completed when either all five mallorns are destroyed, or the tower falls.
:Additionally, two maps of Amon Sûl are available in Skirmish mode: one with the tower, which is identical to the mission save for the Mallorn trees, and one with the tower in ruins and all other buildings removed.
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
