Tol Fuin was an island off the coast of Forlindon.
==History==
When the waves consumed Beleriand and the regions around it after the War of Wrath, not all of the western lands were lost. The highlands that had been Dorthonion, and came to be called Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion), in part survived the inrush of the sea, and remained as an island far off the western coasts of Forlindon., pp. 124, 138, pp. 301-2
==Etymology==
From Sindarin for Dark Isle from tol and fuin.
