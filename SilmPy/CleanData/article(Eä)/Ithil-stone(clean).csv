Ithil-stone was the palantíri that stood in Isildurs ancient fortress of Minas Ithil placed there soon after the founding of the city. The stone was captured by the Nazgûl in  when the city fell to them (being known afterwards as Minas Morgul), and was used by Sauron to entrap Saruman and deceive Denethor during the War of the Ring. It is likely that the stone was destroyed in the fall of Barad-dûr.
