The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen was a Gondorians tale written in the early Fourth Age.  It told the story of the romance of Aragorn and Arwen from the days before Aragorns birth until Arwens despair at his loss.
==History==
The Tale was written in Gondor by Barahir (grandson of Faramir), the grandson of Prince Faramir of Ithilien.  It was inserted into a copy of the Thains Book by Findegil, but in a shortened form - the passages relating to the War of the Ring were removed to avoid repeating the main tale of that Book.
