WOR is an Elvish Sundocarme signifying "express, cause to exude (by pressure)" and is an element in the word miruvor., p. 38, p. 191  
Note that the root appears to have been rejected by J.R.R. Tolkien, who wrote that "this is Wikipedia:false etymology ... there was not in fact any word wor- in Elvish, Quenya or Sindarin." One can interpret Tolkiens note in several ways:
*The Elves falsely thought that the latter elements of miruvor derived from a presumed root WOR.
*Tolkien altogether removed the root WOR (and its relation to miruvórë/miruvor) from the legendarium .
