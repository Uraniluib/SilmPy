The Fall of Gil-galad is the lay that tells of the loss of Gil-galad, the last Great Elf-king of Middle-earth and the last High King of the Eldar, in the Siege of Barad-d√ªr at the end of the War of the Last Alliance. 
==Song==
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.
His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heavens field
were mirrored in his silver shield.
But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Mordor where the shadows are.

==History==
According to Aragorn, it was originally written in an ancient tongue. It was Bilbo Baggins who later translated it into the Westron, and taught it to Samwise Gamgee in his youth. It seems to be a long poem, telling the story of the War of the Last Alliance, at least to the point where Gil-galad aided in the overthrow of Sauron, and was himself slain. 
Sam narrated the three introductory stanzas while approaching Weathertop. Aragorn and Frodo knew more of the text.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
: Sam sang the song during his trip to Rivendell.
