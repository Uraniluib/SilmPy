Fuinur was a Númenórean who had been turned towards darkness after Sauron had been brought to Númenor.  He then journeyed to Middle-earth and rose to power among the Haradrim.  When Sauron returned to Middle-earth and assailed the realm of Gondor, Fuinur and a fellow Black Númenórean named Herumor apparently joined Saurons forces.
