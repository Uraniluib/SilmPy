Eithel Sirion, "Sirions Well", was the initial spring and northernmost point of the great River Sirion.
Eithel Sirion was located in the eastern part of the Ered Wethrin and overlooked the plains of Ard-galen. From this spot the Sirion flowed south and then slightly east, skirting the plains, to the Fen of Serech. There was a pass west of Either Sirion through the mountains that led to Mithrim.
After Fëanor had been mortally wounded by Gothmog (balrog) his sons carried him away from Dor Daedeloth. As they began climbing the pass near Eithel Sirion, Fëanor had them stop, he cursed Morgoth three times, and then he died. As it left, Fëanors fiery spirit consumed his body to ash; no tomb was made for him there or elsewhere.
Fingolfin built a great fortress in this location called Barad Eithel, from whence a watch was kept upon the plains. However, in the Dagor Bragollach a host of Morgoths assailed this place and other fortresses of the Ered Wethrin. Near the Eithel Sirion Hador and his son Gundor fell in Fingolfins rearguard. Morgoth withdrew his forces after the Dagor Bragollach, but sent a new host against Hithlum seven years later. Again the Eithel Sirion and its fortress was a main point of contention and here Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin) fell.
At the beginning of the Fifth Battle, the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Fingon kept watch from the walls of the Barad Eithel for the beacon that would signal the start of the war. At the bidding of Húrin, Fingon held back his strength while the host of Morgoth marched up to the Eithel Sirion. Before the walls of the fortress Gelmir (son of Guilin), son of Guilin, was cruelly slain. This enraged his brother Gwindor who charged from the Eithel Sirion on horseback.
