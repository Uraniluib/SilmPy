Old Toby was one of the three most notable varieties of pipe-weed, grown in the region around Longbottom in the Shires Southfarthing.
==History==
The leaf took its name from the Hobbit who introduced pipe-weed to the Shire, the original "Old Toby", Tobold Hornblower, who grew the first true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim Took II about the year  of Shire-reckoning. 
How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell.
==Etymology==
The genuine Westron name was zara-Tobi.
