__NOTOC__
Fen Hollen or the Stewards Door was on the sixth level of Minas Tirith, in its rearward wall to the west. It led to Rath DÃ­nen (the Silent Street) and the Hallows where the tombs of the Stewards of Gondor and Kings of Gondor lay.
Guarded by a porter, the door was also called the Closed Door as it opened only for funerals, or to those who tended the tombs and had the token.
Around the time of the Siege of Gondor, Beregond killed the porter in order to save wounded Faramir and took his key. After he locked the Door again, Gandalf gave the key to the injured Faramir.
