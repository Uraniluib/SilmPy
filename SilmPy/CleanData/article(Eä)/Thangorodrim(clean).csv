Thangorodrim (pron. ) was a group of three volcanic mountains in the Iron Mountains in the north of Middle-earth during the First Age. The highest peaks in Middle-earth, they were raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them, and far back into the Iron Mountains.
==History==
File:Henning Janssen - Three Peaks Fortified.jpg - Three Peaks Fortified
Thangorodrim was said to have been the piles of slag from Morgoths furnaces and rubble from the delving of Angband, but at the same time they were solid enough to form sheer precipices; Maedhros was nailed to a cliff of Thangorodrim, and Húrin imprisoned on a high terrace. The tops of Thangorodrim perpetually smoked, and sometimes spewed forth lava. The three peaks of Thangorodrim functioned as furnaces for Morgoths great smithies deep in Angband.
For a time the Eagles lived on Thangorodrim, but at some time during the First Age they removed to the Crissaegrim near Gondolin.
At the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gates of Angband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and forts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the sides of the mountain group, from which Morgoths hosts could issue forth and surprise their foes.
Along with Beleriand and the entire west of Middle-earth, Thangorodrim was destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age when the defeated dragon Ancalagon the Black fell on them.
==Position and size==
The position and size of Thangorodrim are unclear. One drawing by J.R.R. Tolkien, if to scale, would have made Thangorodrim 35,000 ft high, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenóreans miles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in The Silmarillion to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have been more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien was not referring to as the eagle flies, but rather as the wolf runs: the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour which added the extra 200, 250 miles to the distance.Karen Wynn Fonstad (1991), The Atlas of Middle-earth
