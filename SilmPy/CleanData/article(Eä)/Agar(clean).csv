Agar was the name for the town and the land in the story of Tal-Elmar (character). On its location little information is given, except that it was a region of green hills, situated "three leagues away" from the shores of the Belegaer, and apparently closer to the ocean than the rival town of Udul. In a note near the end of the story there was a suggestion that the place was on the estuary of the Isen or perhaps the Morthond. The town was ruled by a town-master, who was named Mogru when Tal-Elmar lived in the town.
