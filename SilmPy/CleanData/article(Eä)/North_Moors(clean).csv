The North Moors lay along the northern border of the Shire in the Northfarthing.  It was the one place within the Shire where heavy snowfalls were common.  
Around the spring of , Halfast Gamgee reported seeing Ents or giants away beyond the North Moors.
==Inspiration==
Assuming that Halfasts story is not a fanciful fabrication and indeed he saw something strange, fandom have connected the "tree-man" to the Ents (or Entwives) that appear later in the story. However J.R.R. Tolkien specifically mentioned that he had not invented the Ents before the moment he reached the chapter Treebeard (chapter) and the "tree-man" reference was written before it., pp. 253-254 It is unknown whether Tolkien himself consciously considered such a connection or if he revisited the matter subsequently.
