Arien (Quenya, pron. , stem Ariend-) was the Maiar who guided the Sun.
==History==
Arien was originally a spirit of fire whom Morgoth failed to corrupt. In the days of the Two Trees, Arien was a Maia maiden where she tended to the golden flowers in the gardens of Vána. She would water the flowers of Vána with dew gathered from the golden tree Laurelin., pp. 264-5
After the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by Morgoth, Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Aulë crafted a vessel to hold the golden fruit. Arien was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun above the airs of Arda to give light to the World; Tilion, another Maia and one of Oromës hunters, was chosen to steer the Moon. The Moon had already traversed the sky seven times before the Sun was finally ready. The first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pelóri Mountains of Aman. Morgoth was dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost pit of Angband and his servants withdrew. He sent up dark clouds of smoke to conceal his land from the light of the Sun.
Tilion loved Arien and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat.
== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In other writings, Ariens name was Urwen or Urwendi, which translated in "Maiden of the Sunship". She was one of Vánas maidens who took care of the tree Laurelin; her task was to water it. When the Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed, she offered to steer the Ship of the Sun., p. 73
In Myths Transformed, which changed the timing of the Sun to have been primordial to Ardas inception, Melkor wanted to claim Arien as a wife, but when she refused him, he attempted to ravish her. However, she released her spirit and burned Melkor leaving him ashen and grey. The Sun was then left without a guide and caused uneven seasons and periods of excessive heat or cold in Arda. In other abandoned writings, she was a Maia of Varda. 
It was told that Arien (Urwendi) and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into Fôs Almir, a bath of flame that would make one pure.
==Etymology==
Arien means "Maiden of Sunlight" in Quenya. It is derived from the root as-, seen also in Áre "sunlight", arien and -ien feminine suffix.
