Avarin is a term used to refer to the combined languages of the Avari.
==Structure==
There were at least six different languages, or dialects, in the Avarin group., Note 9, p. 410 The various dialects did not have a common development,, pp. 18-28 although all descended from Primitive Quendian.
Three larger divisions of Avarin are recorded: West Avarin, North Avarin and East Avarin. The West Avarin group was nearest to the Eldarin languages of the west; North Avarin was very peculiar, with no initial consonant groups. Not much is known of East Avarin.
==Other versions==
The Avarin were called Lemberin tongues which originally intended to have a resemblance in sound to Goidelic, Baltic, and Finnic languages.David Salos http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36029 post in Elfling
