Rushey was a small village south of the Marish, in the Eastfarthing of the Shire. It was built on a relatively stable ground amidst the soggy fens of the Marish, hence the name. The Causeway traversed the village, connecting it to the villages of Stock to the north and Deephallow to the south. 
==Etymology==
The name means "Rush-isle". David Salo has suggested an Old English etymology from *Ryscieg. Wiktionary:ey#Old_Norse or -y in English place-names has the sense "small island", as seen in Girdley.
It was called so as "a hard among the fens of the Marish", p. 775 forming an isolated "island" in the midst of the soggy ground; this nomenclature is also seen in the Wikipedia:Isle of Ely. 
The name is spelled as "Rushy" on A Part of the Shire.
