Araman was the northern coastland of Aman, north of Valinor, that lay outside the mountain-fence of the Pelóri. It was deserted, mountainous and frozen because of its neighbouring with Helcaraxë which joined it with Beleriand.
==History==
This was the way Morgoth (passing through Oiomúrë), and later the Noldor took into Exile.  In Araman the host of the Noldor heard the Doom of Mandos, delivered by a dark figure standing upon a high rock.  Upon hearing the prophecy the host divided, with the followers of Fëanor pressing onward while those of Finarfin turned back.  Later, when Fëanor and his kin burnt their ships at Losgar, Fingolfin in Araman knew that he had been betrayed and that their only course was to march across the Helcaraxë.
==Etymology==
Araman is Quenya for "outside Aman", consisting of Ar#Quenya + Aman#Etymology., entries ar- and mān-
