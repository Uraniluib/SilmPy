The Bracegirdle Family were an important and populous family of Shire-hobbits, associated with the town or village of Hardbottle. The most famous of them was Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, who married Otho Sackville-Baggins.
==Etymology==
The Hobbitish name referred to their tendency to be fat and so to strain their belts, meaning "Tight-belt", or "Belt-tightener / strainer / stretcher". Bracegirdle is a real-life English surname. J.R.R. Tolkien had noted that it followed the type of Romance compounds with the verbal element first (instead of *"Girdlebracer")., p. 754
