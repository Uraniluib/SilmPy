Dailir was the name of the arrow used by Beleg with his bow, Belthronding.  After shooting this arrow Beleg always found it unharmed.  However, it was broken at last when Beleg fell upon it when he was carrying TÃºrin.
==Etymology==
dailir is glossed "cleaver" in the Noldorin Word-lists, and is related to the Noldorin verb daila- "to cleave" and the noun dail "axe-blade". The -ir suffix creates an "agent noun" (such as adding r to bite in English produces biter). p. 141, note 6, p. 564
