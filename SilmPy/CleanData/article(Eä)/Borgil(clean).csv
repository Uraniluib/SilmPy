Borgil was a bright red star near the constellation of Menelvagor.
==Etymology==
Borgil is a Sindarin name, composed of born "hot, red" and gil "star".
==Inspiration==
Tolkien fandom have suggested that Borgil might either refer to the star wikipedia:Betelgeuse or the star wikipedia:Aldebaran.
Basing her approach both on literary assumptions and astronomical evidences, Prof. Kristine Larsen has argued that Borgil can be identified as Aldebaran.Kristine Larsen, "A Definitive Identification of Tolkien’s `Borgil: An Astronomical and Literary Approach" in Tolkien Studies, vol.
