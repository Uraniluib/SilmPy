Trollshaws were the upland woods, consisting at least partly of Beeches trees, that lay to the west of Rivendell between the Rivers Hoarwell and Bruinen.
On the hills of the Trollshaws were shallow caves, such as the Trolls Cave, and Mannish castles and towers.
==History==
Trollshaws were within the borders of Arnor and later of the smaller realm of Rhudaur. The Men of Rhudaur built castles and towers on the top of some of its hills.
They were the haunt of Trolls, especially after the fall of Arnor; Stone-trolls from "the mountains" came to the woodlands. This was the case of William who led Tom and Bert; having eaten a village and a half on their way, they complained about the scarcity of people in the area and instead had to make do with mutton. While they made their camp, they famously waylaid Bilbo Baggins and Thorin and Company who were on their Quest of Erebor. Thanks to the distractions of Gandalf, the Trolls were turned to stone by the Sun. Years later, Frodo Baggins and his companions traversed the woodland and found the Trolls petrified forms on the way to Rivendell.
==Etymology==
Shaws is an archaic word meaning "thicket, wood".
The woods geographically belonged to where the ancient realm of Rhudaur used to be, and were perhaps named after it; Rhudaur means "troll-shaws" in Westron.
