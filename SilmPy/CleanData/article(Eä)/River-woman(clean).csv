The River-woman was a mysterious person — apparently some kind of Spirits (creatures) — associated with the Withywindle in the Old Forest.  She was the mother of Goldberry, who was for this reason known as the "River-daughter".  
In a poem, Tom Bombadil was pulled into the river by the swimming Goldberry she swam "back to her mothers house in the deepest hollow". Later, Tom returned to the river and asked the River-woman for Goldberrys hand; she complied unquestionably, so the two were married.
