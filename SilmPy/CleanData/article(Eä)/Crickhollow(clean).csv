Crickhollow was a location, perhaps a small settlement in Buckland, located a short way to the northeast of Brandy Hall. 
Its most notable spot was an isolated house standing back from the lane in the middle of a wide lawn. It was surrounded by low trees inside an outer hedge, and there were no other dwellings nearby. This house was occasionally occupied with Brandybuck Family Hobbits who grew tired of the often crowded Brandy Hall.
==History==
Frodo Baggins was instructed by Gandalf to find a reason why he should leave Hobbiton (and the Shire) and meet him in Bree. In the summer of , Frodo Baggins bought this house, as an excuse for leaving Hobbiton to the east.

While Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took moved out, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Fredegar Bolger were already in that house, making preparations for their arrival. They were the only Hobbits who knew that Frodo would begin a journey to the east, so they made preparation for their departure as well.
On 25 September, Frodo and his company arrived at the lodgings, and met Merry and Fatty. The next day Frodo and his party departed for the Old Forest. It was decided that Fatty would stay at Crickhollow to maintain the pretense that Frodo was still in residence to hide his departure. Frodo spent only one night; at 26 September they picked up the ponies from a nearby stable and rode to the High Hay.
In the early hours of 30 September three Nazgûl came to the house in Crickhollow, but Fatty Bolger had already escaped.  He had run to the nearest house and from there he spread news of an invasion, which traveled swiftly to Brandy Hall, and resulted in the rousing of the hobbits of Buckland.
After the War of the Ring, Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkien noted that the first element is obsolete and of obscure meaning. A hollow is a small depression in the ground., p. 768
Based on this, David Salo has suggested a speculative Old English form *Crycholh from which Crickhollow derives. The obscure element cryc could represent, as can be expected in Stoorish, a Celtic (Wikipedia:British language) word for "hill". The placename would therefore mean "low place by the hill".
It is not clear in the Lord of the Rings whether Crickhollow was a village or a region occupied by a solitary house. The Encyclopedia of Arda mentions Crickhollow as a village. Robert Foster describes Crickhollow as a "place in Buckland"Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 75, entry "Crickhollow" whereas Karen Fonstad believes that Crickhollow is just the name of Frodos house.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 120
