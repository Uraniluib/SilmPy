The King of Khazad-dûm (Sindarin: Aran Moria) was typically the Kings of Durins Folk who also ruled Moria, the greatest Dwarves kingdom of the Longbeards clan. 
Founded in the Years of the Trees by Durin, the kingdom lasted for thousands of years before its people were driven into exile by a Balrog in . The defeat of Durins Bane and Sauron in the War of the Ring might have allowed Durin VII to reclaim their ancestral home sometime in the Fourth Age.
==List of known Kings==
While sixty or more kings might have ruled Khazad-dûm through the ages, only nine have been recorded:
* Durin - the founder and first King of Khazad-dûm in the First Age.
* Durin II - during whose time the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm traded with Men of the Vales of Anduin.
* Durin III - who was a friend of the Elves of Ost-in-Edhil and was given the first of the Seven Rings by Celebrimbor. He later sealed the Doors of Durin when Sauron destroyed Ost-in-Edhil in .
* Durin IV (presumably)
* Durin V (presumably)
* Durin VI - the king whose Dwarves delved to deep into the earth in their search for mithril and awoke a Durins Bane. He was killed shortly after its release in .
* Náin I - who was king for less than a year before he too was killed by the Balrog. Durins folk then fled their ancestral home and Khazad-dûm became known as Moria, the "Black Pit".
*(Balin led a Balins Colony that attempted to retake Moria in . Balin was a descendent of Durin, but not of the senior male line of descent, while the King of Durins Folk was Dáin Ironfoot. As such, Balin ruled only as Lord of Moria and only for five years.)
* Durin VII - said to have returned to Moria and refounded Khazad-dûm in the Fourth Age.
