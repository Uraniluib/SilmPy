An Orcs, addressed as Snaga, was part of the garrison of the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Cirith Ungol on 14 March .
Snaga was running down the stairs of the tower when he encountered what he thought was a "Samwise Gamgee" on the stairs.  Spinning around, he fled back the way he came.  The "Great Elf-warrior" was actually Samwise Gamgee who followed the Orc, although being tired he fell behind his foe.
Snaga came upon Shagrat, who ordered him to send word to Sauron that they captured a Frodo Baggins. Snaga refused, and after a short chase, made his way to the top of the tower. There, he lashed the prisoner, Frodo Baggins, with a whip. He was quickly overcome by Samwise Gamgee, and fell through the trap door to his death.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:Two Orcs appear in the role of Snaga, though none are called or credited as such. Sam encounters one on the stairs, who runs, trips and falls to his doom. A second orc is lashing Frodo. After a short fight, he too falls to his doom.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series): 
:Snaga was voiced by Gordon Reid.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
:Like in the animated film, Snagas role is seemingly filled by more than one Orc. First, Sam encounters a trio of Uruk-hai on the stairs, before slaying all three of them. Later, Gorbag (who survives the battle in this adaptation) fulfills the latter role as the Orc that threatens Frodo before being killed by Sam.
