==Etymology and analysis==

The phrase is translated as "Lord of Moria"; uzbad seems to be translated as "Lord", however since Khuzdul words of three consonants normally dont begin with a vowel, Magnus Åberg proposes that the word is enclitic, and *u- is actually a prefix meaning "and".http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish by Magnus Åberg
If this is so, uzbad is meaning "...and lord", the full phrase being "...son of Fundin and lord...". Åberg suggests that the basic form of "Lord" would be *zâbad and "Lord of Moria" would be *zâbad Khazaddûmu.
The ending -u in Khazaddûmu is probably "an ending that gives the noun an objective or locative meaning".
