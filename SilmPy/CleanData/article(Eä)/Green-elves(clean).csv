The Green-elves (Quenya Green-elves#Etymology, Sindarin Green-elves#Etymology; also Green Elves, p. 349) were a clan of the Nandor.
==History==
Lenwë was an Elves of the Telerin clan, who set out with the Great Journey of the Elves into the West. When his people found their path blocked by the Misty Mountains, he resolved to leave the Journey and instead led his followers south down the Vales of Anduin, and they became known as the Nandor. After many years, Lenwës son Denethor of the Nandor set out westward once again, and led some part of the Nandor across the Misty Mountains and the Blue, settling at last in the Ossiriand beneath the Ered Luin; the land called Ossiriand.

Denethor and his followers did not have peace for long. Soon after his return to Middle-earth, before the Noldor had followed him, Morgoth loosed armies of orcs on King Thingol and his allies, Círdan in the west and Denethor in the east. Denethors Nandor were ill-equipped for warfare, and suffered great hardship in that battle. Denethor himself was slain on Amon Ereb, though the Elves beat back the orcs at last. After that time many of Denethors people left Ossiriand for the guarded forests of Doriath: these settled in Arthórien and became known as the Guest-elves., pp. 112-3 Those few that remained took up a secretive existence, camouflaging themselves in green. From that time, they were known as the Green-elves.
The hidden people of the Green-elves played little part in history after the First Battle of the Wars of Beleriand. Most significantly, they lent their aid to Beren and Dior (who dwelt on Tol Galen in the far south of their land). After the loss of their ancient ally Thingol at the hands of the Dwarves, they went with Beren to avenge him. Much later, after the deaths of Beren and Lúthien, one of their lords took up the Silmarils that Lúthien had borne, and brought it to Menegroth where Dior now dwelt.
After the end of the First Age, their fate is not clearly known. Much of their land survived the destruction of Beleriand, and as Lindon came under the rule of Gil-galad. Some at least seem to have removed to Eriador, and dwelled on the shores of Lake Evendim during the Second AgeA note in the Unfinished Tales. After this, nothing is known of their fate.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name Laegrim (class plural; sing Laegel, pl Laegil) or Laegel(d)rim, meaning "Green-elves", was a name used by the Sindar of Beleriand for the inhabitants of Ossiriand and Lindon. This term was translated by the Noldor to Quenya Laiquendi., p. 385While J.R.R. Tolkien states in the late manuscript Quendi and Eldar (ca. 1959-60) that the Quenya form Laiquendi "was not much used" (p. 385), it is the only Elvish translation of "Green-elves" which occurs in the published The Silmarillion.
In the The Etymologies appears early Elvish names for the Green-elves: Qenya Laiqendi and Noldorin Lhoebenidh or Lhoebelidh., p. 368 (Sundocarme LÁYAK)
