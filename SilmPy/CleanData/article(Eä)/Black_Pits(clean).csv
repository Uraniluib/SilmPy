The Black Pits were dungeons of torment under Barad-d√ªr., p. 603 They were known to Shagrat who cursed "The Black Pits take that filthy rebel Gorbag!" after the two orc companies had had a disastrous fight in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
Shagrat also told his underling Snaga (orc of Mordor) that they both would "be for the Black Pits" if the news of the happenings in the Tower would not get through to Sauron.
