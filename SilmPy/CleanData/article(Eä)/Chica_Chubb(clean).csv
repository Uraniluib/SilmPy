Chica Baggins, née Chubb, was a Hobbit of the Shire.
==History==
Chica was the daughter of the head of the Chubb family. As her family name would have become lost after her marriage to Bingo Baggins, her offspring received a double surname, Chubb-Baggins. Their son Falco Chubb-Baggins was the first to bear that name.
