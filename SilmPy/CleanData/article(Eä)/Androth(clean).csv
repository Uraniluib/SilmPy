Androth (Sindarin, from and = "long" and roth = "cave") was the name of a complex of caves in the Mithrim. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"), Annael led some of the Sindar and Edain that survived the battle to the caves and took refuge there. Tuor was fostered by the Elves of Androth until they left for the Havens of Sirion in . Later he returned to lie there as an outlaw.
