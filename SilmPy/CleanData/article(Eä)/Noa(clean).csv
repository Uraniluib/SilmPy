noa is Quenya word. J.R.R. Tolkien reversed its meaning over the years: (1) one manuscript has "ekuva nin kare sa noa", translated as "I may do that tomorrow", where noa is "tomorrow"; (2) another manuscript gives noa yesterday, from the expression noa rÄ“ ("former day")., p. 34 (note 23)
Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the form noa, analyzed "basically an adjective" (with the meaning "former" or "yesterday") could be valid Neo-Quenya.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 25 June 2011)
