Taur-en-Faroth was the range of wooded hills in West Beleriand that rose up above the western side of the River Narog. They were part of the Realm of Nargothrond.
The hills themselves were the western end of the Andram. It was among these hills that the stream of Ringwil rose and cascaded down into the main river. In their steep eastern sides above the Narog, there was a network of caverns.
In ancient times, these Caverns of Narog known as Nulukkizdîn, had been home to Petty-dwarves who dwelt there in secret before the arrival of Finrod. What became of the Petty-Dwarves at this time is not recorded, but at least some escaped to dwell in Amon Rûdh.
