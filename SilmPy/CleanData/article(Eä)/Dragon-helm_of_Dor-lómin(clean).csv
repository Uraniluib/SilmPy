The Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, also known as the Helm of Hador, was a visored steel helm, embossed and embellished with gold and runes, that bore as its crest an image of the head of Glaurung. It was said to bear an enchantment that protected its wearer from wounds and struck fear into the hearts of enemies.
== History ==
The helm was forged sometime after  by the Dwarves-smith Telchar for his lord Azaghâl, who then gave it as a gift to Maedhros. He in turn passed it on to his cousin Fingon. In  Fingolfin, the High King of the Noldor, created the fiefdom of Dor-lómin and made Hador the first Lord of Dor-lómin. To celebrate the event Fingon presented Hador with the helm.
The Dragon-helm was crafted for a Dwarf and was too large and heavy for an Elves. Even Men found the helm was too massive, and only Hador and some of his descendants had the strength to wear it. He and his son Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin) wore it often in combat, and their troops gained morale when they saw the massive crest towering over the other helms in battle. Unfortunately, Galdor didnt wear the helm when a host of orcs assaulted Eithel Sirion, and was slain by an arrow. His son Húrin kept the helm but seldom wore it, being of shorter stature and greater pride. It passed through Hadors descendants until Túrin finally bore it to battle. 
Túrin was monstrous in war and took one of his many titles from it: Gorthol, the "Dread Helm". The last clear record of the Dragon-helm is at the Battle of Tumhalad, where Túrin is known to have worn it.
