Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! was a Khuzdul battlecry. 
==History==
Though the battle-cry was much older, the first recorded use was in the Battle of the Hornburg: 
But a Gimli that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Orcs fell headless. The rest fled.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, "Helms Deep (chapter)"
Later, Gimli gave some variations on the battle-cry: Khazâd! Khazâd! and Khazâd ai-mênu!. 
==Etymology==
The cry is translated "Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!".J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F, I: The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age; Of Dwarves
