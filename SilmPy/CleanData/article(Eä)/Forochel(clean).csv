Forochel was one of the regions of the Northern Waste. It was the name of the icy tundra in the northern parts of Middle-earth, and especially of the great Icebay of Forochel and the lands that surrounded it.
Like the rest of the Northern Waste, the source of Forochels everlasting cold was an after-effect of Morgoths Dor Daidelos that once existed there in the Elder Days. Even after the fall of the first Dark Lord and his realm, the lands of the north retained their freezing temperatures.
It was inhabited by the Lossoth, a hardy tribe of Men descended from the Forodwaith (people). Most Men of the region lived on the Cape of Forochel near the Great Sea of Belegaer but some built their villages on the shores of the Icebay itself.
==Etymology==
The name is Sindarin and means "northern ice", composed of forod "north" and *hel, a possible Sindarin word meaning "ice" (cf. KHELEK and the struck-out Noldorin word hell "frost", p. 364 (root appearing as "KHEL-")).

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Forochel is one of the regions of the game, accessed via the northern end of Evendim. The language and culture of its people, the Lossoth, are modeled after the Finnish. An aurora borealis effect can be seen in the sky. Prior to the release of Western Gondor, it was the only region in the game world where the ocean was visible, but players will freeze to death if attempting to swim in it.
