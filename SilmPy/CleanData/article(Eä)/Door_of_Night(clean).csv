Image:John Howe - The Door of Night.jpg - The Door of NightThe Door of Night was a guarded portal in the distant Uttermost West, through which Morgoth was cast after his defeat in the War of Wrath. Its origins are unclear: according to some accounts, it was made by the Valar as a passage for the Sun, which would return into the World through the Gates of Morning in the east. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway through which to expel Morgoth.
The Door of Night was guarded by Eärendil, bearing his Silmarils aloft in his shining ship Vingilot.
