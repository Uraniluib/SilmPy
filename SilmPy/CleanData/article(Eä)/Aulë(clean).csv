Aulë (Quenya, pronounced ) was a Valar and one of the Aratar, also known as the the Smith and Smith of the Valar, concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft. 
==Attributes==
Aulë governs the substances of the Ambar and he delights in all works and crafts all of which he is master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals. 
He enjoyed his skill of devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like Melkor, as Ilúvatar gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Aule was always faithful to Eru and submitted all his creations to His will. He was never jealous of others creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed in the things he made and in the making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Melkor who envied him; Melkor always marred his work and Aule always sought to repair them.
He was the third most powerful of the Aratar. He was husband to Yavanna, with whom he Mansions of Aulë in central Valinor.
Several Maiar were associated with Aulë: Sauron, before being corrupted by Morgoth and becoming Sauron; and Saruman, who later went to Middle-earth as an Istar to combat Sauron.
==History==
In the Song of the Ainur Aule thought most of the fabric of the Earth. During the creation of Arda, Aulë worked much with Manwe and Ulmo; Aule fashioned the substances that composed Ambar, and was most involved in building the continents and mountains. As he was much like Melkor, there was strife between them and he grew weary repairing the tumults and disorders caused by Melkor on his work. One of his Maiar, Mairon, would be ensnared by his enemy in those early strifes.
When Osse was also seduced by Melkor, Aule pleaded to Uinen to calm and restrain him, and so the Maia returned to his master Ulmo.

He constructed Angainor, the chain of Morgoth, the lamps Illuin and Ormal and the vessels of the Sun and Moon. 
Aulë created his own race of beings, the Dwarves, because he was unwilling to wait for the Children of Ilúvatar to appear. Ilúvatar knew of this and even as Aulë was instructing them He chastened Aulë. Aulë humbly repented, offering his children to the will of Ilúvatar, whom He accepted as His adopted children. Since Ilúvatar had decided that the Elves were to be the first-born race, He made the Dwarves to sleep until the Elves Awakening of the Elves on Arda.
