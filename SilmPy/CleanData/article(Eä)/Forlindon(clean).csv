Forlindon was a name for the northern part of Lindon, north of the Gulf of Lune and west of the Blue Mountains. The land was traversed by a river which ended on the northern shore of the Gulf; the haven of Forlond was built there, on its mouths. Off its north-western coasts stood the island of Himring, where Maedhross fortress had once stood.
==History==
Prior to the Great Battle the land of Lindon had been part of Ossiriand; afterwards the remnant was called Lindon, split into Forlindon and Harlindon by the newly created Gulf of Lune.
Gil-Galad lived in Forlindon in the Second Age.
==Etymology==
The name Forlindon likely means "North Lindon",, p. 30 (note 47) apparently derived from forn (Sindarin; "right, north") + Lindon#Etymology.http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth at http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com (accessed 22 October 2011)
