The Andrath was a defile between the Barrow-downs (to the west) and the South Downs (to the east) in Eriador.  Through this narrow way just south of Bree passed the North-South Road (Greenway).
==History==
When the Nazgûl came up the Greenway in search of the The One Ring the Witch-king established a camp at Andrath.  From there he sent some Riders out to patrol while he visited the Barrow-downs.
==Etymology==
Andrath means "Long Climb", apparently consisting of the Sindarin elements and + rath#Sindarin.http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth at http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com (accessed 20 July 2011)
