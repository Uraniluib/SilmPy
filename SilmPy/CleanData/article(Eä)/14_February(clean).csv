In editions prior to the The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition), the Appendix B mentions two events on this day in : Gandalf returning to life, and the Mirror of Galadriel-sequence. Since it is clear from the narrative that the latter event occurred one day before departure on 16 February, this causes a problem in the chronology. Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull decided to fix the Tale of Years so that the Mirror of Galadriel-sequence happened on 15 February. The return to life of Gandalf was also moved to this date, for reasons unclear.
