Gurthang was the sword of Túrin, reforged from Anglachel the sword wielded by Beleg when Túrin slew him in a tragic turn of events. 
It was black and shone with a pale fire. With it Túrin performed great deeds but also senseless acts.
==History==
Túrin was led to Nargothrond by Gwindor who had aided Beleg in the rescue. Once in Nargothrond Túrin had Anglachel forged anew. He renamed the blade Gurthang, "Iron of Death". The sword was wielded by Túrin throughout his time at Nargothrond as he became a captain and led the Nargothrondrim into open warfare, a tactic they were not well versed in. His increasing fame with Gurthang gave Túrin a new name: Mormegil The Black Sword of Nargothrond. Túrins exploits with the Nargothrondrim culminated with the Battle of Tumhalad which led to the ruin of Nargothrond.
Gurthang was used by Túrin to slay the Easterlings chief Brodda and it remained with him when he came to Brethil but wishing to be rid of his past he put Gurthang away. Only when orcs started to threaten Brethil in numbers did Túrin once again take up Gurthang to repulse them. When Glaurung came to Brethil pursuing Túrin, a desperate council was held in Ephel Brandir as to how to deal with the threat. Túrin told the Haladin of the tale of Azaghâl Lord of Belegost and how his knife forced Glaurung to flee, Túrin then declared "But here is a thorn sharper and longer than the knife of Azaghâl" and the Haladin cried out "The Black Thorn of Brethil!"
Túrin succeeded in slaying Glaurung with Gurthang at Cabed-en-Aras but fell into a swoon when he wrested it from Glaurungs belly. He was then told by Brandir that his wife was in fact his sister Nienor as recounted by Glaurung and in a rage slew Brandir. Discovering from Mablung that this was in fact true Túrin returned to Cabed-en-Aras to commit suicide addressing Gurthang with courteous words: 
" Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly? " 
"And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly. "Unless one interprets Gurthangs answer as occuring solely within Túrins mind, there exists another item in the legendarium which shows an ability to speak: the talking purse of the troll William.
Túrin cast himself upon Gurthang and the blade broke asunder. It was buried with Túrin beneath the Stone of the Hapless and there ends its history.
