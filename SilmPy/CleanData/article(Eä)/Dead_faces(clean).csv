__NOTOC__

The dead faces, or candles of corpses, were apparitions of Ghosts faces of dead Elves, Men, and Orcs warriors in the Mere of Dead Faces in the Dead Marshes. The faces, rotting and twisted, with weed caught in their hair, appeared in dark waters being lit by pale and fell lights, as from unseen candles.
How the dead warriors came to be transformed into such undead beings is unknown, but Frodo Baggins speculated about "devilry hatched in the Dark Land", likely referring to Saurons dark arts in the nearby Mordor.
==Etymology==
A corpse candle is defined as a "luminous appearance, resembling the flame of a candle, sometimes seen in churchyards and other damp places, superstitiously regarded as portending death".
For a poem, J.R.R. Tolkien created the Qenya phrase ve kaivo-kalma, meaning "as a corpse-candle"., p. 85
