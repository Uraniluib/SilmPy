The Dark Land, also referred to as the South Land, was a continent that lay in south-east Arda. 
==History==
The Dark Land was created as a by-product of the War for the Sake of the Elves, in which the Valar overthrew Melkor in his original fortress of Utumno., pp. 293-294, p. 305 Originally, Middle-earth was one landmass, set between the western sea of Belegaer and the East Sea. This changed during the War; the inland Sea of Ringil, originally set in the mid-south of Middle-earth, grew in size and "became a great sea flowing north-eastward and joining by straights both the Western and Eastern Seas." This event split Middle-earth into two landmasses, and the landmass to the south and east of the former of Sea of RingilConfusingly, the former Sea of Ringil was also called the "East Sea" by Tolkien on one early map. See . was known as the Dark Land.
No inhabitants of the Dark Land were ever recorded. The Dark Land may have been part of the Empty Lands that Ilúvatar "cast back" during the Downfall of Númenor., p. 32 ("If this region the Empty Lands ... is to be related to Ambarkanta Map V it must be what is there called the Burnt Land of the Sun; perhaps also the Dark Land.")
==Inspiration==
The Dark Land is named only in an early map by J.R.R. Tolkien, likely dating to the mid-1930s., pp. 9, 108, p. 42
Tolkien fandom have suggested and discussed different theories of inspiration behind the Dark Land:
*the Dark Land as reminiscent of Wikipedia:Lemuria (continent).http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/35418 Message 35418 (dated 8 May 2009) at Elfling (accessed 20 October 2011)
*the Dark Land as perhaps representing a combination of both Australia and Antarctica (because of its geographic position)."http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=212156 Dark Land...a continent south of Middle Earth?" at http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/default.asp The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza Forum (accessed 20 October 2011)
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1982-97: Middle-earth Role Playing:
:Although never fleshed out in much detail, a "dark continent" called Mórenorë is said to be situated south of Middle-earth, separated by the sea of Haragaer., pp. 7, 9 A few glimpses of this remote continent, however, were provided: 
*A black cold-drake, Naikamil, fled from mountains in the south of Endor to Mórenorë after killing her mate., p. 102 
*Ungoliant, a monster of the Elder Days, is said to have "settled in the shadowy reaches of Morenórë, the Dark Continent",Inspired by a passage in The Silmarillion, which says that Ungoliant went "into the forgotten south of the world", after having dwelt at Nan Dungortheb (cf. "Of the Flight of the Noldor"). according to tales of the Avari Elves., p. 117
*Ninko Goldmaster, a mysterious merchant appearing as a character in an adventure setting, is rumoured to have visited distant lands, including Mórenorë., p. 117
In his work Parma Endorion, Michael Martinez coined the term Hyarmenor to refer to the Dark Land.
