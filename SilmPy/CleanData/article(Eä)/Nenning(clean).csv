Nenning was a river of western Beleriand that rose in an isolated hilly region south of the Ered Wethrin, and flowed southwards to meet the sea at Eglarest, one of the two great Havens of the Falas. It was considered to be the border between Círdans lands to the west and the realm of Nargothrond to the east.
In the year after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Morgoth sent columns of Orcs down the rivers Brithon and Nenning to attack the Havens. They were successful, capturing the havens and enslaving most of Círdans folk.
