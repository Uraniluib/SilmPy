Nen Lalaith was a babbling stream that rose under the mountain of Amon Darthir in the Ered Wethrin, and flowed north-westwards out onto the shaded plains of Dor-lómin. There, it trickled past the house of Húrin, and was said to have given its name to his ill-fated young daughter, Lalaith.
==Etymology==
Nen Lalaith means "Water of Laughter" in Sindarin (from nen = "river, water" and Lalaith (word) = "laughter").
