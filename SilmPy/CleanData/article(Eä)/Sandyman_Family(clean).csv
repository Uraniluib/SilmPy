The Sandyman Family was a family of Hobbits from Hobbiton. They operated the Old Mill.
==History==
The Sandyman family did not get along well with some of the other Hobbiton families, especially the Gamgee Family. Gaffer Gamgee did not like Sandyman, nor did his son Samwise Gamgee like millers son Ted Sandyman, who collaborated with Lotho Sackville-Baggins and Saruman during the War of the Ring.
