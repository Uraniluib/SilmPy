Vinyamar (Quenya, pron. ) was a settlement built by Turgon in Nevrast, on the slopes of Mount Taras, early in the Exile of the Noldor. It was perched upon high terraces that looked towards the sea. It was never visited by the servants of Morgoth but after its abandonment it became weathered. Turgons great hall had its walls and roof covered with a deep growth of plants.
==History==
Vinyamar was the first recorded Noldor stone construction after they had returned to Middle-earth. Vinyamars population was primarily Noldorin, with a large influx of Sindarin elves.
In  Turgon and Finrod took a journey along the river Sirion. At the Meres of Twilight they slept and both received a dream from Ulmo, bidding them to see places of strength. Two years later Turgon discovered the hidden way and vale of Tumladen wherein he determined to build Gondolin. In  Turgon led a third of his people to the valley to begin construction of his hidden city. By  Gondolin was full-wrought and Turgon led the remainder of his folk to the city; from then on Vinyamar was abandoned and fell into decay.
Much later, in , Tuor came to the deserted settlement. Marvelling, he entered Turgons old hall and on a wall, lit by the setting sun, he found a shield, hauberk, helm, and sword. The shield bore a filed of blue and a white swans wing. Tuor took these items and wore them. In the meantime, VoronwÃ« was rescued by Ulmo from a shipwreck and was brought near the city; when the two met, they left Vinyamar together for a journey that led to Gondolin.
