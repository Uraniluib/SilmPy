In the early versions of J.R.R. Tolkiens legendarium (see: The Book of Lost Tales Part One), the Falmari were known as Solosimpi ("Pipers of the Shores"), while the name Teleri was given to the clan of Elves known as the Vanyar.
Their leader was Thingol but after he was lost, they chose Ellu., p. 132
The Solosimpi dwelt in Alqualondë but many were Kinslaying at Alqualondë by the Gnomes under Fëanor., p. 234
