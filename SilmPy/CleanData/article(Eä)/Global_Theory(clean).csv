Global Theory is an alternative way of understanding Tolkiens legendarium suggested by David Giraudeau after a concept by Edouard Kloczko. 
According to this theory, all of Tolkiens work can be understood as a single continuity, no matter the inconsistencies or alterations, having in mind both his early mythological works (eg. The Book of Lost Tales Part One) and the later (The Lord of the Rings). 
For example the theory suggests that the Book of Lost Tales should be understood to have happened in the Middle Ages, long after the prehistorical happenings of the books; the Qenya and Gnomish words and names are medieval evolution of the "earlier" Quenya and Sindarin of the Elder Days.
All inconsistencies can be dismissed by crediting them to errors or misunderstandings of the copyists, including Eriol.
