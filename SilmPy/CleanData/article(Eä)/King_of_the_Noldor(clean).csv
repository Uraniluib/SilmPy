King of the Noldor was a title held by some of the rulers of the Noldor, though others used the title High King of the Noldor.
==History==
===Founding of the kingship===
The Noldor, that part of the Tatyar Elves who participated in the Great Journey, were led by Finwë. Finwë was one of the three elves summoned to Valinor by Oromë to serve as messengers to their fellows, and later became the ruler of the Noldor in Valinor, who lived in the city of Tirion. He was known as the King of the Noldor, and had three sons from two marriages.
Finwë followed his eldest son Fëanor into exile at Formenos, and was killed by Morgoth following the Darkening of Valinor. Following his fathers death, Fëanor returned to Tirion even though the Valar had not lifted his exile. This cast Fëanors inheritance of the kingship into question, but the rhetorical skill of Fëanor convinced the majority of the Noldor to follow him in his Flight of the Noldor against the Valar, rendering the question moot.
===Title splits===
After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, the youngest son of Finwë, Finarfin, repented of the rebellion and was permitted to return to Tirion because his people had played no part in the Kinslaying. He subsequently became the King of the Noldor in Valinor. However, the hosts of Fëanor, the primary instigator of the Kinslaying, and Fingolfin, some of whose people were late participants in it, continued towards Middle-earth.
===Noldorin rulers in Beleriand===
The hosts of Fëanor and Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth separately, following Fëanors betrayal of his half-brother by burning their captured fleet at Losgar, with Fëanor arriving first. Fëanor, while calling himself King of the Noldor, was killed in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath before he was able to establish a realm. His eldest son, Maedhros, presumably inherited his titles, but was soon after captured by Morgoth.
The arrival of the host of Fingolfin, battered by the crossing of the Helcaraxë, complicated matters, as Fëanors betrayal had driven a rift between the two hosts. This was resolved by Fingon, son of Fingolfin, rescuing Maedhros from his captivity in Thangorodrim. Maedhros subsequently apologised for the burning of the ships and ceded his claim to the kingship, and that of the entire House of Fëanor, to Fingolfin, despite the disagreement of some of Sons of Feanor.
Subsequently, Fingolfin was named King of the Noldor in Beleriand. With the establishment of many different Noldorin realms, this title soon became High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth. Following Fingolfins death in the Dagor Bragollach, the title passed to his son Fingon. Following Fingons death in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the title passed to his younger brother Turgon.
===Later history of the kingship===
Following Turgons death in the Fall of Gondolin, there were no more extant Noldorin realms in Beleriand. However, the young Gil-galad was named High King once news of Turgons death had spread. In the published version of The Silmarillion, Gil-galad is said to be the son of Fingon. However, in some of Tolkiens later notes, published in The History of Middle-earth, Gil-galad is said to be the son of Orodreth and thus a junior member of the House of Finarfin, and Turgons closest living relative in the male line (excluding the dispossessed House of Fëanor).
After the cataclysmic War of Wrath that ended the First Age, the surviving Noldor who did not depart for the Undying Lands constituted the realms of Lindon and Eregion in northwestern Middle-earth. Gil-galad continued to reign as High King, though as in the First Age this title brought little real authority beyond the kings own direct realm. However, Gil-galad was the commander of almost all of the Elven forces who fought in the War of the Last Alliance.
After Gil-galads death in that war, the title of High King was no longer used. He had fathered no children, and there were no other male line descendants of Finwë living in Middle-earth at that time. The Noldorin population of Middle-earth was greatly diminished in the Third Age, but Elrond functioned in a similar role to Gil-galad throughout the Age.
