Arthedain was one of the three realms of the Dúnedain of Arnor created from the fragmentation of the kingdom of Arnor. After the death of Arnors King Eärendur (King of Arnor), his sons divided the realm into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan.
==Description==
Arthedain lay primarily between the Lhûn and the Baranduin in northwestern Eriador. However, it also claimed the land north of the Great East Road from the Brandywine Bridge to the Weather Hills. Notable features within Arthedain were the Hills of Evendim, Lake Evendim, North Downs, Tower Hills, Far Downs, White Downs, the Shire, Annúminas, and Fornost Erain.
==History==
After the tenth king of Arnor, Eärendur, died in , dissensions between his sons fractured the realm. Arnor was divided into Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan. The line of Isildur was maintained in Arthedain, but in Rhudaur and Cardolan the line faded quickly. Arthedain retained Weathertop and Amon Sûl-stone Palantíri as well as Annúminas-stone Elostirion-stone, which led to contention between the three kingdoms.
When Malvegil of Arthedain became king in  Orcs began to trouble the region. Around , the Witch-king founded the kingdom of Angmar north of the Ettenmoors, soon to become the foe of Arthedain.
After Malvegil, his son Argeleb I reclaimed lordship over all of Arnor since Rhudaur and Cardolan had no living descendants of Isildur.  Rhudaur refused this claim and allied with Angmar.  Argeleb I fell in battle with Rhudaur in .  His son, Arveleg I, avenged his father by retaking the Weather Hills, aided by Lindon and Cardolan.  However, a great host issued from Angmar in , invading Arthedain and taking Weathertop. King Arveleg I was slain. Rhudaur was occupied by Angmar and Cardolan was ravaged.
In  two Fallohides brothers, Marcho and Blanco, crossed the Brandywine with many Hobbits and, with the permission of King Argeleb II, established the Shire. The Hobbits and the remaining Men in Arthedain suffered losses in the Great Plague of .
In  the Witch-king invaded Arthedain, capturing Fornost and driving most of the few Dúnedain across the Lhûn. King Arvedui held out for awhile in the North Downs until he and his guard were driven north.  Although the realm of Angmar was crushed at the Battle of Fornost in , the realm of Arthedain also came to an end and its lands remained mostly empty (except for the Shire) and its people became Rangers of the North; until the Reunited Kingdom of the northern kingdom under king Aragorn at the end of the Third Age.
