2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Orthanc and Barad-d没r are presented as The Two Towers identified in the title of the film. Tolkien himself was never certain about which two towers The Two Towers referred to; in Letter 140 noted his disapproval of the title itself but also stated that the title was deliberately ambiguous. Indeed it could refer to Orthanc and Barad-d没r, Minas Tirith and Barad-d没r, or Orthanc and Cirith Ungol.; Later Tolkien seemed to settle with Orthanc and Minas Morgul in his original design for the jacket of The Two Towers. However the producers of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers decided that, for theatrical and stylistic purposes, The Two Towers should refer to the towers of Orthanc and Barad-d没r.
