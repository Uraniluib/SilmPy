Ithilien (Sindarin, pron. ) was a region and fiefdom of Gondor. 
==History==
Historians in Gondor believed that, in the First Age, the Drúedain reached the region and were the first to cross the Anduin (probably near Cair Andros).

Amon Dîn was used as a fortified outpost of Minas Tirith keeping watch over the passage into North Ithilien from Dagorlad and any attempt by enemies to cross the Anduin near Cair Andros., p. 510 The Tower of Cirith Ungol was also defending Ithilien from attacks from Saurons remaining servants and stopped them from returning to Mordor, guarding the high pass over the Ephel Dúath. Gondor occupied the fortress until  when the Great Plague killed large parts of the population. During the plague most of the people of Osgiliath fled the city for the western dales or the woods of Ithilien.
After the disastrous Battle of the Plains in , Ithilien was the only land east of the river Anduin to be occupied as the others were abandoned.
In , Marhwini warned Calimehtar (King of Gondor) that the Wainriders were plotting to raid Calenardhon over the Undeeps. Calimehtar therefore provoked the Wainriders out of Ithilien, and his horsemen, joined by a large éored led by Marhwini, drove the Wainriders back.
In , Wainriders from Rhûn made an alliance with the Haradrim, and a dual attack on Ithilien was launched. While the Wainriders assaulted Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the Poros and invaded South Ithilien. The Gondorian Captain of the Southern Army Earnil II leading Gondors inferior Southern Army, defeated the Haradrim, and then turned north, Battle of the Camp the Wainriders into surprise and pushed many of them into the swamplands of the Dead Marshes. 
When Minas Ithil was captured by Mordor in  it was renamed Minas Morgul, the Tower of Black Sorcery. During the Watchful Peace the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the Uruk-hai, and in  these creatures assailed and overran Ithilien, captured Osgiliath and destroyed the great stone-bridge.
===Deserting===
Boromir (Steward of Gondor) defeated the host of Morgul and regained Ithilien.  However, from that time on no people dwelt in that region, and for Gondor there was never full peace again until after the defeat of Sauron.
In , Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King Folcwine of Rohan fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Steward Túrin II won a victory at the crossings of Poros, though the princes Fastred (son of Folcwine) and Folcred were slain.

The majority of the people of Ithilien fled across the Anduin to escape war (), but the Stewards of Gondor still kept scouts there, operating out of secret locations such as Henneth Annûn. Those who stayed fled to regions such as Lossarnach when Mount Doom erupted in . Steward Ecthelion II constructed the Rammas Echor as part of the now necessary defenses of Gondor., p. 546

The descendants of the people who had dwelt in Ithilien, formed the corps of the Rangers of Ithilien.
===War of the Ring and later===
During the War of the Ring, in early March , Faramir the son of the Steward Denethor, was leading the Rangers of Ithilien to ambush Haradrim who would pass through Ithilien. That same time, Gollum led Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee through Ithilien on their way to Cirith Ungol and into Mordor, and Faramir allowed them to continue when he was satisfied they were not agents of Sauron.

When the Host of the West marched on the Morannon, Mablung (ranger of Ithilien) and his troops discovered an ambush by Orcs and Easterlings that lay hid in Ithilien. The ambush was quickly turned.
During the Fourth Age, Ithilien was ruled by the Prince of Ithilien, a line that started with Faramir and Éowyn, who became known as the White Lady of Ithilien. Minas Morgul was not repopulated, and Faramir had his throne in Emyn Arnen. 
After the fall of Sauron, around , Legolas brought south Elves out of Greenwood, and they dwelt in Ithilien, and it became once again the fairest country in all the westlands. They stayed in Ithilien for "a hundred years of Men." After King Aragorn died, Legolas sailed West, reportedly taking Gimli with him, and with them left numerous other Elves.

Ithilien was the only part of Gondor on the eastern side of the Anduin, wedged in between the river and the Ephel Dúath. The northern border must have been around the Dead Marshes and its southern border was the river Poros. The region was further divided into North Ithilien and South Ithilien (the division was made at or near the Cross-roads).
Irises, Anemones, Eglantine, lilies, water-lilies and Asphodel grew in Ithilien. Lebethron and Culumalda grew especially in the woods around the Field of Cormallen., pp. 625-6 (citing from the Unfinished index) (entry for mal-)
