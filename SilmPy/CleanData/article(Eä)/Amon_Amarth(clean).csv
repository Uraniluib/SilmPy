Amon Amarth was a rarely used name for Orodruin, the flaming mountain in northern Mordor where Sauron forged the One Ring.
The name was given because the volcano was linked in ancient and little-understood prophecies with the final end of the Third Age, when the One Ring was found again., pp. 768-9
