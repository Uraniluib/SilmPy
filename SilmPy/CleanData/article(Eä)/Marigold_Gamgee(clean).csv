Marigold Cotton (née Gamgee) was the youngest child of Gaffer Gamgee.
==History==
Like all Gamgees, Marigold was close to the Cotton Family. She married Tolman Cotton Junior, the eldest son of Tolman Cotton Senior. Marigolds brother, Samwise Gamgee, married Toms sister Rose Cotton.
==Etymology==
"Marigold" (from Mary + gold) refers to the wikipedia:Tagetes annual plants of the daisy family.
J.R.R. Tolkien picked the name since it contains "gold" and referring to a golden flower, suggesting the Fallohides strain in Sams family — which, increased by the favour of Galadriel, became notable in his children., p. 760
