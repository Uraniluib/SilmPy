The only time he speaks prominently is in the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition) of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, where, after Bifur gets the axe from his head dislodged during the Battle of Five Armies, recovers it and brings it back, though Bifur declines it.
