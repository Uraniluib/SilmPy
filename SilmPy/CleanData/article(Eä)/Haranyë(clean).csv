Haranyë is a calendar term used in the context of the Kings Reckoning. It is probably the name of the last year of a century.
==Etymology==
The word is obviously Quenya, but of uncertain etymology.
Helge Fauskanger notes that Tolkiens wording does not make clear whether the word describes the "last year of a century" or a translation of "century" itself.
