 
Arminas (Royal Tower; ar = high, royal, noble, minas = tower) was an Elves of Angrods people who had lived in Dorthonion but later dwelt with Círdans folk by the Mouths of Sirion.  He and Gelmir (messenger of Círdan) were sent on a journey by Círdan as messengers and during their travels they met both Tuor and Túrin.
==History==
Arminas and Gelmir were sent by Círdan to Nargothrond after Círdan had received a message from the Valar Ulmo.  Their journey went by ship to Drengist first, to seek for the Gondolin of Turgon but they did not find it.  While journeying inland they came upon Tuor who was seeking the Gate of the Noldor and they helped him by taking him part of the way through the great tunnel., pp. 21-22
After spying upon the gathering of Orcs in the Pass of Sirion they then travelled south to deliver Ulmos message to King Orodreth.  The message was that Nargothrond should shut its doors and that the bridge before the doors should be demolished to prevent a creeping evil from finding the gate.
At this time Orodreth relied upon the counsel of Túrin, who scorned the words of the messengers, for it was upon his advice that the bridge had been built and it was his policy for the Kings forces to go forth openly to war.  Arminas then asked Túrin if he was of the House of Hador.  This question greatly angered Túrin, for in Nargothrond he wished to be known only as Agarwaen and did not want it known that the son of Húrin resided in the fortress.  In turn, Arminas became angry and upbraided Túrin for his lack of courtesy and unwillingness to listen to the advice of others.
Arminas and Gelmir then left, and their message was ignored, leading to the destruction of that citadel by Glaurung.
