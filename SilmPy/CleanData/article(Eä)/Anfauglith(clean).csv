Anfauglith was the charred desert to the north of Beleriand, created by the fires of Thangorodrim during the Dagor Bragollach ("Battle of Sudden Flame") in . It was originally the green plain of Ard-galen.  Anfauglith remained barren until after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, when one hill, the Haudh-en-Ndengin or "Hill of Slain", again was covered with long green grass.
It was upon Anfauglith that Morgoth assembled his whole power in the War of Wrath yet they were conquered by the hosts of the West.
==Etymology==
Anfauglith means "By Gasping Dust" in Sindarin (from an- = "with, by", faug = "thirsty, gasping",, faug and lith = "ash, sand, dust", lith).
Another name was Dor-nu-Fauglith translated as "Land under Choking Ash"
