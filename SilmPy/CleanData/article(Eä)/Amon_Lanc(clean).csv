Amon Lanc, the Naked Hill, was a hill in the southern parts of Mirkwood. It had once been the capital of the Woodland Realm of the Silvan Elves under Oropher in the Second Age.
Around a millennium after his Siege of Barad-dûr, Sauron came to Amon Lanc and reoccupied Orophers abandoned stronghold. The hill and fortress were then together called Dol Guldur, and the wood in which it stood became known as Mirkwood.
In the Fourth Age, southern Mirkwood became known as East Lórien and Amon Lanc obviously became part of it.
