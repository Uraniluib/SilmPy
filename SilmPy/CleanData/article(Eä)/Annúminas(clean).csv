Annúminas was the city of the Kings of Arnor before the capital of the Arnor was relocated to Fornost Erain.  The city lay on the south-east shore of Lake Evendim, near the source of the Baranduin river.  To the south and west of Annúminas rose the Hills of Evendim.
==History==
The city was founded by Elendil in  shortly after his arrival in Lindon following the destruction of Númenor., p. 176  With the establishment of Arnor the city became the capital of the realm for several centuries; and was home to the Annúminas-stone, one of the three palantíri of the North-Kingdom, and the Sceptre of Annúminas, originally the rod of office of the Númenóreans Lords of Andúnië, the heirloom of and symbol of kingship in Arnor.
Due to losses in the war against Sauron and the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, the number of the Dúnedain of Arnor began to dwindle, until eventually Annúminas was deserted and Fornost Erain became the capital.Robert Foster, in The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, suggested that the city was deserted sometime between  250 and .  The latter date is when the kingdom of Arnor fractured into three separate successor kingdoms. After  the ruins of Annúminas belonged to the petty Arnorian successor kingdom of Arthedain.
The two relics which had been housed in Annúminas survived the city: The palantír remained for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with Arvedui in the Icebay of Forochel.  The silver Sceptre of Annúminas would have been removed to Fornost by the Kings, and eventually came to be kept by Elrond in Rivendell.
At the time of the coronation of Aragorn at the end of the Third Age Annúminas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years. Yet Aragorn soon set his mind to preparing a place to stay in the ancient city. Aragorn sometimes came North to his house in Annúminas restored and stayed for a while beside Lake Evendim, and when that happened everyone in the Shire was said to be glad.
==Etymology==
The name Annúminas is Sindarin from Annûn "west", and minas "tower".

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The city of Annúminas is available for exploration and adventuring in its entirety. It is partially submerged in the waters of the lake and is overrun by servants of Angmar, who invaded the city looking for instructions to operate its palantír. A group of the Dúnedain of the North, calling themselves Wardens of Annuminas, strives to preserve the ancient city of their ancestors and its rich history, taking fight against Angmar forces, Tomb-Robbers seeking to plunder ancient relics and even the forces of nature itself when necessary. The city is situated on the hill slope and as such is presented as a multi-levelled place akin to Minas Tirith: travellers are constantly going either uphill or downhill to reach their destination. Inside the city are several market places, living quarters, pools, gardens and other artefacts of everyday life. At the highest point is the Kings Seat of power - the chamber of Ost Elendil. To the east of the city lies the Way of Kings - a row of tombs where Kings of Arnor reside, including a ceremonial Tomb of Elendil, where some of his belonging are buried in memory of the citys founder.
