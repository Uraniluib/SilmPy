Although magic in Middle-earth was not explicitly defined by Tolkien, it was a term used by the Hobbits to describe processes and abilities of objects which could not be explained outside of their limited lore and knowledge. For Elves and Wizards, what others might call magic was not something special or different from the natural world, just a part of it that was not immediately visible, leading to more common categorization of things as Seen or Unseen. The Seen aspects of a thing or person are only part of it. Through the power of the One Ring, Frodo Baggins at times saw powerful Elves, such as the High-elf Glorfindel, in their true level of power and radiance that extends into the Unseen.
==Magic by race==
===Ainur magic===
The Ainur as supernatural or angelic beings could shape the world in terms according to their natures. Melkor, later Morgoth, had great power but he could only mar or corrupt what his brethren had wrought.
In Morgoths Ring, it explains that, "to gain domination over Arda, Morgoth had let most of his being pass into the physical constituents of the Earth" which meant that everything that was born or lived on Earth, such as, beasts, plants, and incarnate spirits, were likely to be tainted. While with the One Ring, Saurons, "relatively smaller, power was concentrated; Morgoths vast power was disseminated. The whole of Middle-earth was Morgoths Ring." In this imbuement of Middle-earth, "Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his original angelic powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world."
Sauron, a lieutenant of Morgoth, was a powerful Maiar who used his powers to manipulate objects and his slaves. However, these acts of corruption, putting his will and power into other things and people lessened him as it did his master before him. "Evil is fissiparous. But itself barren." So with each creation or corruption, they themselves were lessened because parts of their power now existed outside of themselves. It was not an unlimited supply. Even the Ainur who resided in Aman had limits. For example, Yavanna could not remake the light of the Two Trees of Valinor. The only hope for them to be restored would be to reclaim the light captured of them in the Silmarils.
Some Maiar, like Sauron, had power nearly the equal of a Vala so that even Gandalf feared him. Whatever lore he shared with the Elves, such as the making of the Rings of Power in Eregion, would have unlocked their own understanding of how to craft the rings with their own innate abilities, which is how the master-smith Celebrimbor was able to create the Three Rings in secret. But the rings that Sauron had a hand in were corrupted and bound to his own power. Any power that Saurons slaves or servants had was sourced in him. Servants like the Black Númenóreans and the Men who became Nazgûl used this power as sorcery. For example, if Frodo Bagginss heart had been pierced with the Morgul-knife, he would have been a wraith and under the Ringwraiths command as they are under Saurons.

The Istari, the Maiar who came to Middle-earth in the diminished form of men, were tasked to help guide the Free peoples against Sauron. The nature of the Istari was not known to all, and they were known as wise old men. They were called Wizards. In Tolkiens mythology, this term is specifically only used for the Order of the Istari, who are of angelic origin. The word "wizard is a translation of Quenya istar (Sindarin ithron); one of the members of an order (as they called it), claiming to posses, and exhibiting, eminent knowledge of the history and nature of the World."
A member of the race of Men wielding magical powers would be referred to as a sorcerer, whether for good or evil. Although later contradicted, according to Tolkiens Letter 155, the concept of magic in his world did not come from lore or spells, and Men did not have magic. By this definition, lore like knowing the language of an animal, would not be considered magical in Middle-earth, merely knowledgeable.
===Elven magic===
Although the Eldar of Aman knew the powers of the Ainur and were even tutored by them, the Elves did not comprehend the concept of magic as it was used by mortals. Their bodies and spirits worked in harmony and creation came naturally to them. The Elvish "fëa was above all designed to make things in co-operation with the hröa." The Elves were taught arts and crafts by the Valar in Valinor and put dedication and love in every thing they wrought. They were deeply connected to the things they made, "the love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea." Due to their near immortality, Elves could reach high levels of mastery in crafts, arts, and lore.
The Rings of Power and lesser rings were objects that would seem magical to the Secondborn; they gave powers of manipulation to the bearer of the One Ring, and some might give the wearer invisibility, which was actually the ability to walk in the Unseen world. Other Elven artefacts were the Palantíri, the Fëanorian lamps, and the Mirror of Galadriel. Some simpler artefacts were the river-boats of the Galadhrim and the elven ropes, which seemed to have wills of their own. 
Galadriel was tutored by Melian when she resided in Doriath, and with her ring Nenya, she was able to enchant and protect the Lothlórien. Elrond wore the ring Vilya which helped him protect his hidden realm of Imladris. In the Third Age, Thranduil was the only Elf-lord who did not have a Great Ring to help him maintain his realm against the Enemy. However, he did have the Enchanted River, which made people fall asleep and dream deeply, and the Elvenkings Halls as his fortress to help protect his people.

Elves had skill with healing and medicine. Though it was natural to them, those who healed often chose not to fight, except at need, to preserve their skill, "for the Eldar deemed that the dealing of death  . . . diminished the power of healing." While ordinary for an Elf, it might have felt magical to someone healed by them who did not understand how they were using their fëa (spirit). Glorfindel helped heal Frodo, without seeming to do more than search the wound with his fingers, "Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier." There were no magic words or chants, and no medicine was applied at that time. He also gave Frodo and his companions a drink of clear liquid, which had no taste, that renewed their strength and vigour.
Elven minstrels, like Finrod and Lúthien, also had power in their songs. Finrod strove against Sauron in song and made great progress, but he was overpowered with a dire chant. Lúthien, who was half-maia, was able to use stronger enchantments to disguise herself and Beren, and she mesmerized Morgoth with her singing and dancing.
===Dark magic===
Sindarin has two words for dark magic: morgul and guldur. The element gûl literally means "magic lore" or "long study" and the negative connotations include "necromancy" and "sorcery". Môr translates to "dark" or "night" and dȗr means "dark" or "sombre". Sindarin translations found at: http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html Hiswelókës Sindarin dictionary Alone the words are perfectly neutral as the concept of magic itself is neutral in Middle-earth. However, when these terms are used in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings such as referring to Dol Guldur or a Morgul-knife, they have negative connotations. Morgul may be referred to as the dark lore and objects produced or influenced through the magic of Sauron and used for evil, which could be shared with his followers, such as the Nazgûl and Black Númenóreans.

The magic of Sauron, or other sorcerers who were taught how to use the corruption Morgoth left in Arda, was based directly upon the physical legacy of his previous master. The "Morgoth-element in matter . . . was a prerequisite for such magic and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it."
Sauron himself was also known as the Necromancer which indicated that he had power over spirits. The Witch-king, who wore a Ring of Power, had the ability to summon the Barrow-wights to the Barrow-downs.
===Dwarven magic===

The constructions of Dwarves had properties which might be seen as magical. An example could be the Doors of Durin which opened by themselves upon saying the word mellon, without visible machinery or other assistance. The magical appearance could be the technology of Dwarven ingenuity and craftsmanship. The Elven Door was created by the Dwarven craftsman Narvi and inscribed by the Elf-lord Celebrimbor with letters and signs fashioned in ithildin.
Another Dwarven door is seen in The Hobbit. The Back Door of the Lonely Mountain was a hidden, seamless door which had a keyhole that would only be revealed on Durins Day. The key lines that may infer an enchantment on the door are:

This appears to be what Tolkien might refer to as magia, or physical magic, because there is a crack and a flake of rock falls off the wall.
==Tolkiens views==
J.R.R. Tolkien discussed the operations and moral dimensions of magic in Letter 155 of The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien. This letter is actually an unsent part of a draft of Letter 154 which was dated September 25, 1954.
Magic in Middle-earth was explained as an innate ability set of the Ainur and the Firstborn, to the exclusion of other peoples. Regardless, The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings both contain descriptions of special items and weapons that are said to have been crafted by Men and Dwarves, such as the dagger wielded by Merry which stabbed the Witch-king and Angrist. 
The area of discussion in the letter is the difference between magia and goeteia, with magia (physical magic) usually noted as good and goeteia (charm and conjuring magic) as bad. He wrote, "neither is, in this tale, good or bad (per se), but only by motive or purpose or use. Both sides use both, but with different motives." The evil motive was to use it to dominate free will. The Enemy used his magia to "bulldoze" both people and things and used his goeteia to terrify and subjugate. The Elves and Gandalf sparingly used magia for specific beneficial purposes (like burning pine cones to toss at the Wargs), and their goetic effects were "entirely artistic and not intended to deceive: they never deceive Elves (but may deceive or bewilder unaware Men)." For Elves, the difference was as clear to them as the difference to us between art (fiction, painting, and sculpture) and life.
At the end of the draft noted as Letter 155, he wrote "a difference between the use of magic in this story The Lord of the Rings is that it is not to be come by by lore or spells; but it is an inherent power not possessed or attainable by Men as such." While "Aragorns healing might be regarded as magical, or at least a blend of magic and pharmacy and hypnotic processes . . . A. is not a pure Man, but at long remove one of the children of Lúthien." However, in The Fellowship of the Ring at the Doors of Durin, Gandalf said, "I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Orcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind."
The Númenórean Question: Since this 1954 letter draft was unsent, he seemed undecided on the total exclusion of Men from spellcasting. Since Men did not have the natural skill to weave their own spirit into things or ideas, they may have used spells. Alongside the final paragraph of Letter 155, which ended with the explanation that Aragorn was distantly of Lúthiens line, Tolkien wrote this question: "But the Númenóreans used "spells" in making swords?"
In a later work completed by 1959, the Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth, there is an amended note which contains the Tale of Adanel in which the strongest and the cruellest of the fallen Men who worshipped Morgoth, during the dawn of Men in Middle-earth, were given "gifts" and "knowledge that they kept secret" which made them "powerful and proud," and with their new power, they enslaved the other Men. In this later text, Men could be given artefacts or taught lore, but magic remained a noninherent trait. 
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the draft material that appears in The History of Middle-earth, the complex relationship of creation from the spirits and bodies of Ainur and Elves is explained as spells and enchantments. Irmo used poppies as reagents in his sleep enchantments. Aulë used spells in his smith-craft. Yavanna used spells and enchantments when creating and growing plants, and she gave spells to Ulmo to populate the seas with aquatic life during the age of "Melkos Chains". In "The Tale of Tinúviel", Lúthien, Melians daughter, wove with magics and spells in her tree house prison, and she was aided by her mother and her brother, Daeron.
