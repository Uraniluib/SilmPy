The Variags were a little-known people who dwelt in the land of Khand.
==History==
The Variags came from Khand, a little-known land southeast of Mordor. In the Third Age Khand was under the influence of Mordor; in  the Men of Khand together with the Haradrim of Near Harad joined the Wainriders to attack Gondor. 
During the War of the Ring the Variags fought at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. They were held in reserve in Osgiliath along with armies of Easterlings and Southrons. After the death of the Witch-king they were sent onto the battlefield by Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul). Their ranks were among troll-men and Orcs when the knights of Dol Amroth ran and drove them back.
==Etymology==
The meaning of Variag is unknown; it is, along with Oliphaunts and Khand, one of the few known words from the languages of the Men of the East and allies of Sauron., p. 79.
It is not clear if the word "Variag" is synonymous with the Men of Khand in general, or is a specific group or tribe of those men. The name appears only in context of the Battle of the Pelennor; the Appendix A mention the Men of Khand who moved against Gondor in the Third Age, but the name Variags is not used.
==Inspiration==
Wikipedia:Variag is a Slavic word derived from Norse Varingar "mercenary people" (vár "contract"). The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard Varangian Guard were Norse body-guards of the Byzantine Emperor.
It has been suggested that Tolkien adopted the Slavic term to indicate that the Variags were possibly mercenaries serving a possible Lord of Khand., Obscure Languages
