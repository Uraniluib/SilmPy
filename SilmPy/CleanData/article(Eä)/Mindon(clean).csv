==Quenya==
mindon is a noun meaning "lofty tower" in Quenya. Compare with minas in Sindarin.Ruth S. Noel, The Languages of Tolkiens Middle-earthhttp://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist edited by Helge Fauskanger
===Examples===
* Mindon Eldali√©va = "(Our) Tower of the Eldar"
==Sindarin/Noldorin==
mindon means "isolated hill ... especially a hill with a watch-tower" in Noldorin., pp. 373, 395 Evidently, this meaning was retained in Sindarin in the contraction min, as J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his Index questions that Min-Rimmon meant "peak of the Rimmon"., p. 511It is a bit unclear if Hammond and Scull interpret the meaning to be Sindarin, or if Tolkien so actually wrote in the unpublished manuscript.
===Etymology===
From Primitive Quendian minitunda or minitaun, derived from Sundocarme MINI + TUN.
===Examples===
*Min-Rimmon
