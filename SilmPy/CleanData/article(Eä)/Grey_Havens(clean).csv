The Grey Havens, also known as Mithlond, was a seaport on the Gulf of Lune at the mouth of the River Lhûn in western Eriador.
== History ==
Founded by the Elves of Lindon in , the Grey Havens were afterwards used by any of the Elves (whether Noldor, Sindar, or Silvan Elves) to leave Middle-earth for Valinor. Círdan was Lord of the Havens, but throughout the Second Age Gil-galad, High King of the Noldor, ruled all of Lindon from the Grey Havens.
In , Entulessë, a Númenóreans ship headed by Captain of the Kings Ships Vëantur, arrived in Mithlond. It was the first time the Númenóreans landed in Middle-earth., entry "600"
About  the Istari or Wizards arrived in Middle-earth at the Grey Havens. Círdan, upon meeting Gandalf, gave him Narya, the Elven Ring of Fire.
In , Prince Eärnur of Gondor brought a Gondorian fleet to the Grey Havens to aid Arthedain Angmar War Angmar. The fleet was so massive that the ships of Gondor filled the Grey Havens, as well as Forlond and Harlond.
In , Círdan sent Galdor of the Havens "on an errand" to Rivendell and he became Círdans representative at the Council of Elrond.
Following the defeat of Sauron and the crowning of King Aragorn in the War of the Ring, Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel left Middle-earth for Valinor from the Grey Havens. The Last Riding of the Keepers was accompanied by Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins, who were given the honor of taking the Straight Road because they had both been a Ring-bearers. Years later Fairbairn Family family tradition held that Samwise Gamgee in  also sailed Aman from the Grey Havens because he too had been a Ring-bearer, even if just briefly..
It is unclear how long the Grey Havens lasted into the Fourth Age, as the number of Elves dwindled with the coming of the "Age of Men". Supposedly Círdan remained at the Havens until the last ship left from Middle-earth for the Aman.
