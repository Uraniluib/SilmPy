Narchost was the western of the two Towers of the Teeth, that stood on two hills either side of the Black Gate of the Morannon, guarding the northwestern entrance into Mordor.  Narchost and its companion Carchost were originally built by the Gondorians, as a guard upon Mordor after Saurons first defeat.  As Gondors strength waned, Narchost was abandoned and left to decay, until Sauron returned to his ancient land.  His forces took over both the old guard-towers and repaired them, so that at the time of the War of the Ring, they formed part of Saurons own defences.
