Helmingas was a name for the Rohirrim of the Westfold, indicating the followers of and descendants of King Helm, just as the name Eorlingas referred to the people of Rohan who came after Eorl.  On 4 March  during the Battle of the Hornburg, when Orcs managed to penetrate the Deeping Wall, Gamling cried, "Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas! " to rally the men of the Westfold to repel the invaders.
