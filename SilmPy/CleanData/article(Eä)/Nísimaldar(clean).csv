Nísimaldar was the country around the haven of Eldalondë on Númenor western coast. It was the only place in Númenor where mallorn trees grew brought by Tol Eressëa, and it was from the stock of these that the Golden Wood of Lothlórien came. Many other trees grew in this land, all of them gifts from the Eldar.
==Etymology==
The name means Fragrant Trees, and it was so called because of the great variety of rare and beautiful trees that grew there.
