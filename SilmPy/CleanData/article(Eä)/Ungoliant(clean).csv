==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales, Ungoliants history is even more mysterious than what is implied in the published edition of The Silmarillion. Here, even the Valar did not know of her origins, and she was portrayed as a primeval spirit of night, and believed to be a creature bred of the darkness of the Void.
Also, Melkor and his companions encounter Ungoliant in her lair (here, known as Arvalin) by coincidence while fleeing from the Valar.
Melkor and Ungoliant are shown to be on much friendlier terms with each other than what is shown in later versions of The Silmarillion, as Melkor willingly offers the jewels that were stolen from the Elves, apart from the Silmarils (the Theft of the Silmarils occurring before the Darkening of Valinor, in this version).
She is wounded after the poisoning of the Golden Tree by a lone Elf named Daurin, whose sword is poisoned by her blood. While Ungoliant is recovering from her wound, Melkor kills Daurin and uses his sword to mortally wound the Silver Tree. After the Darkening of Valinor, instead of fleeing with Melkor, Ungoliant immediately flees southwards towards her lair, and successfully eludes the Valar.
In an early sketch of the voyages of Earendel in the Lost Tales, Tolkien considered to have Earendel meet her (as WirilomÃ«) in his travels, which Christopher Tolkien found surprising. In the first sketch of the Silmarillion (1926) intended to "reboot" the legendarium, Earendel slew Ungoliant.
In the Later Silmarillion, as documented in Morgoths Ring and War of the Jewels, Ungoliant is explicitly identified as one of Melkors servants who abandoned him prior to settling in Avathar. She is also depicted as starving to the brink of death during her time in Avathar, cut off from the light of the Valar by her own webs of darkness. She is also shown to fear her master, and hides desperately from Melkor when she first sees him approaching her lair. She initially refuses to emerge (believing Melkor plans to murder her for deserting him) until he offers her an assortment of gems he had stolen from the Noldor. She then regains the strength needed to destroy the Two Trees, which she does alone while Melkor waits near Avathar.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
