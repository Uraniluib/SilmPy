Nenya (Quenya, pron. ) was one of the Rings of Power; specifically, it was one of the Three Rings of the Elves of Middle-earth.  Also known as the Ring of Adamant and the Ring of Water, it was made of mithril and set with a white stone of adamant.
==History==
Nenya was made by Celebrimbor alone of Eregion between c.  and c. , along with the other two Elven Rings, Narya and Vilya.  After Celebrimbor discovered that Sauron had forged the One Ring in  he went to Lothlórien to seek the counsel of Galadriel.  They were unwilling to destroy the Rings so Galadriel advised Celebrimbor to keep them hidden, unused, and dispersed far from Eregion.  Celebrimbor followed this counsel, first by giving Nenya to Galadriel.  The power of this Ring strengthened and beautified the realm of Lothlórien, but it also increased Galadriels desire for the Belegaer and return to the Undying Lands.
The ring wielded by Galadriel was not normally visible.  On 14 February  Frodo Baggins saw Nenya on Galadriels finger, for it could not be hidden from the Ring-bearers.  Samwise Gamgee told Galadriel he only "saw a star through your fingers".This comment appeared in many editions of The Fellowship of the Ring as "finger"—which sounds more magical, since it suggests that her finger had somehow become transparent—but The Treason of Isengard, ch. 13, note 34, mentioned it as an error.
Nenyas power was preservation, protection, and concealment from evil.  After the destruction of the One Ring and the defeat of Sauron, its power faded along with the other Rings of Power. Galadriel bore Nenya on a ship from the Grey Havens into the Aman, accompanied by the other two Elven Rings and their bearers.  With Nenya gone, the magic and beauty of Lothlórien also faded and it was gradually depopulated, until by the time Arwen came there to die in  it was deserted and in ruin.
==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Quenya nén meaning water., Nen Nenya as an adjective means "watery" or "like water".
