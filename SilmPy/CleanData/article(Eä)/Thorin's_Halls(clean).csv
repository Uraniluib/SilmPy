For nearly forty years Thráin ruled his people in the Ered Luin but was driven to obsession by his Ring of Thrór. In  he left with a small group of followers to return to the Erebor determined to kill Smaug and take his fathers realm back.  But in  while encamped on the eves of Mirkwood Thráin was captured by the servants of the Necromancer and taken to Dol Guldur; where he was tortured till his death many years later.

Thorin ruled in the Ered Luin for nearly one hundred years, until he met Gandalf the Wizard who helped him concoct a plan to take back Erebor from Smaug; he left his halls for the last time on a Quest of Erebor.  After many months Thorin and Company took the mountain as theirs and Thorin declared himself King under the Mountain after Smaug was killed; but after a Battle of Five Armies with Orcs and Wargs Thorin was mortally wounded and died, never being able to enjoy the realm he gained.
===Dissolvement as the Capital===
After Thorins death, his cousin Dáin Ironfoot of the Iron Hills became king of Durins folk; and when news reached Dwarves of the Blue Mountains that Erebor was retaken, it is believed that most of them moved to the Lonely Mountain. Therefore, Thorins Halls became a sub-realm of Durins folk.
