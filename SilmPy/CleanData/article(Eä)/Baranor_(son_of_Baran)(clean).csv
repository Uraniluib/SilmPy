In the The Grey Annals, created in the 1930s,, p, 3 Bëor was followed by his sons Bregolas and Barahir.  After publication of The Lord of the Rings a new genealogy for the House of Bëor was made in the 1950s and at that time four generations (Baran, Boron, Boromir, and Bregor) were inserted after Bëor and before Bregolas and Barahir.  Baranor was also added as the brother of Boron.
