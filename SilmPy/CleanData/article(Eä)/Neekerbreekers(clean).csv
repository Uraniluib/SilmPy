__NOTOC__
Neekerbreekers were large and loud insects related to crickets. They dwelt in the Midgewater Marshes and squeaked all through the night, calling "neek-breek, breek-neek".  Samwise Gamgee gave them the name Neekerbreekers.
==Etymology==
Neekerbreekers were named so because of their sound, perhaps like that of a cricket., p. 760
