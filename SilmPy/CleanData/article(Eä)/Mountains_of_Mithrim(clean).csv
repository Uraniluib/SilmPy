The Mountains of Mithrim were a range of mountains located in Hithlum.  They formed the border between Mithrim and Dor-l√≥min, and thus between the realms of Fingolfin and his son Fingon after the Noldor settled in Hithlum. The caves of Androth, where some of the Elves of Mithrim dwelt after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, were probably in the Mountains of Mithrim.
