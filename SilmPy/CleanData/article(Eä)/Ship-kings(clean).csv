The Ship-kings was a title given to the great King Tarannon Falastur and his three successors: Eärnil I, Ciryandil and Hyarmendacil I. 
* Tarannon Falastur (-)
* Eärnil I (-)
* Ciryandil (-) 
* Hyarmendacil I (-)
The Ship-kings did much to expand Gondors naval and military might. Between them, they enormously extended the Gondors control over the southern lands of Middle-earth, including the lands west of the Ethir Anduin, and as far south as Umbar and the Harad. 
Their influence was such that, at the end of the reign of Hyarmendacil I, Gondor had reached a peak of strength and power that it would never again surpass.
