Morgul-wounds were inflicted by the weapons of Saurons greatest servants — or, at least, by those of the Nazgûl.  They carried dark enchantments that cursed the wounds suffered by their victims. The wounds themselves varied; those suffered by Steward Boromir (Steward of Gondor) in  left him in crippling pain and shortened his life (he died in ),  while the wound taken by Frodo Baggins on Weathertop on 6 October  threatened to make him a wraith.
On 13 March , when Faramir was retreating to Minas Tirith he held at bay a mounted soldier of Harad as the Nazgûl swirled overhead.  Faramir was struck down by a flying dart - it was feared that it was from the Nazgûl and had created a Morgul-wound.  However, after the great battle Aragorn examined the wound and found it to be healing.  This proved that Faramir had not suffered a Morgul-wound.  It had been believed that it was such though due to Faramirs sickness and fever, but Aragorn diagnosed Faramirs condition as due to weariness, grief, wounding, and the Black Breath.
