The Bow of Bregor belonged to Bregor, the Lord of Ladros, and remained a heirloom of the House of Bëor.
The House was decimated, but the Bow somehow survived into the Second Age and the Edain brought it to Númenor. It was kept as a heirloom of the Kings of Númenor, until its Downfall of Númenor, when it was lost during the deluge., Note 2
