The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series), "The Long Awaited Party" John Rye provided the voice of the Mouth of Sauron, symbolising the function of the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr. 
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
:The Mouth of Sauron does not appear in the theatrical cut of the movie, but he does appear in the extended version, played by an unrecognizable Bruce Spence. His helmet, with the words "LAMMEN GORTHAUR" (Sindarin for "Voice of (Sauron) The Abominable") in Cirth written on it, covers his entire face except for his mouth, which is horribly diseased and disfigured by all the evil he has spoken, and disproportionately large, creating an unsettling effect. In fact, much of this spectacle is a result of CGI effects. Actually Jackson conceived this idea long after the footage had been shot and asked his special effects team to create the effect digitally.
:The extended DVD cast commentary mentions that Jackson considered different depictions of the character, such as having Kate Winslet (who starred in Heavenly Creatures, another Jackson film) play the role, partially to emphasize the temptations Aragorn was facing.
:In the movie itself, Aragorn decapitates the Mouth of Sauron with Andúril.  This sequence is often criticized by purist and outsider alike; through human history it was considered a crime of war to execute messengers or heralds.  In the book, the Mouth actually specifically points out that as an ambassador he is protected by the laws of war, and Gandalf acknowledges this:
::"...though Aragorn did not stir nor move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow.  "I am a herald and an ambassador, and may not be assailed!" he cried.  "Where such laws hold," said Gandalf, "it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence.  But no one has threatened you.  You have naught to fear from us..." -- Book V, Chapter 10, "The Black Gate Opens"
