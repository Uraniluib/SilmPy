Shagrat was an Uruk-hai commanding the garrison of the Tower of Cirith Ungol during the War of the Ring.
==History==
During a patrol to Shelobs Lair, Shagrats company encountered a troop of Orcs from Minas Morgul led by Gorbag. The two did not get along, but before things escalated, they noted something out of place: a Frodo Baggins, all wound up in Shelobs webs. The discovery of what appeared to be an undersized Elves led the two commanders to compare their notes; they concluded that there must have been another nearby. But they could not find this "great Elf warrior". 
Turmoil rose again amongst the group when Gorbag and Shagrat disagreed with what they had to do with the prisoner. Shagrats orders from Sauron were simple; all personal effects were to be sent to Barad-dûr. Shagrat did not trust many of his own troops, and none of Gorbags, so he locked up the prisoner in the top chamber of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
Gorbag coveted the Mithril shirt Frodo wore, and attempted to usurp Shagrats rule. Though he was larger than his adversary, Gorbag lost to Shagrats superior numbers. Soon, Gorbags faction was pressed back. Shagrat eventually killed Gorbag, and ran off to Sauron with the prisoners belongings. He did not reach Barad-dûr until four days later; Sauron killed him after he delivered the news of intruders.Wayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page 609

==Portrayal in adaptations==
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Chris Fairbank played Shagrat.  He is overheard by Sam discussing Shelob with Gorbag, and then Sam encounters him again on the stairs in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
1989: Crack of Doom Software Adventure
:Shagrat is simply referred to in-game as a "large angry Orc". He is carrying a long red knife and a black bundle. He can be killed by Sam.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Peter Tait played Shagrat. In this adaptation, it is Shagrat and not Gorbag who covets the Mithril#The Mithril Coat shirt and starts the fight. In the The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition), he is shown escaping with the mithril shirt, which is then presented later by the Mouth of Sauron to the Captains of the West. It is unclear if this means Shagrat had changed his mind and brought the shirt to Barad-dûr, or if he was waylaid by Orcs loyal to Sauron during his escape, and the shirt was confiscated.
