 
Elemmírë was one of the lights kindled by Varda far in the past, to welcome the Elves to Arda on their awakening. It is described in Quenta Silmarillion as a star, but in fact it was most likely identified with one of the planets.
==Etymology==
Elemmírë means "star-jewel". Its a compound from elen and mírë. The letters n+m from both words are assimilated to long mm
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkiens notes on the subject are open to interpretation, but they appear to identify Elemmírë as the planet we know today as Mercury., p. 435
