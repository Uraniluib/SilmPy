Pelargir was a great city on the river Anduin, and the main harbour of Gondor.
==History==
Pelargir was built in  as a haven of the Faithful. The Kings Men established havens farther South. It had in its early days been a city only a few miles away from the coasts, but after the Downfall of Númenor the coasts along the Bay of Belfalas had retreated a great distance and the city was left far inland. Pelargir was one of the cities that assembled Gondor when it was founded in  by the Faithful.
It became an even greater haven in the days of the Ship-kings. Tarannon Falastur built a great house there, with its roots in the water which he so dearly loved. His wife, Berúthiel, did not, however, and preferred to live in Osgiliath with her Cats of Queen Berúthiel. Tarannons nephew Eärnil I, who succeeded him, rebuilt Pelargir and built a great navy to conquer Umbar.
Castamir was highly loved in the shore regions of the land, and when he usurped the throne, he purposed to move the throne from Osgiliath to Pelargir. Though he did not do so, he did move his base there. Eldacar (King of Gondor) turned the tide in the Kin-strife at the Battle of the Crossings of Erui in , and Castamirs family, supporters and ships retreated to Pelargir. Castamir Siege of Pelargir until they were driven out, making their way to Umbar. Castamirs great-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando eventually retook Pelargir in , and slew king Minardil.
Like his namesake, the great general Eärnil II took up residence in Pelargir. His Army of the South was stationed there during the Wainrider/Balchoth War. News of the Disaster of the Morannon reached him on 9 July , and he set out to Battle of the Camp. He returned victorious, and with the King and his sons slain, the general (of royal blood) was crowned King Eärnil II., "Cirion and Eorl"
During the War of the Ring, Pelargir was overrun by Corsairs of Umbar once again. Their fleet of some fifty great ships and many more smaller vessels laid in dock, ready to sail to Harlond (Gondor). It was not to be: Aragorn and the Oathbreakers struck fear into the men of Umbar, and they fled or dove into the river Anduin. After manning the Black Ships with Grey Company, Aragorn released the spell that had haunted the Dead Men since the day of Isildur.
==Etymology==
Pelargir is Sindarin for "Garth of (the) Royal Ships"., p. 535 (citing from the Unfinished index) Christopher Tolkien has noted that the first element derives from the Elvish element/root PEL ("go round, encircle"); the two other elements appear to be ar ("royal, noble") + cair ("ships").http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#P Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth at http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com (accessed 13 July 2011)

==Portrayal in adaptations==
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):

2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth:

2014: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Pelargir was built around the meeting of the rivers Sirith and Anduin, on the eastern border of the Lower Lebennin area and the Central Gondor region, west of Upper Lebennin and Eastern Gondor. Aragorns retaking of Pelargir was featured in an Epic Battle and served as the climax of Book 2 of The Strength of Sauron. The citys emblem was a blue anchor on a white background, with gold trim. The city was divided into the West-garth, the East-garth, the Market Ward, the Shipwrights Ward, the Court of the Ship-Kings, and Tol Ciryarani, though the latter was rendered inaccessible by a collapsed bridge by the time Aragorn liberated the city. Argillond, the Harbor of Royal Ships, was partitioned from the rest of the Great River by two sea-gates, one on the east and one on the west.
:Sirgon was Lord of the city during the War of the Ring, and was captured and spirited away by Haradrim slavers when the city was captured. Sirgons son Faltharan and his captain Thandor took command of the city following its liberation. Faltharan managed to rescue his mother and siblings, only to soon discover his brother Lorvegil had betrayed the city to the Corsairs of Umbar, allowing it to fall. After apprehending Lorvegil, Faltharan discovered and rescued their father at the Warning beacons of Gondor Sirthanc in Upper Lebennin.
