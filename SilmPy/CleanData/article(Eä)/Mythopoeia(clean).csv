Mythopoeia (Greek, "mythos-making") is the title of a poem by J.R.R. Tolkien, and the name of a term coined by him. 
"Mythopoeia" was created as reaction to C.S. Lewis statement that myths were "lies breathed through silver." The poem takes a position opposed to rationalism and materialism, referring to the creative human author as "the little maker" wielding his "own small golden sceptre" ruling his Sub-creation (understood as genuine Creation within Gods primary Creation).
While quoted in "On Fairy-Stories" (1947), and mentioned by Humphrey Carpenter in his J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography (1977), the poem was first published in its entirety in the 1988 edition of Tree and Leaf., pp. 620-2
==Fragment==
I will not treat your dusty path and flat, 
denoting this and that by this and that, 
your world immutable wherein no part 
the little maker has with makers art. 
I bow not yet before the Iron Crown, 
nor cast my own small golden sceptre down.
