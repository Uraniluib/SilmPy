__NOTOC__

Éothain was a rider of Rohan.
==History==
Éothain was a member of Éomers éored that overran the orcs who had captured Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took at the fringe of Fangorn Forest, and encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on 30 February, . Éothain scoffed at the idea that Hobbits even existed, believing them to be nothing but Holbytla, and argued against the gift of horses to Three Hunters.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the last drafts of The Riders of Rohan, Éothain was Éomers squire,, p. 401 whereas in a later draft of The Ride of the Rohirrim, he was the captain of Éomers household éored., p. 352 No reference to Éothains rank in Éomers éored is made in The Lord of the Rings.
==Etymology==
Éothain contains the Old English elements Éoh ("warhorse") and Thain ("warrior, chieftain"). It was a rendition of a Rohirric name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from lô/loh, "war-horse".
==Portrayal in adaptations==
