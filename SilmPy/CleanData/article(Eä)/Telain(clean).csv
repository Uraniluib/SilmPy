File:Soni Alcorn-Hender - Lórien Flets.jpg - Lórien FletsTelain (Sindarin, plural of Talan), known in Westron as flets, were platforms built in the trees by the Galadhrim Elves of Lothlórien.
==History==
Telain were built high up Mallorn trees, created in the space where the trunk of the tree divided into many branches; they lacked walls, or even rails, and were only accessible via a lowered hithlain rope-ladder. They were mainly used as guard-posts and watch-towers around the edges of Lothlórien. 
In Caras Galadhon, however, telain were more common and served more of a ceremonial function: it was on a house built on a talan that the Fellowship of the Ring met with Galadriel and Celeborn.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Telain were retained in the film, although there were no moveable plaited screens or rope-ladders visible. In The Lord of the Rings the meeting with Galadriel and Celeborn took place inside a large hall built on a talan, whereas in the film it took place on an open talan.
==Etymology==
Flet is an archaic English word referring to the floor of a house or a flat.
The Sindarin word talan or tâl ("flat space, platform"; pl. telain) is a descendant form of Common Eldarin talam-. The Quenya form is talma or talan, pl. talami., p. 52
