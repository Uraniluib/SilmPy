The Battle of Fornost was the climatic battle that defeated the Witch-king of Angmar and his armies.
== Prelude ==
In , the Witch-king of Angmar invaded the kingdom of Arnor. After centuries of conflict, in  messages were sent to King Eärnil II of Gondor that they were in great straits, and that Angmar was preparing its final assault.  The King sent his son Prince Eärnur, with a fleet of ships to Lindon to aid the northern Dunedain.  
But it was too late. Before the fleet would reach Lindon two years later, Arthedain (the last remnant of Arnor) had already been destroyed in the Fall of Fornost by the Witch-kings armies in . Its remaining forces fled west over the river Lune into the realm of Lindon, and its last king, Arvedui, perished in the Icebay of Forochel in 1975.
When Eärnur reached the Havens with his massive fleet, there was much joy and wonder among Elves and Men. Círdan, Lord of Lindon, summoned all who would fight from both his realm and the remnants of the Dúnedain of the North.  When all the preparations were finished this allied Host of the West (Arnor) marched east across the river Lune to challenge Witch-king in Fornost, which was populated with his minions, usurping the house and rule of the kings.
== The Battle ==
News of their march soon came to the Witch-king.  In his pride he sent his men out to meet them instead of waiting for battle within the fortress-like city, thinking he could drive them back over the Lune as before.
The Allies had passed over the southern Hills of Evendim and they met the forces of Angmar on the plains between Nenuial and Fornost.  A great battle ensued.  When Angmar forces began to retreat back to Fornost out of the north came the main body of the Allies horsemen, which had passed around the hills to come down and scatter the enemy in a rout.  The Witch-king, with all that he could rally, fled north to the lands of Angmar.  Before he could make it safely to his old fortress of Carn Dûm he was overtaken by the cavalry of Gondor with Prince Eärnur at its head.  Simultaneously a force led by Glorfindel came up out of Rivendell.  These two forces so utterly crushed the host of Angmar that not a single Man or Orc of that realm remained west of the Misty Mountains.
However, when all was lost the Witch-king appeared, singled out Eärnur, and rode upon him with a cry.  The Prince could have withstood him but his horse was so frightened that, while baring him, fled far away before he could master it.  As the Witch-king laughed at this, Glorfindel rode up on his white horse, and in mid laugh the Witch-king fled into the darkness of the night.  After hundreds of years the war was over.  Eärnur returned, and the Elf-lord said: "Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land.  Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall".
== Aftermath ==
The North was freed from the evil of realm of Angmar.  But since Arthedain had been destroyed those Dúnedain that remained became a nomadic people, the Rangers of the North. Aranarth son of King Arvedui became their Chieftain.
The Witch-king eventually made it to Mordor in , where he gathered the Nazgûl.  In  they besieged Minas Ithil and two years later took it.  In , the Witch-king sent a challenge to Eärnur who had become king that same year, but the challenge was ignored.  Years later in  a second challenge was sent, and this time Eärnur accepted.  He rode alone to Minas Ithil, now Minas Morgul, and was never seen again.  Following the loss of this last king the realm of Gondor was then ruled by the Stewards.
