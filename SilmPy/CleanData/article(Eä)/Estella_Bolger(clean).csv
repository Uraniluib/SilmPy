Estella Brandybuck, n√©e Bolger, was a Hobbits of the Shire. 
__NOTOC__
==History==
Estella was the second child of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. She was present at Bilbos Farewell Party. 
Her older brother, Fredegar Bolger, was well acquainted with Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Estella eventually married him after the War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
Jim Allan has suggested that Estella is related to the Spanish Estrella, derived from the Latin stella, both meaning "star".Jim Allan, An Introduction to Elvish, "Giving of Names", p. 197
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Tolkien added Estella to the family trees in Appendix C in the mid-1960s during the revisions that led to the second edition of The Lord of the Rings. For unclear reasons she did not initially appear in the hardcover edition, but only in the mass-market paperback edition published by Ballantine Books. Estella was finally added to the hardcover edition after an update to the text in 1987.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, "Note on the Text" (by Douglas A. Anderson)
