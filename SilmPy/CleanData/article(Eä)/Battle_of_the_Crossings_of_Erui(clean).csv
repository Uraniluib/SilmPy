The Battle of the Crossings of Erui was the last battle of the Kin-strife of Gondor.
==History==
In  the rightful King Eldacar (King of Gondor) returned to Gondor at the head of an army composed of Northmen and many of the folk from the northern fiefs of the realm.  Castamir gathered the peoples of the coasts, especially from Pelargir and Umbar, and met Eldacars forces at the Crossings of Erui, on the road between Pelargir and Minas Tirith.
The resulting clash was a victory for Eldacar, who slew Castamir in personal combat and regained the throne.  However, the sons of Castamir, his kin, and many people of the fleets escaped to Pelargir.  After enduring the Siege of Pelargir, in  these enemies of the king sailed to Umbar, for Eldacar had no ships to stop them.  Umbar became a refuge for the rebels for generations, until finally subdued by King Aragorn in the Fourth Age.
