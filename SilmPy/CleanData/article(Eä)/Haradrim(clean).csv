The Haradrim or the Southrons were the proud and warlike people of the Harad, in the south of Middle-earth. Ancient enemies of Gondor, they allied with Sauron during the War of the Ring.
== History ==
The ancestors of the Haradrim were Men who awoke in the First Age, but stayed to the East of Middle-earth, not joining the migration of the Edain to the West (disambiguation). They eventually settled in Harad, where the Sun is fierce and there are no clouds. It is possible that they were relatives of the Easterlings (First Age) who went to Beleriand after the Edain.
In the Second Age Sauron escaped the judgment of the Valar and continued his former masters work, turning the Men of the East and South (disambiguation) to evil and dominating them. Under the authority of the Dark Lord, many towns and walls of stone were built, and those under his influence became numerous and armed with iron. To these men, Sauron was feared as a king and god.
=== Second Age ===
During the Second Age the Númenóreans of Númenor built a great city in the firth of Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of Belfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from whose gates the Men of Númenor initially benefited the people in the lands they explored by teaching them many things about agriculture and craftsmanship. After the reign of Tar-Ciryatan, the Númenóreans began to set themselves up as lords in Middle-earth as they demanded tribute of goods and wealth, causing the oppression of the Haradrim. Under Ar-Pharazon, the Númenóreans made war on the Men of Middle-earth, enslaving them and using them for human sacrifices.
In the following centuries they were influenced by Sauron and Black Númenóreans, those evil High Men who stayed in Harad and survived the Downfall of Númenor. The Haradrim became enemies of Gondor, as the Kingdoms southern borders were close to their lands. Shortly before the War of the Last Alliance, two Númenórean lords, Herumor and Fuinur, "rose to great power amongst the Haradrim".
=== Third Age ===
The Haradrim did not trouble the Realms in Exile for many centuries. There were dealings between the southlands and Gondor in these days, though it is said that there was never friendship between the two realms. When Gondor took the haven of Umbar from the Black Númenóreans, in the year  they followed the Black Númenóreans against Umbar to recapture it. Their great power was not enough against the sea-power of Gondor. The attempts lasted for 35 years until, in , Ciryaher defeated the Haradrim force by sending troops by land. They acknowledged the overlordship of Gondor; the kings of Harad did homage and their sons were given as hostages in the court of the Kings of Gondor.
Later however kings of Harad who were in league with the Umbar rebelled against Gondor. King Aldamir fell in battle against them but his son Vinyarion won a great victory in Harad in .
The Haradrim later were allied with the Wainriders, a confederation of Easterlings, and the Men of Khand. During the simultaneous assaults from the north and the south, the South-kingdom came close to destruction. The campaigns ended with the Wainraiders definite defeat in the Battle of the Camp in .
Around that time, some Haradrim were among the Corsairs of Umbar, a constant harassment for Gondor., entry "Haradrim"
The Haradrim were stirred up by emissaries of Sauron to attack Gondor again, and in , they did so at the Crossings of Poros, but were defeated again as they faced also the Rohirrim. The twins sons of Kings of Rohan Folcwine of Rohan, were slain in that battle.
At the time of the War of the Ring, the Southrons were in league with Sauron and fought alongside his Orcs army. The Haradrim were among the forces led by the Witch-king that attacked Osgiliath on 20 June, , at the beginning of the War. They captured the eastern half of Osgiliath, but Boromir and Faramir cast down the bridge across the Anduin and defended the western half of the city. More Haradrim continued to come up the Harad Road to Mordor. Faramir and the Rangers of Ithilien ambushed some companies of Haradrim, but they could not stop them all.
In the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, they deployed cavalry and gigantic, Elephants-like Oliphaunts. Regiments of Haradrim joined the host from Minas Morgul marching to the Pelennor Fields. Saurons forces besieged Minas Tirith, and the Mûmakil of Harad were used to bring forward war-towers and siege-engines to test the Citys defences. One of the leaders of the Haradrim at this time bore the standard of the Black Serpent and was slain by King Théoden of Rohan at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on 15 March .
Once Sauron was destroyed, Southrons in the western lands of Harad submitted to the rule of King Aragorn and were conquered. The Southrons in the East, however, remained independent.
== Traits and culture ==

The Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall and dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were called Swertings or Swarthy Men. The men of Near Harad were brown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as "Half-trolls" out of Far Harad had black skin.
Many Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet robes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars, earrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair with gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also the color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their shields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that at the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of iron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore scimitars that glittered like stars.
The Haradrim had tamed the massive Oliphaunts beasts and used them in warfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold. They even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and spearmen.
Harads tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there were many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the peoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.
===Language===
To the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.
The only word which is stated to come from a southron language is "Mûmak", the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.
Gandalf states that his name in "the south" is "Incánus" thought Inkā-nūsh (or possibly Inkā-nūs), meaning "North-spy".
Despite having a meaning in Quenya ("fate"), the name Umbar is said to be adapted from the natives language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.
== Etymology ==
Haradrim is a Sindarin name, consisting of the elements harad ("south") + rim ("host"), p. 178 thus meaning "South-people".

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Early variant names for this people were the Barangils, the Haradwaith (from the name of their land) and Haradrians., pp. 16-7
Early Westron names include Harwan and Silharrows, which are derived from the Old English name of the Aethiopians, Sigelhearwan (See also: Sigelwara Land)., Note 4
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:The Haradrim appear briefly in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers when Frodo and Samwise Gamgee witness a raid on one of their columns by Faramir rangers. They are featured more prominently in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, in which the battle between the Rohirrim and the Oliphaunts is a major action sequence.
:While the The Return of the King depicts the Southron army as primarily cavalry armed with scimitars, we see no horsemen in the movie: the Haradrim fight almost exclusively from platforms mounted on the backs of their monstrous oliphaunts. They have also adorned the animals tusks with spikes and shafts that crush and impale numerous enemy horsemen.
:The costumes of the Haradrim in the movie are Middle Eastern in style and dark brown or black in colour, while the Haradrim wore red livery in the book.
