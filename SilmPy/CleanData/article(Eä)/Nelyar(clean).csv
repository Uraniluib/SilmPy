The Nelyar (Quenya, pron ) was the original name of the third Clan of the elves, Teleri, before the Great March. The Clan-name, meaning Thirds (q. cardinal nelya third) was derived from the name of the father of the Clan, Enel Three. Enel was the third Elf-fathers, who awoke at Cuiviénen. 
They were the largest clan, being the 74/144 of the population. Of those, the 46/74 followed Elwë to the West and became the Teleri, while 28/74 Avari with Morwë and/or Nurwë.
The other original clans were Minyar Firsts, and Tatyar Seconds according to the Elf-fathers Imin One and Tata Two.
Eventually some of the Avari of the Nelyar reached Beleriand. Unlike the Tatyar, those Avari were friendly to the Eldar, willing to learn from them and had a feeling of kinship. Later in Eriador and the Vales of Anduin, Lindarin Avari often merged with the Eldar of Middle-earth., p. 380-1
