Henneth Annûn was a hidden Gondor outpost north-east of Cair Andros in North Ithilien. During the War of the Ring, Faramir son of Steward Denethor had his base of operations there, and Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were taken there by his company.
This secret dwelling consisted of a cave behind a west-facing waterfall, the Window-curtain, overlooking an oval pool. The cave had been excavated by the stream feeding the waterfall, which originally fell from the hole in the cliff constituting the window in the name, but that stream had since been diverted and the tunnel sealed, save for a concealed entrance.
==History==
In the days of Ruling Steward Túrin II most of the remaining people of Ithilien departed due to the influx of Mordor-orcs. In response, in  he had Henneth Annûn constructed as a secret refuge for the Rangers of Ithilien. Other outposts were also established but Henneth Annûn was the longest guarded and manned.
On 1 March  Faramir left Minas Tirith to go to Henneth Annûn to prepare a raid against enemy soldiers marching north through Ithilien. When the raid occurred on 7 March Faramir also met Frodo and Sam, and afterwards brought them to the hidden cave.

Frodo and Sam were led blindfolded into the cave and had their eyes uncovered just as sunset shown through the curtain of water. Faramir fed and spoke with the two travellers, gradually gaining their trust until Sam accidentally revealed Frodos possession of the One Ring. Faramir though resisted any temptation to seize it for himself. Later in the night Gollum came to the forbidden pool beneath the cave. In order to save his life Frodo had to draw in the creature until Faramirs men could capture him. Frodo convinced Faramir to spare Gollum even though Faramir had his doubts.
On the morning of 8 March Frodo, Sam, and Gollum were allowed to depart from Henneth Annûn to continue their journey into Mordor. The next day Faramir and his men vacated the refuge; three followed their captain to Minas Tirith while the remainder of the company rode to Osgiliath. The refuge remained abandoned during the rest of the War of the Ring.
