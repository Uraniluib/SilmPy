To celebrate each gathering of fruits, Manwë made a high feast in praise of Ilúvatar. For this feast, the Valar and Maiar were bidden to come to the Ilmarin. Just before the Darkening of Valinor, a feast was held to which also the Vanyar and Noldor came, and they sang together with the Maiar before Manwë and Varda.
