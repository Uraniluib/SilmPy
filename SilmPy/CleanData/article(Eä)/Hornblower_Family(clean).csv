The Hornblower Family was an old and important family of the Shires Southfarthing. Its most famous member was Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom, who introduced pipe-weed into the Shire, and his family remained associated with the industry. Their Longbottom Leaf variety was famous, and indeed barrels of Leaf bearing the Hornblower mark were found as far afield as the ruins of Isengard. It should be noted that the hobbits considered their habit of smoking an art, and that Perigrin Took and Meridoc Brandybuck were very excited when they found the stash at Isengard.
From Tobolds time, and perhaps earlier, the Hornblowers were one of the Shires more important families. The importance of the family is also seen in the jewel-name of Amethyst Hornblower, and her marriage into the Bolger Family. Frodo Baggins himself had Hornblower blood â€” his great-grandfather Largo Baggins married one Tanta Hornblower. 
==Etymology==
The meaning of this old family name is occupational; perhaps one of Tobolds ancestors, or himself, actually did blow a horn of some kind., p. 760 Perhaps the name is a punning reference to pipe-smoking.
