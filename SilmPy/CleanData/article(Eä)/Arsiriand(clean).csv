Arsiriand is one of the rejected names of Beleriand which J.R.R. Tolkien jotted down "on a page of rough working for the opening of the The Lay of Leithian" (of Leithian) when he was probably searching for a replacement of Broseliand, used so far.
All in all there were eight of these names: Golodhinand, Nold√≥rinan, Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, and Ossiriand.
