ered is the plural form used by J.R.R. Tolkien in his writings of the 1930s and 1940s (including The Lord of the Rings) and by Christopher Tolkien in the published The Silmarillion. In his later work on the Silmarillion in the 1950s and 60s, J.R.R. Tolkien often used the plural form eryd instead, for example Eryd Lindon, p. 385 and Eryd Gorgoroth, p. 297 replacing earlier Ered Lindon and Ered Gorgoroth.
In the normal pluralization rules of Sindarin, the form eryd would be the proper plural, because an o in the final syllable of a singular noun became y in the plural, such as emyn the plural of amon "hill" and gelydh the plural of golodh "Noldo". To explain the presence of ered in The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien considered modifying the internal history of the Sindarin pluralization, so that the y-plurals of the First Age had changed to e by the Third Age, except in limited cases such as before nasals like n and m (to explain emyn, which also appeared in The Lord of the Rings)., p. 33 Tolkien even noted: "Use Eryd in Silmarillion" (Parma Eldalamberon 17, p. 33). Perhaps Christopher used Ered in The Silmarillion to be consistent with The Lord of the Rings.
