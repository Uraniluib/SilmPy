The Fat was an epithet applied to a few character in J.R.R. Tolkiens works whose defining characteristic was their girth. Perhaps the best known, and indeed the only one mentioned by name in The Lord of the Rings, was Forlong the Fat, the Lord of Lossarnach who met his fate in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  In The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, though, Tolkien introduced us to a character who shared Forlongs title - Lalia Clayhanger, the widow of Thain Fortinbras Took II of the Shire.
