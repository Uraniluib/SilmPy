2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Having arrived at Rivendell with Thorin and Company, Gandalf met with Elrond, Galadriel, and Saruman. It seems that Gandalf was unaware that the meeting would take place. Whilst this meeting is not explicitly called the "White Council," its membership and discussion points have much in common with the White Council in J.R.R. Tolkiens writings. Much of the history of the Third Age is conflated and substantially altered. Gandalf told the Council that Radagast had found Dol Guldur occupied by a Sauron#Saurons Return. Saruman was very sceptical of Radagasts story and dismissed Gandalf for believing him. Gandalf and Galadriel converse telepathically before the wizard showed the Council a Morgul-knife which belonged to the Witch-king; the blade and Nazgûl had been buried together many centuries previously following the downfall of Angmar.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:Gandalf has been imprisoned by Sauron after a failed solo mission to the stronghold. Galadriel arrives at the fortress to rescue him, vanquishing an Orcs in the process. She and Gandalf are then surrounded by the spectres of the Nazgûl, but Elrond and Saruman arrive on the scene and attack them. Galadriel heals Gandalf, and he is swiftly taken to safety by Radagast. Sauron himself manifests before the council, but Galadriel assumes a dark ethereal form and overpowers him, with Saurons spirit fleeing into Mordor.
