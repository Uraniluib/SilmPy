Nindalf, or Wetwang in Westron, was a swampy land of pathless fen beneath the Emyn Muil.
As the great inland delta of the Entwash fed Anduin from the west, and Anduin divided into many channels, marshlands were formed to the east of the Great River, south of the Emyn Muil. The Dead Marshes lay further east and may have been an extension of Wetwang.
On 16 February  Celeborn warned the Fellowship of the Ring against becoming lost in the region, recommending instead that those heading to Minas Tirith leave the river above the Falls of Rauros.
