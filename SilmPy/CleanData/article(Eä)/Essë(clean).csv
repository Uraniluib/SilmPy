essë (pl. essi) is a noun meaning "name" in Quenya., Note, The names of the letters Compare with eneth in Sindarin.
==Elvish Naming==
According to the naming traditions of High Elves, an Elf can have four types of names, acquired at various times of their lives. The three first names are called the anessi ("given-names"): the father-nameThere is no attested Quenya term for this name, but we can conjecture it is ataressë, the amilessë ("mother-name"), and the epessë ("after-name" or honorary title). The last type of name is called the kilmessë: the chosen-name ("self-name").
====Anessi====
* Father-name: chosen by the father and often based on the fathers own name or derived from old legends. Given at or near birth.
* Amilessë: chosen by the mother and often prophetic in nature. Given sometimes at or near birth but often bestowed years later.
* Epessë: often acquired by an Elf as an honorific later in life.
====Kilmessë====
* Kilmessë: a name chosen by an Elf for him- or herself as a disguise or to refer to deeds, talents and personal history.
The father-name and the amilessë were the Elfs true names and were public names. The father-name is the name an Elf used in public until an epessë was chosen., Note on Mother-names, p. 339 In The Silmarillion, when an Elf does not yet have an epessë, the Sindarin version of his mother- or father-name is used instead.
===Examples===
* Maglor: The son of Fëanor of the House of Finwë, was given the essi Kanafinwë ("Strong-voiced of Finwë"). His amilessë was Makalaurë ("Forging Gold" in a poetic sense)., The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod, p. 353 The name Maglor is the Sindarin version of his mother-name.
* Gil-galad: The son of Orodreth was given the essi Gil-galad., The parentage of Gil-galad, p. 350 His amilessë was Gil-galad ("Star of Radiance"). As High King of the Noldor, his epessë was Gil-galad ("Scion of Kings")., The names of Finwës descendants, p. 347
* Finrod: The son of Finarfin was given the essi of Finrod ("Golden-haired Champion"). His amilessë was Ingoldo ("The Noldo", singular for Noldor)., The names of Finwës descendants, p. 346 He is usually referred to as Felagund ("Hewer of Caves"),, The Dwarvish origin of the name Felagund, p. 351 originally a derogatory nickname given to him because of his dwelling at Nargothrond. Finrod adopted the name as his epessë and made it a title of honour. The name Finrod is the Sindarin version of his father-name.
* Galadriel: The only daughter of Finarfin was given the essi of Artanis ("Noble Woman") and the amilessë of Nerwen ("Man-maiden") because of her height and strength. Her epessë, Alatáriel ("Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland"), was given to her by her husband, Celeborn. The name Galadriel is the Sindarin version of her epessë.
* Amras: The last son of the House of Finwë was given the essi Telufinwë, ("Last of Finwë"). His first amilessë was Ambarussa ("Top-russet" referring to his hair), his twin-brother Amrod hat the same amilessë. To distinguish the two Amrod was given a second amilessë: Umbarto ("The Fated"). His mothers choice was prophetic, because Amrod was the first of the sons of Fëanor to die, accidentally killed in the swan ships of the Teleri when his father ordered them to be burnt at Losgar. The name Amras is the Sindarin version of Ambarussa.
==Tengwa==
Image:Essë.gifEssë is also the name in later Quenya of the thirty-first letter of the Tengwar alphabet, representing SS.  The original name of this letter was Áze, but over time the phonemes for "z" and "r" merged and the letter was renamed Áre.  Since Óre (letter 21) represents untrilled "r" and Rómen (letter 25) represents trilled "r", Áre became superfluous.  This letter was then renamed Essë and represents "ss", but only in written Quenya.
