__NOTOC__
NASAG is an Elvish Sundocarme of unknown primary signification, although its derivatives relate to "compulsion, bond"., pp. 17, 101 (footnote 155)
==Derivatives==
*Common Eldarin: nasag > nazg- ("compulsion, bond"); nazgwē ("bondage, durance")
**Quenya: naxa ("bond, fetter"); nasque ("bondage, durance")
**Sindarin: nadha ("fetter")
**Black Speech: nazg
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Before undertaking a revision in the late 1960s, J.R.R. Tolkien had written (probably in 1951) that root NASAG yielded the derivative nazgwē, historically shifted to nasque ("evil Spectres").
