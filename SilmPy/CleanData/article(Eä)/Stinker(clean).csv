For Sméagol, the creature also known as Gollum, the loss of the The One Ring and his tortures in the land of Mordor had destroyed his mind. By the time he met Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee beneath the Emyn Muil, his personality had split into two, with one side seeking companionship and favour, and the other side desperately wanting to recover the Ring at any cost, including the murder of his companions. Sam secretly gave names to these two sides of Sméagol: the pathetic, simpering side he called Slinker, but the jealous, dangerous side he gave an even worse name: Stinker. As Gollums darker side took him over completely, so Sam started to use the name Stinker as just another name for the scheming creature.
