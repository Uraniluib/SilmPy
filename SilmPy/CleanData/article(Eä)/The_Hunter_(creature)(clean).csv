The Hunter was a shadowy creature of Elves legend, said to have plagued the newly-awakened Elves at Cuiviénen.
The true identity of the Hunter is unknown. The legend could have had its source in lies spread by Morgoth about Oromë, in an attempt to deceive the Elves into thinking that he was evil. It is also possible that the Hunter was one of the "shadows and Spirits (creatures)" sent by Melkor to spy upon and harass the Quendi, or even Melkor himself.
