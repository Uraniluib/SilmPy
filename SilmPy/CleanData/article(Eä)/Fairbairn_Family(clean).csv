__NOTOC__
The Fairbairn Family was the family name of the descendants of Samwise Gamgee, through his eldest daughter Elanor Gardner and her husband Fastred of Greenholm, because her elvish beauty was long inherited by her descendants., p. 757
Fastred became the first Warden of Westmarch, a title handed down to his son Elfstan Fairbairn and his descendants. The family seat was at Undertowers on the Tower Hills, so that the family are often referred to as the Fairbairns of the Towers.
The Fairbairns were also the heirs of the Red Book of Westmarch to which they made additions and also created copies.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, p. 134
