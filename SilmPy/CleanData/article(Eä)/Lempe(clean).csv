lempe is the Quenya word for the number five., pp. 24-5, p. 24, p. 368, p. 95
In a late manuscript, J.R.R. Tolkien also suggested the Quenya form lemen ("five"), which had been rejected in other manuscripts., pp. 6, 20 (note 17)
Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the form lempÃ« (retaining the same meaning) would be valid Neo-Elvish.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 25 June 2011)
