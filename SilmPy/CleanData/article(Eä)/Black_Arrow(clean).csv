 
According to Bard, the Black Arrow had originated in the Lonely Mountain and had been passed down to him from his father and grandfather of the line of Girion. It was magical for him and whenever he shot it, he always recovered it.
When in  the Dragons Smaug attacked Lake-town, after being disturbed by Thorin and Company in the Lonely Mountain, the Black Arrow was the last arrow left in Bards quiver.
Bard fired the arrow through a bare patch in the armour on Smaugs underbelly, described to him by the Thrushes. The arrow penetrated Smaugs heart, killing the dragon immediately.
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien may have found inspiration for the weapon that achieves its goal and then perishes in Beowulf (poem).  In that story Beowulfs sword cannot kill Grendals mother but another sword, an ancient blade found in her lair, can destroy her and slice off Grendels head.  However, the sword then melted down to the hilt., (ii) The Black Arrow, p. 558
