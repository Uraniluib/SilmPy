Dwimorberg or Haunted Mountain was one of the White Mountains. To the west, there was the ancient hold of Dunharrow overlooking Harrowdale from the east.
The mountain was brooding and black. On its lower slopes was the wood of Dimholt. Beyond its glen and behind a single standing stone, was the Dark Door, which led inside the Dwimorberg and the haunted Paths of the Dead. 
The wraiths of the Oathbreakers haunted the mountain, giving it its name. After Aragorn redeemed them, the Dwimorberg was haunted no longer. 
==Etymology==
The name means "haunted mountain" in Old English, representing the Rohan language,, p. 101 from Wiktionary:dwimor#Old_English "phantom, ghost" + Wiktionary:beorg#Old_English "mountain". 
The first element, from which the English word dwimmer derives, is also seen in the Rohanese names Dwimordene (Lothl√≥rien) and Dwimmerlaik (Witch-king).
