Club-foot was the nickname given to Brandir by Túrin during an argument. 
After Túrin had slain the Dragons Glaurung, Túrin returned to Nen Girith to see Níniel and bring tidings to House of Haleth of Ephel Brandir that the threat of the dragon had passed. Brandir told Túrin that Níniel was dead and that she was, in fact, Túrins sister Nienor; in the following argument Túrin called Brandir Club-foot before cursing him and eventually killing him.
