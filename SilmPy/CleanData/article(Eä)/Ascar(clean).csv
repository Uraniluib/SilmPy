Ascar was the northernmost of the rivers that flowed through Ossiriand. It emerged near Dolmed and, the Dwarf-road of Beleriand from the Blue Mountains lay along its northern bank, until it met Gelion at Sarn Athrad. 
==History==
After the murder of King Thingol of Doriath the Dwarves of Nogrod easily entered Menegroth where they Battle of the Thousand Caves and plundered the halls, retaking the Nauglamír. The victorious Dwarves marched along the banks of the Ascar with their spoils.  Suddenly, Beren, Dior his son, and a host of Green-elves attacked the Dwarves.  After the Battle of Sarn Athrad Beren reclaimed the Nauglamír, but had the rest of the treasure of Doriath cast into the Ascar.  From that time forth the river was renamed Rathlóriel ("Goldenbed").
==Etymology==
Asgar in Noldorin means "rushing" or "impetuous",, Ascar derived from Sundocarme A-SKAR.
In Eriols Old English translations, Ascar is referred to as Baening. Christopher Tolkien tentatively interpreted the O.E. name as "river filled with bones (of the Dwarves)", but doubted that it was his fathers intended meaning.
The name Rathlóriel means "Golden-bed". In the The Etymologies, the name Rath Loriel is said to contain the Noldorin word Rath#Noldorin ("coarse, river-bed") and glaur ("gold")., pp. 368, 383, p. 11
