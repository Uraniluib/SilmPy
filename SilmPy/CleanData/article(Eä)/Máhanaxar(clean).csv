Máhanaxar, also called Rithil-Anamo p. 401, was the Ring of Doom, probably a hall or court where the Valar held their councils.
The Ring was outside the golden western gates of the city of Valmar, not far from the hill Ezellohar, with the thrones of the Valar arranged in circle.
The Valar were sitting on their thrones while watching Yavanna chanting, bringing the Two Trees to life upon Ezellohar. Ever after, the Powers sat bathed in the light of the Trees to hold their great councils, and here some of the most momentous decisions of Eäs history were made.
==Etymology==
The name is how the Amanyar called the Ring of Doom in Quenya. It contains the word Máhan "chief Vala". p. 402.
All in all, it is said to be derived from Valarin Mâchananaškad., p. 399
