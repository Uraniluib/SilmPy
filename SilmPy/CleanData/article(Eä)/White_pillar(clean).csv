The White Pillar was a monument erected upon the highest hill of the headland overlooking Umbar. The great pillar was white with a crystal globe set on top. The globe absorbed the rays of the Sun or the Moon and shone like a star that could, in clear weather, be seen far out to sea or even upon the south coasts of Gondor.
==History==
In  the Númenórean King Ar-Pharazôn landed at Umbar and humbled the might of Sauron. Although Ar-Pharazôns reign represented the darkest times of Númenor, culminating in disaster, Elendil and his exiled followers remembered the landing with pride; they erected the White Pillar in memory of the event, commemorating the power of their race, and the humiliation of the Dark Lord.
At the end of the Kin-strife between the factions of Eldacar (King of Gondor) and Castamir, the sons of the usurper sailed with their followers from Pelargir to Umbar in , removing the city from Gondors control. After Umbar fell under the domination of Saurons servants the memorial of his humiliation was destroyed.
