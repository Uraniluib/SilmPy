 
Enerdhil was a legendary, and quite possibly mythical, Noldor smith of Gondolin. According to one account, it was Enerdhil who made the original Elessar of Eärendil, an astonishing green gem through which marred and broken things could be seen as though whole and healed again. This Elessar was given as a gift to Idril, and given by her to her son Eärendil, who bore it on his voyages across the Belegaer.
==Etymology==
David Salo suggests that the name is a loan from Quenya Anardil meaning "sun-friend". 
The Sindarin form of the name displays what he calls "hyper-Sindarization", with i-affection before the ending -ndil whereas it shouldnt occur in "proper" Sindarin., p.87
==Other versions of the legendarium==
More recent accounts name Celebrimbor as the maker of the two Elessars, both Eärendils and Aragorns.
The fact that there are two possible Elessars makes Enerdhil fit into the mythos, as the first one could have been made by him and Elfstone by Celebrimbor. But not even this has been resolved clearly.
