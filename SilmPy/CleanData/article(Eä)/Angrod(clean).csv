== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
From the earliest writings (for example, the Lay of Leithian) till after the publication of the first edition of The Lord of the Rings Orodreth is given as Angrod and Felagunds brother instead. This was retained in the published The Silmarillion, although the changes of their fathers name from Finrod to Finarfin and of (Inglor) Felagunds name to Finrod were adopted there. Also, in the published The Silmarillion Gil-galad is the son of Fingon, this was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien which he admitted was a mistake.
