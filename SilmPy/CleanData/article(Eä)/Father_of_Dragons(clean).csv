Father of Dragons was a title given to Glaurung, the first of the Dragons. Whether Glaurung was literally the father of all dragons, as for example Durin was father of all his folk, is unknown; the origins of dragon-kind remain mysterious. On balance, however, this seems unlikely due to the differences between individual dragons - for example, Glaurung was wingless, whereas many of the later dragons had wings.
