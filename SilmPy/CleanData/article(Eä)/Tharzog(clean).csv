Tharzog is a character in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North and the first boss of that game. He was the chieftain of the Orcs of Mount Gram.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Chapter 1: Fornost, Citadel Tower
==History==
When Tharzog heard that Agandaûr assembled an army in Fornost, he travelled to Fornost and fought a way to the citadel.  Here he offered his services to Agandaûr, who accepted it after recognizing Tharzogs strength and loyalty to Sauron. Tharzog became Agandaûrs lieutenant. When Eradan (video game character), Andriel, Farin (video game character), Elladan and Elrohir infiltrated Fornost, Tharzog was the one who told Agandaûr that there were intruders and that Beleram - a captured Eagles - was freed. He noticed the intruders trying to sneaking into the Citadel tower, after which he ordered to close the gate to the top of the tower. This seperated Eradan, Andriel and Farin from Elladan and Elrohir. The latter confronted Agandaûr, while he and his guard fought the earlier. He was killed by them, and his guard was slaughtered.
==Personality==
Unlike many other Orcs and Goblins, Tharzog was truely loyal to Sauron and Agandaûr. He would sacrifice his whole guard to protect Agandaûr and ensure that Saurons plans would be succesful. He was both very strong and quick, and was therefore most feared - with the sole exception of Agandaûr - of all creatures in Fornost.
