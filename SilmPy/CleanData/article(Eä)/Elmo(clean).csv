Elmo was an Elf of the Nelyar born at Cuiviénen. He was the brother of Thingol and Olwë. He remained behind when Elwë was lost, becoming one of the Sindar of Doriath.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Elmo was developed to explain the reference in The Silmarillion that Celeborn was a "kinsman of Thingol". One of the solutions was to establish Celeborn as the son of an unimportant brother of Thingol.
In other, later writings, Celeborn is made into a Telerin Elf, and a relative of Olwë of Valinor instead, but this was not further developed or published.
