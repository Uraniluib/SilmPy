Coffee was a beverage known at least by the Hobbits and the Dwarves in the Third Age. When Bilbo Baggins entertained Thorin and Company and Gandalf in Bag End in April , he had to set a big jug of coffee in the hearth, because one of the five dwarves who entered together (Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, and Gloin) asked for it.
Coffee is not mentioned elsewhere in The Hobbit, and it is not mentioned at all in The Lord of the Rings.
