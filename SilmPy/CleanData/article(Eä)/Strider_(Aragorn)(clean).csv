Strider, or Stick-at-naught Strider, was a nickname given to Aragorn by the people of Eriador (as for example at Bree) during his time as a Rangers of the North. 
The name seems to refer to the long legs of the Rangers, who were of Númenóreans blood, compared to the shorter-legged Bree-landers. 
Though Aragorn considered the name scornful, he took it as the name of his royal house: translated into Quenya as Telcontar.
Leaving Minas Tirith, Frodo Baggins jokingly named his pony "Strider (pony)" in order to honor his former companion.
