__NOTOC__
Luvailin or Shadowmere was a mere in Eldamar under the shadow of Oiolossë., p. 217 
Shadowmere is mentioned  in Bilbo Baggins  Song of Eärendil in Rivendell:
...where pale as glass
beneath the Hill of Ilmarin
a-glimmer in a valley sheer
the lamplit towers of Tirion
are mirrored on the Shadowmere.
As the mere reflected the lights of the city of Tirion, "it must have lain in or near to" the valley of Calacirya.
==Etymology==
Luvailin appears only in the Unfinished index. The name Shadowmere is said to be its "translation". Though Tolkien did not provide an explanation of the latter, Tolkien fandom have speculated that Luvailin seems to contain the elements luv- *"shadow-" (seemingly from √LUM, LUB "shadow, darkness",, pp. 161, 168) and ailin "pool, lake" s.v. AY-, p. 349,See also the root √LĬNĬ "pool, mere, lake" (, p. 77). and that it is unclear if the name is supposed to be Quenya or Sindarin.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an early version of Galadriels Song of Eldamar, appears the lines:
And by the strand of Tirion there grew a golden Tree.
Beneath the stars of Ever eve in Eldamar it shone,
In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. 
But far away and far away beyond the Shadow-meres

A different version of the second line above was: Beneath the Hill of Ilmarin lies Aelinuial.The name Aelin-uial appears in The Silmarillion as a name for the Meres of Twilight in Beleriand., pp. 284, 292 (note 35)
