Kine of Araw were a species of cows that lived in fields in Rhûn near the Sea of Rhûn, and they were hardier and wilder than any other oxen in Middle-earth. Legends claimed that they were descended from the cattle of the Oromë, the Huntsman of the Valar, and so they were named the Kine of Araw (Oromë#Etymology being the Sindarin form of Oromës name).
The Kine were famous as the quarry of Vorondil the Hunter, ancestor of the Ruling Steward. It was he who cut a horn from one of these beasts and fashioned a hunting-horn from it, the Great Horn, which came to be carried by the eldest son of the Ruling Steward from Vorondils time onward. The last heir to bear the horn was Boromir, who saw it broken in two in his battle with Orcs beneath Amon Hen.
