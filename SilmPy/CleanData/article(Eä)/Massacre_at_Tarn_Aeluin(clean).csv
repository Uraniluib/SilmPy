The Massacre at Tarn Aeluin was an event during the First Age when Barahir the Bold and his ten outlaws were killed in their hideout by Tarn Aeluin, leaving only his son, Beren of the original band alive.  Though this was long sought for by Morgoth and his active servant Sauron, it was not until Gorlim betrayed their hiding place that it occurred.  Beren, upon returning to find his father and comrades dead, built a cairn over their bodies and swore an oath of vengeance.
Those who died were: Barahir, Gildor (outlaw), Belegund, Baragund, Urthel, Dagnir, Radhruin, Dairuin, Arthad, and Hathaldir.
