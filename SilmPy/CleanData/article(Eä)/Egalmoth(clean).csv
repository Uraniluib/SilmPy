Egalmoth, who lived during the First Age, was a Noldor Elves of Gondolin, the leader of the Folk of the Heavenly Arch.  He wore a blue mantle upon which stars were embroidered in crystal, and his sword was "bent" (none of the other Noldor carried curved swords).  However, he trusted more to his bow, for he could shoot high and far.
He was also one of the escorts King Turgon sent to accompany Aredhel on her way out of the Hidden City to her brother Fingon, along with Glorfindel and Ecthelion., p. 318.
He survived the Fall of Gondolin, and fled to the Mouths of Sirion.  He later died in the attack by the Sons of FÃ«anor.
==Etymology==
Egalmoth is formed by a consonant metathesis of the word aegamloth which means "A Spike upon a Flowered Crest" in Sindarin (from aeg = "point" and amloth = "flowered crest, implying a crest on a helmet").
