Legolas was an Elf of Gondolin.
== History ==
He was one of the House of the Tree, a scout under Galdor of the Tree.  Because of his keen eyes and knowledge of the mountainous area, he was chosen by the escapees of the Fall of Gondolin to be in front and guide them across the Cirith Thoronath.
Following the fall, he moved to Tol Eressëa, where he took the name Laiqalassë.
== Etymology ==
The meaning of Legolas was twofold: it could mean "Greenleaf" from Gnomish laigos ("greenness") and las ("leaf"), as well as "Keen sight", from leg, lêg ("keen, piercing") and last ("look, glance").
