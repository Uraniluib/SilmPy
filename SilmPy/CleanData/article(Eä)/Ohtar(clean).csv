Ohtar was the squire of Isildur.
==History==
Ohtar was apparently a Dúnedain of Arnor and by the first years of the Third Age he was fully trained and experienced and had attained the rank of "Soldier". He served as the squire of High King of the Dúnedain Isildur, and was dear to him.
He accompanied Isildurs retinue from Gondor to Arnor, when they were ambushed by the Gladden Fields. Ohtar was one of only three survivors of the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. He rescued the shards of Elendils sword, Narsil, and brought them safely back to Rivendell.
==Etymology==
On the name Ohtar, J.R.R. Tolkien writes: 
:Ohtar is the name only used in legends; but it is probably only the title of address that Isildur used at this tragic moment, hiding his feelings under formality. Ohtar warrior, soldier was the title of all who, though fully trained and experienced, had not yet been admitted to the rank of roquen, knight. But Ohtar was dear to Isildur and of his own kin., note 17.
