==History==
The mounds of the Barrow-downs in Eriador were built in the First Age by the ancestors of the Edain and their chieftains were buried there.
In the late Second Age and afterwards, the Tyrn Gorthad lay within the bounds of Arnor and later of Cardolan.  The DÃºnedain of Arnor used the barrows to bury their dead, such as the last prince of Cardolan, slain in the war of . 
The Witch-king of Angmar, though, sent evil Barrow-wights to inhabit the Barrow-downs, and they became a place of horror.
On 28 September  Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, Samwise Gamgee, and finally Frodo Baggins were captured by a Barrow-wights when they had wandered the downs after visiting Tom Bombadil.  Within the barrow (believed by some to be that of the last prince of Cardolan) Frodo awoke to see his friends lying on the floor looking deathly pale.  He heard a song or incantation and saw a long arm groping towards Sam.  Seizing a sword, Frodo hewed off the hand of the arm, then began speaking the rhyme that Tom had taught the hobbits.  Tom broke into the chamber and rescued the hobbits, and the sunlight destroyed the wight.
