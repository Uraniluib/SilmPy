Goblin-men were a people or race of creatures that were bred by Saruman. They were similar with the Half-orcs, at least in their resistance to the sunlight, an attribute that differentiated them from the full Orcs. They fought alongside Half-orcs, Hill-men and Dunlendings in the Battle of the Hornburg.
