Money, specifically minted coin money, was used in the Westlands as early as the Third Age.
  
==History==
In Gondor, the chief currency was the Castar; a small silver coin known as the Tharni was worth one-fourth of a Castar., p. 45
Azog threw a money purse at NÃ¡r containing "few coins of little worth" (which the Dwarves later stuffed in the mouth of Azogs decapitated head after his defeat).
When Bilbo Baggins rushed from his door to meet Thorin and his party of dwarves at the Green Dragon, he found himself outside without "a hat, a walking stick, or any money, or anything that he usually took with him when he went out".
After the death of Smaug and the destruction of Esgaroth the people were angry at the Master of Lake-town and declared, "We have had enough of the old men and the money-counters!"  Others took up the cry of "Up with the Bowman (meaning Bard) and down with Moneybags".
Much of the gold and silver wealth of Dwarf-horde of Smaug appears to have been minted.  Bilbo Baggins took home two chests from the horde, one containing gold and the other silver, and as a result (in addition to his familys pre-existing wealth) lived very comfortably for the next 50 years and was considered quite rich.  In addition to the Hobbits of Bree, the Hobbits of the Shire apparently dealt in coin money as well, otherwise they might not have been so eager to search Bag End after Bilbo left, looking for secret treasure rooms.
Money was mentioned in relation to the trading town of Bree.  At the end of the Third Age, a pony was considered to be worth about four silver pennies.  The well-to-do owner of the Prancing Pony, Barliman Butterbur, considered a loss of 30 silver pennies to be a considerable blow.  A gold piece was regarded as a particularly extravagant reward for good news.
Additionally, Bilbo is mentioned to have spent his last fifty ducats on the party in the first version of "A Long-expected Party".
When Aragorn and the four hobbits were camped on the side of Weathertop, Samwise Gamgee wandered to the edge of the dell.  Soon he came running back in fear and said, "I durstnt go outside this dell for any money."
==Background Information==
In The Complete Guide to Middle-earth by Robert Foster, the entry for "Money" on page 344 makes it a point to say 
  
The above phrase suggests that (in the early days of Tolkien fandom) there was some belief that coin money used as actual "currency" did not exist in Middle-earth; references to money are scarce, not highlighted and obviously forgettable among the narrative.
