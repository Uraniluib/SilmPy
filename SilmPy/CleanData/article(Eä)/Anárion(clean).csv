In The Peoples of Middle-earth, in Section VII "The Heirs of Elendil", Christopher Tolkien explained that there were three manuscripts in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the information about the Southern Line of Gondor, and from its condition it appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Anárions date of birth was  instead of . It was Isildur who was born in 3219 instead of 3209 and thus Anárion was the older of Elendils two sons.
