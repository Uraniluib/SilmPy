The name given to the calendar system used in Númenor throughout the Second Age, and in Gondor and Arnor throughout much of the Third Age. It divided the year into twelve months (properly called astar), and included three days that did not belong to any month: yestarë, loëndë and mettarë. The Kings Reckoning lasted until the loss of Eärnur the last Kings of Gondor. It was revised by Mardil, the first Ruling Steward, who replaced it with the system known as the Stewards Reckoning.
==Structure==
The year was divided into twelve months, with three days outside the months. These divisions are given in the table below.

!Relationship to the Shire CalendarBased on the statement in Appendix D that the day of the destruction of the One Ring, Shire 25 March in , "was, however, March 25 in both Kings and Stewards Reckoning." This may only apply around the end of the Third Age, since it is unknown if the Shire Calendar incorporated the Kings Reckoning 2-day "millennial additions" or any of the Stewards Reckoning additional adjustments. through Lithedays/Enderi/Overlithe through 30 Afterlithe|}
In leap years, loëndë was replaced with two enderi; this occurred in years divisible by 4 but not by 100 (haranyë), resulting in a 366-day year, similar to modern wikipedia:Gregorian calendar leap years. In addition, in years divisible by 1000 loëndë was replaced by three enderi, resulting in a 367-day year. These leap year rules held throughout the Second Age and continued based on the restarted numbering of Third Age years, and the 2-day "millennial additions" continued through . This calendar was replaced by the Stewards Reckoning in .
According to Jim Allan in An Introduction to Elvish, each of the elvish month names has a correspondence to the months of the Wikipedia:French Republican Calendar; for example, Nénimë/Pluviôse mean "Rainy", Súlìmë/Ventôse mean "Windy". Jim Allan suggests that Tolkien used this similarity because the French Republican Calendar was based on earlier unrecorded Germanic month names., p. 151
==Days of the week==
When the Kings Reckoning was first implemented the Númenóreans used the elven week of six days. At unspecified points of the Second Age two changes were made, the first being to rename the fourth day Aldúya to Aldëa (Orgaladh in Sindarin) in order to change the dedication to the White Tree, and the second being to insert an extra day, Eärenya (Oraearon), after the fifth day Menelya. Thus, the eventual Númenórean week was as follows:
