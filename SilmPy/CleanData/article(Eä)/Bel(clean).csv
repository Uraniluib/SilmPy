__NOTOC__
BEL, or MBEL, is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "large"., pp. 115, 150 (roots appearing as "BEL-, MBEL-", and "âˆšMELEK-")
It seems like J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with the form MELEK, signifying "great, mighty, powerful", when trying to devise an etymology for the name Morgoth. However, in what appears to be the later revision, Melkor was made a derivative of BEL, MBEL.
==Derivatives==
*Quenya: melek ("mighty"); melehta ("mighty"); melehte ("might, power (inherent)")
*Sindarin: beleg; belaith ("mighty")
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the The Etymologies appears the root BEL-, signifying "strong"., p. 352
