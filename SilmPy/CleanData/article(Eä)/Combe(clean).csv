Combe was a village that lay in a deep valley east of Staddle (which was on the eastern side of Bree-hill opposite of Bree).  
==Etymology==
The village took its name from its location. Old English cumb means "hollow, valley", cognate to Welsh cwm. Although the name is Old English, David Salo has suggested that it is intended to be a Celticism, like Bree, Archet and Chetwood.
The same element appears in "Deeping-coomb", a valley in the White Mountains.
