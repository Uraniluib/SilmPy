1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):

:Stephen Thorne provided the voice of Treebeard.  Thorne also sings the songs of The Lore of Living Creatures and 2 verses of the Song of the Ents and the Entwives. His participation in the destruction of Isengard is fully documented, but he is the only Ent given a voice in the production.  He also appears in the penultimate episode when the company pass through Isengard on their return.  As in the book, he reveals to Gandalf Sarumans departure from Orthanc.

2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Gimli.
:The Ents at the Entmoot initially decline Merry and Pippins request for help. Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards Isengard, claiming that it is the last place Saruman would look for them because it puts them so close to danger. Treebeard is initially confused, but ultimately succumbs to Pippins request. When Treebeard gets close to the forests edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Sarumans orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Sarumans war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents. They attack Isengard and manage to flood it.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Treebeard, fully CGI, makes some last appearances at Isengard.
