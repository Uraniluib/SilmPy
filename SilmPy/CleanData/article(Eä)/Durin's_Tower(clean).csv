Durins Tower was the tower upon the Celebdil. It was built by the Dwarves in ancient times on the peak of the Silvertine, which they called Celebdil - one of the three Mountains of Moria under which lay the realm of Moria. The tower was carved out of the living rock of the mountain and stood upon a high eyrie. The Endless Stair led to the tower from the foundations of the mountain.
By the end of the Third Age, Durins Tower had long been lost. Some Dwarves believed it had been destroyed, while others thought it was only a legend. On 23 January , Gandalf and the Durins Bane climbed the Endless Stair to Durins Tower. Upon the Silvertine they Battle of the Peak until Gandalf defeated the Balrogs 25 January. During the battle, the tower was destroyed and the entrance to the stair was blocked.
