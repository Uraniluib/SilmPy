Hill-trolls were a variety of trolls adapted for life among hills and moorland. 
==History==
Aragorn grandfather Arador was slain by hill-trolls in the Coldfells, north of Rivendell.
A company of these creatures were among the armies that Sauron loosed from the Morannon in the Battle of the Morannon.
==Characteristics==
In appearance they were man-like, but larger, and seem to have been covered with hard scales. They were fearsome and vicious, bellowing like beasts as they stormed into battle, and beating their enemies down with great hammers.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
