Lord of Andúnië was a title of the Númenóreans lords of the shoreland region of Andustar in western Númenor and ruled the city Andúnië.
As rulers of one of the divisions of Númenor the Lords of Andúnië were members of the Council of the Sceptre, and also were the highest lords of the Island and chief councellors of the Kings of Númenor., Note 23
Their symbol of office was a Sceptre of Annúminas which was afterwards held by the Kings of Arnor. The Lords also had inherited the Ring of Barahir from the royal house, Note 2, the Elendilmir from Silmariën, and were given the Palantiri by the Elves.
==History==
The fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil, was the first King whose eldest child was a daughter. Silmariën, as a woman, could not receive the Sceptre of Númenor and the King created the title of the Lords of Andúnië in favor of her son, Valandil (Lord of Andúnië).
In later times some of the Kings of Númenor would marry women from the royal line of the Lords of Andúnië. From these marriages came the Kings Ar-Sakalthôr and the wise King Tar-Palantir.
When the Shadow fell on the Kingdom, the Lords remained Faithful and became the leaders of the Elf-friends, but still retained their office during those dark times until Ar-Pharazôn stripped Amandil from his offices for supporting the Faithful. Amandils descendants would go on to found the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.
