Weather Hills was the name among Men for the north-south range of hills that lay in central Eriador, and in ancient times marked part of the border between the lands of Arthedain and Rhudaur. Weathertop, or Weathertop, lay at the southern end of the range. When Angmar was formed and Rhudaur became hostile to Arthedain, Argeleb I fortified the range but was later slain there by men of Rhudaur. Marks of this fortification still existed in the path Aragorn led the hobbits on to reach Weathertop.

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The Weather Hills form the boundary of Bree-land with the Lone-lands. A small river originated in the dell of Bleakrift a short distance north-west of Weathertop and flowed south-west into the Midgewater Marshes. The Midgewater Pass crossed this river, allowing passage into the hills north of the Great East Road. During the War of the Ring, the hills were infested with orcs, goblins, half-orcs and wargs both from Angmar and from Isengard. The Rangers of the North Candaith watched over the hills before travelling south as part of the Grey Company.
