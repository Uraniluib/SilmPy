The Rammas Echor was the great wall that surrounded the Pelennor Fields. It was one of the defensive works of Minas Tirith.
==Description==
It was a great wall, over 10 leagues in length, encircling the hitherto defenceless townlands of the city. At its furthest point, it was four leagues from the Great Gate of Minas Tirith. There were three main gates to the Pelennor; north, east and south. The eastern gate and accompanying watch-towers were known as the Causeway Forts and were the strongest section. It looked out over the road to Osgiliath and the banks of the Anduin. On the southern end, at Harlond (Gondor), the wall was only one league from the city.
==History==
This outer defence-work of the city of Minas Tirith was built by Stewards of Gondor Ecthelion II as part of the defences of Gondor, which had become necessary after the final loss of Ithilien in ., p. 546 It fell in ruin but was repaired on the order of Steward Denethor.
The Rammas was easily breached by the armies of Sauron under their Witch-king on 13 March . Denethor had put little guard on the Northern end, and the Causeway Forts were taken by the enemy at great loss.
==Etymology==
Rammas is Sindarin for "great wall". echor means "outer circle"., p. 512 The name therefore means "Great-wall circle"., p. 325, entry "Rammas Echor"
