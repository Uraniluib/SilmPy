__NOTOC__
MOR is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "black, dark". (root appearing as "√MOR"), pp. 73, 81 , 165 (root appearing as "√MOR-") (element appearing as "mor", signifying "dark")
==Derivatives==
*Quenya: morna ("black", adjective); mornie ("blackness", noun); more
*Sindarin: morn; môr
==Other versions==
In the The Etymologies appears the root MOR-, yielding Primitive Quendian mori ("black"). From this root derives such words as:, pp. 373-4
*Quenya: morna ("gloomy, sombre"); mordo ("shadow, obscurity, stain, smear, dimness")
*Noldorin: maur ("gloom"); Morn#Other versions ("black"), p. 35
*Ilkorin: môr ("night")
==Examples==
The element mor appears in a large number of compounds. Christopher Tolkien notes in the Etymologies that the entry MOR- is "extremely confused through changes and afterthought additions" and that it is not clear if "all the forms given were intended to stand". It can therefore be hard to know if the element mor in a compound is supposed to consist of a certain derivative of MOR. 
*Morannon
*Mordor
*Morgoth
*Morgul
*Moria
*Moriquendi
*Mormegil
*Morwen
==Inspiration==
Based on manuscripts held at the Cushing Memorial Library and Archives collection, Madeline J. Keyser has suggested that J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by a real-world word mora, which "seems to be of North (Scandinavian) and West Germanic origin — the Latin root is found in Modern English words such as murky, and in other Germanic words associated with darkness". A manuscript note appears to consist of the glosses mora "dark", moranya "darker", and moranta "darkest".
