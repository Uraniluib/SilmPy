The Battle Pit was the burial place for the ruffians killed in the Battle of Bywater.
On  3 November , 100 Ruffians fought over 300 Hobbits on the Bywater Road.  The Ruffians had foolishly walked into a trap within a banked portion of the road (which the hobbits secured with barricades at either end).  In the ensuing fight nearly seventy of the Men died.  The victorious hobbits loaded the bodies of their foes into wagons and hauled them to an old, nearby sand-pit for burial, which thereafter was called the Battle Pit.  Nineteen hobbits also died in the fray but they were buried separately, with honor in a hill-side grave.
