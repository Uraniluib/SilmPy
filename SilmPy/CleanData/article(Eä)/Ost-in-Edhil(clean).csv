Ost-in-Edhil ( – , existed for c. 947 years) was the capital city of Eregion, a kingdom of Noldor and Sindar in Eriador. It lay where the rivers Sirannon and Glanduin met.
==History==
Ost-in-Edhil was founded by Galadriel and Celeborn, before the time they ruled Lothlórien. The Elves began trading with the Dwarves of Moria and built a large road to connect the city with the Doors of Durin of the Dwarven kingdom. The Elves of Eregion also traded with the Men of Númenor. After the Númenóreans founded the city of Tharbad to the south of Ost-in-Edhil, Galadriel is recorded meeting with Tar-Aldarion before he took up the Sceptre of Númenor.
In time the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, a brotherhood of Elven craftsmen, was founded. They were led by Celebrimbor, the greatest smith since Fëanor. Sometime after  Galadriel left for Lothlórien and Celebrimbor became Lord of Ost-in-Edhil.
In  a mysterious craftsman named Annatar came to the city, offering his considerable talents. For 400 years they learned from him and together forged many Rings of Power. Annatar was, in truth, Sauron, who returned to Mordor to forge the One Ring. In  the Dark Lord returned with an army of Orcs and began the War of the Elves and Sauron. In  Celebrimbor was slain and Sack of Eregion.
Centuries later the Fellowship of the Ring encountered the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil shortly before reaching Moria.
==Etymology==
Ost-in-Edhil is Sindarin for "Fortress of the Elves" from ost "fortress" and edhel "elves".
