Beleriand (Sindarin, pron. ) was the region of north-western Middle-earth during the First Age.  Originally, the name belonged only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name was applied to the entire land. 
==Geography==
In the First Age, Beleriand was among the westernmost lands of Middle-earth., p. 44 Beleriand had a long western shoreline with the Great Sea Belegaer, including the Bay of Balar in its south-west. The Ered Luin (Blue Mountains) formed the eastern border of Beleriand, separating it from Eriador. To the south, Beleriand was bound by the Great Gulf., p. 306 North of Beleriand were the highland regions of Hithlum,, p. 112 Dorthonion, and Lothlann., p. 147 Some people considered the land of Nevrast to be part of Beleriand, while others considered it part of Hithlum.
The River Sirion, the chief river of Beleriand, running north to south, divided it into West Beleriand and East Beleriand.  Crossing it east to west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as Andram, the Long Wall.  (The river sank into the ground at the Fens of Sirion, and re-emerged below the Andram at the Gates of Sirion.)  To the east of the Long Wall, was the River Gelion and its six tributaries draining the Ered Luin, in Ossiriand or the Land of Seven Rivers.  The River Brithon and the River Nenning were the two lesser rivers of the western land of Falas.
By , Beleriand was mostly destroyed and submerged under the sea from the War of Wrath of the Valar against Morgoth. Only a small section of East Beleriand remained, and was known as Lindon.
In addition, fulfilling a prophecy, the graves of Túrin and Morwen survived as the island Tol Morwen.  Likewise part of Dorthonion became Tol Fuin, and the Hill of Himring became the island of Himling.  All of these together were known as the Western Isles.

==Etymology==
Beleriand translates to "The Country of Ossë" with the ending -ian for places and countries. The OS form could have been *Balariande (a i-affection to e because of the following i). 
The element Balar refers to Ossë, who often dwelt at the shores (although this refers to the earlier Legendarium when Osse and Uinen were Valar of the sea, not Maiar of Ulmo)., entry BAL It was from Balar that the Teleri expanded and "colonised" the region of Beleriand, hence the name.
The Qenya name Valariande is also given.
===Nomenclature===
The name Beleriand originally applied only to the region around the Bay of Balar whence the name, before expanded to refer to the wider region. Properly Beleriand does not refer to the Northlands such as Anfauglith, or the eastern lands of Thargelion; Nevrast and Dorthonion are "grey areas", p. 41. However the term "Beleriand" is sometimes used collectivelly in fandom to include all those submerged lands.

The Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North (1977) shows only a portion of the region, with few common points to the better-known Third Age Westlands maps of The Lord of the Rings; the only explicit common references are the Blue Mountains, which formed the boundary between Beleriand and Eriador, and the information that in the Third Age, Lindon was part of Ossiriand that survived Beleriands destruction at the end of the First Age.
File:Sage - Beleriand and Eriador collage.png envisioned Beleriand relative to Eriador. The rectangle marks the region shown in the The Silmarillion map (canon); the rest, including the Thangorodrim, are Fonstads extrapolations.
In 1979, Charles NoadCharles Noad, "A Note on the Geography of the First Age" in Amon_Hen_(journal) no. Amon_Hen_38, April 1979, reprinted in Mallorn_(journal) no. Mallorn_27, September 1990, p. 40. made an attempt to reconstruct a general map of Beleriand and Eriador. Using only the few distance indications from the text of The Silmarillion, Noads very early attempt is remarkable as it proves very accurate despite being published before Unfinished Tales (where the island of Himling was first depicted, with Tol Fuin mentioned westwards) and The History of Middle-earth.
Ten years later, Ronald KyrmseRonald Kyrmse, "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in Mallorn_(journal) no. Mallorn_26, September 1989, pp. 25–27. independently proposed his own map reconstruction, aligning the isle of Himling with the hill of Himring. Kyrmse also identified Dolmed on the early map of Beleriand as being the same as a mountain on the Unfinished Tales map (depicted slightly apart of the mountain range and north of the wooden area in Forlindon), proving that Dolmed still existed in the Third Age (being too far north from the Gulf of Lune to have been destroyed). He might therefore have been the first to discover that Dolmed survived the destruction of Beleriand at the end of the First Age.
In 1991, Karen Wynn Fonstad faced the same problems when she attempted to make a world-map of Arda. She found a solution by combining an early map for The Lord of the Rings (published in The Treason of Isengard), p. 302 and an early map for the Silmarillion (published in The Lost Road and Other Writings),, "Second Silmarillion Map" pp. 408-411 both being prototypes for the published maps by Christopher Tolkien. She aligned Tol Fuin with Taur-nu-Fuin and Himling with Himring and filled the rest of the outline with some inspiration from the :File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map V.png by Tolkien. She brought the coast near that of Belfalas, continued the course of Gelion to the south-west, extended the south-western tip to emphasize the Bay of Balar, and assumed that area as forested, a continuation of Taur-im-Duinath.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 3 While the Iron Mountains do not appear in the canonical map, Fonstad drew them as a continuation to her imagined range of Iron Hills—Grey Mountains—Mountains of Angmar.
In the early 1990s, Didier Willis independently made the same attempt using the map from Unfinished Tales that shows Himling; the second map of Beleriand, which was published in The War of the Jewels and indicates distances;, pp. 182-185 and the draft map of the lands east of the Blue Mountains published in The Treason of Isengard, which also indicates distances. Quite similar to Noad and Kymrses earlier attempts, Willis interpretation shows a slightly smaller Beleriand than Fonstads and places the First Age Bay of Balar closer to the Third Age Gulf of Lune.Hiswelóce (fanzine, French), special issue no. 1, La Faculté des Etudes Elfiques, 1994; http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Mont Dolmed & cités naines — « Lhúndirien » ou le recollage du Beleriand et de lEriador, revised and improved version in Willis, Didier (editor), Tolkien, le façonnement dun monde (2014), vol. 2, pp. 197-230. Not knowing Kyrmses earlier interpretation, Willis also independently recognized Dolmed on the early map of Beleriand and criticized Fonstad and Robert Foster who suggested the opposite.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth p. 34Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, entry Dolmed
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Beleriand had many different names in Tolkiens early writings, as found in The History of Middle-earth: Broseliand/Broceliand, Golodhinand, Noldórinan, Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand (the latter was later used as a name for another realm).
==Inspiration==
The early names Broceliand/Broseliand affirms that Tolkien was inspired by the legendary forest of Wikipedia:Brocéliande.
