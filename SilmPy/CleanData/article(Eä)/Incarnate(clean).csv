The Incarnate (Mirröanwi in Quenya, pp. 325, 350) races were those beings whose natural state is to exist as a union of fëa and hröa. These races were Elves, Men, and Dwarves.
==Etymology==
Mirröanwi, singular Mirröanwë, is a Quenya word meaning "Incarnates". It is used in reference to the Children of Ilúvatar, who were designed to live as Fëa and hröa.
Patrick H. Wynne has suggested that Mirröanwi can be analyzed as containing mi ("in") and hröa ("body")., p. 34
