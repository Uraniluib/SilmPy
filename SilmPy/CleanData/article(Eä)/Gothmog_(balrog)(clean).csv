Gothmog (Sindarin, pron. ) was the Lord of Balrogs and the High-captain of Angband, one of the chief servants of the Dark Lord Morgoth with a rank equal to that of Sauron.
==History==
Gothmog was apparently one of the Maiar that followed Morgoth to exile, and because of either his brilliant mind or because of his ability to assume an immensely powerful physical form, he was made the Lord of Balrogs.
At the Dagor-nuin-Giliath he mortally wounded Fëanor, but called a retreat upon the approach of the Sons of Fëanor with a sizable force.  He next appeared at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where he was also named high-captain of Angband, again inferring his power and status as essentially Morgoths right-hand Balrog (Sauron, another spirit, played a more domestic than front-line role for his master).  There at the Nirnaeth he slew Fingon, thus allowing him to boast of having slain two of the five High Kings of the Noldor.  He also captured Húrin alive in this battle on Morgoths command, despite this order allowing Húrin to slaughter of many of Gothmogs troll-guard.
He was again deployed as Morgoths front-line commander in the Fall of Gondolin, where he was slain by Ecthelion of the Fountain.  According to the (albeit non-canonical) text, Gothmog piled his iron siege equipment against the North Gate of Gondolin until it broke from sheer pressure.  The same text states that he also took a front-line position against Rog, turning the tide in that part of the battle.  More confirmed canonically, he beat down Tuor in single combat, but the elf-lord Ecthelion, who was badly wounded, rose and stood over him.  Ecthelion stood no chance against the Lord of Balrogs, and lost his sword in the brief struggle.  But then Ecthelion leaped forward, and stabbed Gothmog in the breast with the spike atop his helm.  They both fell into the Fountain of the King, where Gothmog, if not already killed by the spike, drowned with his opponent.

==Etymology==
The name Gothmog is derived from the roots GOS-/GOTH- "dread", and MBAW- "compel, force, subject, oppress" (found also in the title for Morgoth "Bauglir": the tyrant or oppressor).
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Gothmogs original name was Kalimbo.
Kalimbo (also called Kosomot, p. 93 or Kosmoko, p. 216) was the son of the Valar Morgoth and the Ogres Fluithuin, as conceived in the earliest versions of the legendarium. Kalimbo is described as a "savage, uncivilized man, barbarian; Giants, monster, Trolls"., entry for Kalimbo J.R.R. Tolkien later changed his name to Gothmog. 
In the character list appended to The Fall of Gondolin (chapter) Gothmog was described as "a son of Morgoth and the ogress Fluithuin," but eventually, the idea that the Valar had Valarindi was discarded altogether.
In one of Tolkiens early Middle-earth writings, The Lay of the Children of Húrin, "Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs" is mentioned. It is not, however, certain if it was another name for Gothmog, or it simply meant "a Balrog lord". According to Christopher Tolkien, the latter is more probable, as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkiens mythology., Commentary on Part I of the second version
