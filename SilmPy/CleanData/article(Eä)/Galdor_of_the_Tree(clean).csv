In late writings, J.R.R. Tolkien considered that Galdor of the Trees and Galdor of the Havens may have been the same,, Glorfindel, note 1 but ultimately rejected the notion. If Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the Valar, and thus had fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like Glorfindel did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in The Lord of the Rings suggests., Glorfindel, note 3 For this reason Tolkien speculated that "Galdor" was simply a common Sindarin name.
