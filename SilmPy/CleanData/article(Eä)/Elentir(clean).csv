 
Elentir was a character that J.R.R. Tolkien created and then abandoned during the writing of the Akallabêth.  Tolkien originally wrote that Tar-Míriel, the daughter of Tar-Palantir, was forced to marry her cousin, Ar-Pharazôn.  After completing and then expanding a second version of the Akallabêth Tolkien toyed with a different version of their relationship and introduced Elentir, the son of Númendil and the brother of Amandil as part of this new concept., Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, p. 159  In four separate texts, labeled (a) through (d), Christopher Tolkien set forth the "rise and fall" of Elentir:
* In text (a), Elentir was in love with Zimrahil (an early name for Míriel) but she became infatuated by Pharazôns beauty and wealth.  Despite the laws of Númenor the two first cousins married., Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, p. 160
* In text (b), Elentir was betrothed to Zimrahil when she turned to Pharazôn.  This text was written in very poor handwriting so the course of the story was obscured., Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, p. 161
* In text (c), Elentir loved Zimrahil, she loved him, and they were about to be betrothed when...  At this point this abandoned text ended but it appeared that soon Zimrahil would have turned to Pharazôn., Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, p. 162
* In text (d), Elentir and the story of Zimrahils love for Pharazôn are absent.
Christopher concluded that (b) and (c) were not expansions on (a) but simply repetitions, and that (d) represented a final abandonment of the alternate version of the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn.  With a return to the original concept of a forced marriage there was no need for the character Elentir and so he vanished., Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, p. 163
