==History==
After Finwës first wife Míriel died he lived in grief for many years.  Ingwë, wishing to lighten his heart, invited him to leave Túna and come visit him where the light of the Two Trees might bring him healing.  As he approached the house of Ingwë on the west slopes of Oiolossë, Ingwës daughter Indis saw Finwë and sang a song of joy to him, which was "as a song of the lirulin in the sky."  Seeing Indis at this moment caused Finwë to fall in love with her and a year later the two were wed.
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
