The Standard of Elendil was a standard that Aragorn bore on the Paths of the Dead, made by Arwen.  It had a black field, with seven stars wrought of gems, a White Tree of Gondor for Gondor, and a crown wrought of mithril and gold.  These were the signs of the house of Elendil, which Aragorn unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
