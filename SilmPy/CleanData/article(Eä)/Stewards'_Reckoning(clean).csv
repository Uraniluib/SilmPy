Stewards Reckoning, also known as the Revised Calendar, was the calendar system introduced in Gondor by its first Ruling Steward, Mardil, in Third Age 2060. It replaced the previous system known as the Kings Reckoning and, following the War of the Ring, it was replaced by the New Reckoning.
==Background==
Arnor and Gondor used a Númenóreans calendar called the Kings Reckoning. Even after the fall of Númenor near the end of the Second Age, the old calendar was maintained by the Exiles of Númenor in Middle-earth well into the Third Age. When the era of the Kings passed with the Battle of Fornost and the loss of King Eärnur, the Kings Reckoning presented (due to resetting the "Kings Reckoning#Structure" with the new count of Third Age years) an offset of about 2 daysWayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, "Appendix D", p. 729 out of synchronicity with the wikipedia:Tropical year.The length of the wikipedia:Tropical year given in Appendix D was 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46 seconds.
==History==
To correct the accumulating deficit of the calendar, Steward Mardil inserted two leap days into . In addition, he reformed the calendar, to take effect in , by making all months of equal length at 30 days and arranging the two extra days as holidays outside of the months. In  Steward Hador (Steward of Gondor) added 1 day to that year. There were no millennial additions in , but by the end of the Third Age the calendar was in deficit by less than 1 day.
The Stewards Reckoning was eventually adopted by most speakers of Westron.
In , the calendar was replaced by the New Reckoning.
==The Calendar==
The Revised Calendar consisted of twelve months, each of thirty days, and five additional days that belonged to no month. The months were taken from those of the Kings Reckoning, with the change that the seventh and eighth months were shortened to thirty days, and the two days placed outside the months as tuilérë, meaning Spring-day, and yáviérë, meaning Autumn-day.

!Relationship to the Shire CalendarBased on the statement in Appendix D that the day of the destruction of the One Ring, Shire 25 March in , "was, however, March 25 in both Kings and Stewards Reckoning." This may only apply around the end of the Third Age, since it is unknown if the Shire Calendar incorporated the Kings Reckoning 2-day "millennial additions" or any of the Stewards Reckoning additional adjustments. through 1 Thrimidge through 1 Forelithe through Lithedays/Enderi/Overlithe through 29 Afterlithe through 29 Wedmath through 29 Halimath|}
The names of the months and days were popularly used in Quenya, though the Dúnedain adhered to Sindarin versions.

==Controversy==
Tolkien stated that the deficit remaining after Mardils 2-day addition to  was "about 8 hours". The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion states that the remaining deficit at the end of  should have amounted to "2 hours, 16 minutes, 40 seconds".
Some have suggested (including The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion) that Tolkiens "about 8 hours" deficit refers to the end of , but only if the leap day in  was dropped in consequence.
Andreas Möhn goes further in his blog post "https://lalaithmesp.blogspot.de/2018/03/tolkien-has-reckoned-correct-after-all.html Tolkien has reckoned correct after all", speculating that Tolkien "failed to specify" additional Stewards Reckoning rules, which would explain the deficit figures published in Appendix D.
https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Kings_Reckoning_Rules_and_Deficit.html Paul Sarando suggests instead that a simpler explanation for 
Tolkiens puzzling "about 8 hours" may have been the result of a mathematical shortcut of using the deficit calculation for the end of Second Age 5501 (which would have been the same year as  if the count of Second Age years had continued) instead of correctly calculating the deficit for  plus the end of .
