The exiled King, Helm, was driven into hiding in the mountains. During the Long Winter Wulfs armies besieged him at Hornburg, and Helms nephew, Fréaláf at Dunharrow. Helm and his second son died of the cold. In the spring, Helm was avenged by Fréaláf, who led a small party into Edoras and killed King Wulf in . With help from Gondor, Fréaláf cleared Wulfs followers from Rohan, and succeeded his uncle Helm to become its tenth rightful King.
