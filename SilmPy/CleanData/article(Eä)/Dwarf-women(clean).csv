Dwarf-women were few among the Dwarves, kept in secret, and were seldom seen by other races. 
==Role in society==
Dwarves wanted their women to be protected from other races and they usually kept them concealed inside their mountain halls. They seldom traveled in the outside world, only in great need, and when they did, they were dressed as men; with similar voice and appearance as male dwarves, even when they are rarely seen they are usually mistaken for a male. All Dwarves had beards from the beginning of their lives; a similar statement was made in The_Making_of_Appendix_A#Durins_Folk.
===Family and fertility===
Women joined their husbands families. Women were seldom named in genealogies but if a son is seen to be 110 years younger than his father, this usually indicates an elder daughter. Thorins sister Dís was named simply because of the gallant death of her sons Fíli and Kíli.
Gimli stated that only approximately one-third of their population consisted of women, which was the reason for the slow increase in population of the race.  Moreover, while Dwarf-men outnumbered Dwarf-women two to one, less than half of Dwarf-men actually married:  many preferred to spend their time with their crafts instead.  Meanwhile, many Dwarf-women never took a husband either:  some desire none, or desired one who could not or would not marry them, in which case they would have no other.
==Misconceptions==
Because of the scarcity of Dwarf-women, their secrecy and similarity in appearance to males, and their lack of mention, many Men failed to recognize their existence. They believed that the Dwarves population was only of men, and a legend said therefore that they were born by growing out of stone.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
File:David T. Wenzel - Dwarf-woman.jpg - Dwarf-woman1989: The Hobbit (comic book):
:During Thorins and Gandalfs narration about Lonely Mountain and Smaug, a flashback panel shows the exodus of the Dwarves of Erebor. Among them, a woman can be seen, since she has no beard and is wearing womans clothes.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:Dwarf women are mentioned in the Extended Edition only, during Gimlis rant to Éowyn concerning Dwarven culture. The dialogue actually reproduces some of the information seen in Appendix A: Durins Folk. On his mention that Men believe that there are no female Dwarves, Aragorn whispers a tongue-in-cheek explanation "Its the beards!" causing Éowyn to laugh.
2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Some Dwarf women can be seen briefly in the beginning of the film, when the story of the destruction of Erebor is told. Some women have beards, whilst some have sideburns of varying length.
