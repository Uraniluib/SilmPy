__NOTOC__
Gúthwinë was the sword of Éomer, borne by him at the Battle of the Hornburg, where he drew it alongside Aragorn to drive away the wild men battering the gate of the Hornburg.  Presumably Éomer also used Gúthwinë at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where he cast his sword into the sunlight and sang as he caught it, upon seeing the Standard of Elendil appear on the lead ship approaching on the Anduin.
