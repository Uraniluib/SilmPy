South Gondor, known in Sindarin as Harondor, was a disputed region south of Ithilien, between the rivers Poros and Harnen.  The Harad Road ran across South Gondor. Its climate was described as fluctuating between mild winters and very hot and dry summers., pp. 183, 185 Ongoing wars led to the regions downfall and by the end of the Third Age, Harondor was said to be a deserted land.
==History==
Historically, this region was a part of Gondor. It was absorbed by Gondor during the height of its power, perhaps the expansions of Tarannon Falastur., "The Third Age - Kingdoms of the Dunedain", p. 55
Harondor was part of Gondor until the Kin-strife and frequent assaults and invasions by the Corsairs of Umbar and the Haradrim meant that, by the later years of the Third Age, Gondor lost control over this region. 
Fengels two older brothers, Folcred and Fastred (son of Folcwine), were killed in Harondor while fighting for Gondor in , meaning that even by the late Third Age, it had not given up its claims to the region. However, by the time of the War of the Ring all the land south of the river Poros was occupied by the Haradrim.
During the War of the Ring, Harondor was often described as a "debatable and desert land" on maps.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin word Harondor seems to contain har- (as in Harad, meaning "south") and Gondor, with initial G- lenition to zero in compounds.
