Bag End was built into the Hill by Bungo Baggins, where he went to live with his new wife, Belladonna Took. The hole was largely financed by her. The earth removed was shot over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground; this lane would thenceforth be known as "Bagshot Row"., p. 763-5 The hole was inherited by Bungos son Bilbo Baggins, who employed Holman Greenhand, Hamfast Gamgee, and later Samwise Gamgee to tend to its gardens.
Bag End in turn was left to Bilbos adopted heir, Frodo Baggins, in . When he too left the Shire, he sold it to his cousin Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, who had coveted it for years. It was used by her son Lotho Sackville-Baggins as he declared himself Chief Shirriff. Saruman also adopted the hole as his base, digging up Bagshot Row and erecting many houses in its stead. After the Battle of Bywater, it was largely restored to normal, and Frodo took up residence in the hole again.
After Frodo Baggins left Middle-earth, he gave Bag End to Samwise Gamgee, whose family, the Gardners, would live in it for many years.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkiens aunt Jane Neaves farm was called Bag End by the locals in Dormston, Worcestershire.

The name can also be seen as a pun on "cul-de-sac" (literally "bottom of the bag").
In the books, it is supposedly a translation of the Westron Laban-neg, Labin-nec, which has much the same meaning, and the same relationship to the Westron form of Baggins: Labingi.

The pantry was designed to be overly-stocked whilst the whole home - especially the bedroom - was stuffed with plump furnishings to reflect Bilbos "comfortable" lifestyle.Daniel Falconer, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design, pp. 16-20
