The Lords of Dor-lómin ruled Dor-lómin, a realm of the Edain in northern Beleriand. As a young man, Hador gained the favour of Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, while serving in his household. Fingolfin granted him the lordship of Dor-lómin, where Hador then gathered his kin. His son and grandson succeeded him as Lords and were vassals of the High King Fingon.

==History==
Within their own household, the Lords of Dor-lómin spoke Sindarin, but at times still used their Taliska. They were on good terms with the Eldar, and formed marital ties with the houses of House of Bëor and House of Haleth. 
Dor-lómin ceased to exist as a realm of the Edain following the battle of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, when all of Hithlum was occupied by Easterlings, in the service of Morgoth, who enslaved the Edain. Húrin was held prisoner in Angband while his son Túrin was sent away to Doriath. From this point, Dór-lomin was ruled by Brodda of the Easterlings, until he was killed by Túrin in his own hall. Despite a brief uprising by the Edain, the Easterlings retained control of the land.
