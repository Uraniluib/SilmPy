 
Edrahil was an Elves of Nargothrond, the chief of the ten who remained loyal to Finrod at the time he set out with Beren on the Quest for the Silmaril.  He was the one who lifted Finrods cast-down crown and asked that it be given to a steward until the king returned.  Later he died in the dungeon of Minas Tirith (Beleriand).
