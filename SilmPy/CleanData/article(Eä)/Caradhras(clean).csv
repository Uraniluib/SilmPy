Caradhras (Sindarin, pron. ) was one of the mightiest peaks in the Misty Mountains.

Caradhras was the tallest and northernmost of the Mountains of Moria, the three mountains which the great Dwarves city of Moria was built under. The other two were Celebdil (Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Caradhras was described as "mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides". In the light of the rising or setting sun it appeared "dull red as if stained with blood".
Caradhras was called the Cruel by the Dwarves and had long had a bad reputation. It was the site in Middle-earth where mithril was found and where Durins Folk woke Durins Bane, the Balrogs of Moria.
==The Redhorn Gate==
The Redhorn Gate (also called the Redhorn Pass) was a narrow and dangerous pass through the Misty Mountains that led from the wilds of Eriador through to Rhovanion beyond. Sheer and steep, it climbed across the southern slopes of Caradhras and led down into the Dimrill Dale and hence the Vale of Anduin beyond the Mountains.
The Redhorn Gate was known to be treacherous. It was on this pass in  that Celebrían, the wife of Elrond, was captured by Orcs of the Misty Mountains. This was also the pass used by the hobbits migrating from Gladden Fields into Eriador.
After the fall of Moria, this pass was predominantly used by elves travelling between Lothlórien and Eriador. On 11 January - 12 January, , the Fellowship of the Ring attempted to cross the Misty Mountains by the Redhorn Gate. They came into a fierce blizzard and could not go any further due to the deep snow. So they were defeated by the ill will of the mountain and were forced to cross under the Misty Mountains through the Mines of Moria.
==Etymology==
The name is Sindarin and means Redhorn. It is composed of caran "red" and ras "horn". As a compound, the contact of n next to r presents a phenomenon similar to prestanneth: Caran-ras is assimilated to Caradhras.
Barazinbar (or also Baraz) is the literal Khuzdul translation of "Redhorn".
==Portrayal in adaptations==
In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring by Peter Jackson the violent snowstorms on the mountain are caused by Saruman and not the mountain itself. In his magic, Saruman mentions the Neo-Elvish name of Caradhras as Carnirasse.
