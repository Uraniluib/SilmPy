Isildurâ€™s Bane was a name for the One Ring.  After Saurons defeat in the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur, Elendils son took the Ring, and later journeyed northward with it to his kingdom of Arnor.  On 5 October  his small party was ambushed by Orcs.  Isildurs small force was cut down and he fled the battle wearing the Ring. It slipped from his finger, though, and so both Isildur and the Ring were lost.
On 20 June , Sauron attacked Osgiliath.  On the eve of this assault a dream came to Faramir, Boromirs brother, that warned of the awakening of Isildurs Bane.  Faramir had the dream often and Boromir had it once.  After consulting with Denethor, Boromir journeyed for one hundred and ten days to seek advice from Elrond.  Finally on 25 October Boromir received the answers to his questions at the Council of Elrond, where Frodo Baggins brought out the Ring and Elrond proclaimed, "Behold Isildurs Bane!"
