 
Ragnir (mentioned in "The Wanderings of Húrin") was the youngest of the seven followers of Húrin  after he was released from Angband and came to Hithlum., p. 262  Ragnir was more pessimistic than his companion Asgon, as seen after Húrin abandoned his followers, but was willing to follow Asgons lead.
When Húrin left Hithlum (where he had been shunned since it was suspected that he had sided with Morgoth) seven followers accompanied him., p. 253  As the small party descended from the Ered Wethrin into the Vale of Sirion, Húrin conceived the desire to return to Gondolin, which was near, but could not tell the others since he had sworn not to reveal its location.  One night near the Brithiach Húrin waited until the others slept and then he slipped away., p. 261
When it was found that Húrin had disappeared, Ragnir suggested going home since to him it was clear that Húrins wits had gone.  Asgon stoutly said that Húrin was their lord and that they must find and follow him.  Since Húrin had mentioned an errand in nearby Brethil Asgon said they should seek him there.  Ragnir wanted to know by whose leave they could enter the land since strangers were unwelcome.  Asgon said that the Men of Brethil were good and argued that they would be welcomed since the Lord of Brethil was akin to the House of Hador.  Since Asgon was known for his stout heart and good luck the party followed him into the forest.
The party was captured by the guardians of Brethil and brought before the new lord, who scorned them, suspected them of spying, and ejected them from the land.  He had ordered their weapons taken but fortunately one of the border-guards, Ebor, gave them back.
Once safely away from Brethil, Ragnir wryly noted that Asgons luck had held since they were still alive.  Asgon still wanted to seek Húrin and suggested that the company go to the Crossings of Taeglin to hear any news.  Ragnir commented that they might hear bow-strings instead, but went with the others.  Unfortunately the detailed story of Húrins wanderings was left unfinished so what became of Ragnir is unknown.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When Túrin was a child there was a servant of his mother Morwen who was also named Ragnir (servant), but he was blind and thus would not have been the same person as the Ragnir who followed Húrin many years later.  In a rejected draft manuscript of "The Wanderings of Húrin" Ragnir was called "Ragnir the Hunter"., note 24, p. 302
