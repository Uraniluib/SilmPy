Overhill was a small village in the Westfarthing, to the north of Hobbiton and Hobbiton Hill, marking the end of the short road that ran past Bag End and Bagshot Row. Though the Boffin Family was generally associated with The Yale in the Eastfarthing of the Shire, there was at least one Boffin who lived in Overhill: an apparently well-to-do Hobbits who employed Samwise Gamgee cousin Halfast Gamgee.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the original map of the Shire, Overhill was named "Northope"., Boffin of the Yale.
