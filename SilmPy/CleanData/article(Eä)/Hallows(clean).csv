The Hallows or the Tombs were a place in Minas Tirith where Kings of Gondor, Stewards of Gondor and other important men of the realm were buried. It was built on the shoulder of the hill, belonged to the fourth level of the city and accessed through the sixth, by passing the Fen Hollen to Rath Dínen.  The Hallows contained the House of the Kings and the House of the Stewards.
On 15 March  the Steward Denethor brought his son Faramir to the Hallows where he intended to burn both of them alive.  The guard Beregond tried to save Faramir but was held up by Denethors servants.  Beregond had killed two of the servants in the Hallows before Gandalf, alerted by Peregrin Took, came and rescued Faramir.  Denethor though succeeded in taking his own life.
After Aragorn had become King he passed judgement upon Beregond for the spilled blood in the Hallows.  Aragorn banished Beregond from Minas Tirith but mercifully let him live and honored him by appointing him to the White Company, the Guard of Faramir, newly become the Prince of Ithilien.
Borondir, a soldier of Gondor whose deeds in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant earned him great renown, was laid in tomb in the Hallows after his death in that battle.
King Théoden was temporarily placed in the Hallows after his death until his body was brought back to Rohan.
The Hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, of the Fellowship of the Ring, were also given a place there after their deaths, beside the tomb of King Aragorn., S.R. 1484
