The Host of the North was Morgoths army during War of Wrath. The army was comprised of Orcs, Balrogs, and Dragons (led by Ancalagon). Most of the army was destroyed at the end of the First Age by the Host of the West. Some of the survivors eventually fell under Sauron influence and helped bring about the Dark Years.
