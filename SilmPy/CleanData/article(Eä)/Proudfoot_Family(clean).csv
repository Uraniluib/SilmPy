The Proudfoot Family was a family of Shire-hobbits of the Shire.
If Odo Proudfoot is to be taken as an example, at least some members of the family boasted large and exceptionally (even for Hobbits) hairy feet.
There is some uncertainty among Hobbits about the plural form of "Proudfoot" - the family themselves apparently used "Proudfeet", but Bilbo Baggins pointedly preferred "Proudfoots".
