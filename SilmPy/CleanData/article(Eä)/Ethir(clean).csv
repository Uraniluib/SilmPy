ethir is the form of two unrelated Sindarin words (homophones) with different meanings:
==Ethir.1==
"mouth of a river, estuary"
===Etymology===
It is derived from Primitive Quendian etsiri, entry ET
It can be analyzed as ed + sîr (s reduced to h because of lenition).
===Pronunciation===
There is some controversy on the pronunciation of the word regarding the digraph thJim Allan (ed.) An Introduction to Elvish, "Proto-Eldarin vowels" by Christopher Gilson.
One view says that it can be viewed as a compound: ed/et + sîr would trigger a lenition ed/et + hîr. If preposition and stem are understood as different entities, t/h should be pronounced separately () (like English "at-home").
Another view would be that PQ etsiri evolved as Old Sindarin *etthireDidier Willis Sindarin Dictionary version of 2001; containing etymological reconstructions by David Salo before simplified as ethir. In that case the PQ cluster ts was directly derived as th in Sindarin. The word would be pronounced as .
==Ethir.2==
"spy"
===Etymology===
Derived from ed + tirn.  Examples include Amon Ethir.
