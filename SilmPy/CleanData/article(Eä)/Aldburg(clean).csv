Aldburg was one of the oldest towns in Rohan and the first capital of the realm., "Appendix", footnote 2
==History==
Aldburg was built by Eorl in the region known as the Folde, east of Edoras. After Brego, son of Eorl, completed the Meduseld and the Kings removed to Edoras, the lordship of Aldburg passed to his third son, Eofor, from whom Éomund, father of Éomer, claimed descent.
Even though Aldburg was in the Kings Lands as part of the Folde, it was the location of the muster of the East-mark as it was the most convenient location. At the time of the War of the Ring, it was the home of King Théodens nephew Éomer, who was Third Marshal of the Riddermark.
