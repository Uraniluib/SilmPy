The Rhimdath or Rushdown was a short, early tributary of the Anduin River. It flowed from the Misty Mountains eastward into the Anduin roughly halfway between the Langwell-Greylin confluence and the Carrock., p. 205 Given the name "Rushdown" it probably had a steep gradient.
The river-name is found as a pencilled addition by J.R.R. Tolkien on the :File:CJRT - Map of Wilderland.jpg in one of his copies of The Hobbit. It has been noted that Rhimdath (according to the map) seems to have been joined by another small mountain stream.http://www.tuckborough.net/rivers.html#Rushdown Rivers & Falls: Rushdown at http://www.tuckborough.net/ The Thains Book (accessed 29 April 2011)
The river-name is also a feature of the first map of The Lord of the Rings in The Treason of Isengard. On Map II, in square J-12, both "R.Rushdown" and "Rhimdad" are written next to the short Anduin tributary north of the Carrock., p. 305
==Etymology==
The first element in Rhimdath is related to Noldorin rhib-, rhimp, rhimmo ("to flow like a ?torrent"), derived from the Sundocarme RIP ("rush, fly, fling"). Christopher Tolkien stated that the name Rhibdath or Rhimdath, given the meaning "Rushdown", was a hastily scribbled addition at the end of the R-stems., p. 384 In the index he noted that this name only appeared in the The Etymologies but is the river described above., p. 446This was before the publication of The Return of the Shadow.
As the stem DAT is glossed as "fall down",, p. 354 it is possible that the second element in Rhimdath is a derivative of this stem.
