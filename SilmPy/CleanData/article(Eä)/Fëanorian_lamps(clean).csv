Fëanorian lamps were lamps which emitted a blue light from a flame from within a white crystal. They are described as "crystals hung in a fine chain net, the crystals being ever shining with an inner blue radiance". The lamps were created in Valinor and the flame could not  be extinguished by wind or water  The Noldor were famous for the flames, but unfortunately the craft was lost with them.  Gelmir (messenger of Círdan) possessed one of these lamps when he met Tuor.
Some of the Noldor who had been captured by Morgoth and put to work in his mines had Fëanorian lamps with them.  Gwindor was one of these enslaved Elves; when he escaped he took with him one of these lamps.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
The lamps were part of the legendarium, but Christopher Tolkien did not include any such reference in the published Silmarillion. For example, in one version of the story Túrin Turambar recognised the face of Beleg whom he had slain by the light of Gwindors lamp;, note 2 yet in the version included in the Silmarillion, it was lightning which revealed Belegs face to Túrin.
The scene where Gwindor of Nargothrond escaped from Angband and was found by Beleg in the forest of Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion) with one of these lamps was painted by J.R.R. Tolkien and published in Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien (1979), no. 37.
