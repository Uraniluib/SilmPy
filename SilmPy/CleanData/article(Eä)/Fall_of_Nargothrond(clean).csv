The Fall of Nargothrond was the overthrow and destruction of the city by that name, wrought by Glaurung and his hordes, in .
==Prelude==
Since its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a secretive war against Morgoth, hunting their enemies by stealth and ambush rather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor, though, he counselled a different strategy to Orodreth, who had by that time succeeded his brother Finrod as King in Nargothrond. Orodreth therefore built a bridge from his doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth.
This was a foolhardy strategy. In centuries of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of Nargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new bridge removed the defense of the River Narog. Glaurung was sent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city.
==The Battle==
The army of Nargothrond went out to meet Glaurung on the field of Tumhalad, some miles north of the citadel. The Elves there were wiped out, and the folk of the city instead found the Dragons and his Orcs crossing their bridge and entering the citadel. These people, including Orodreths daughter Finduilas, were captured by the Orcs and driven northward. It is unknown if any soldiers remained as garrison within the city.
Coming late to the sack were Túrin and some few other survivors of the Battle of Tumhalad. At the sight of the Dragon, Túrins companions fled, but Túrin himself was placed under Glaurungs dragon-spell, and forced to watch as the captives were driven away. Then Glaurung released Túrin, knowing the evils this would cause, and settled to enjoy his newly-sacked domain.
