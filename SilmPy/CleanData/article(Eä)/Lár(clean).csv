lár means "a stop or pause" in Quenya., note 9
The word also referred to a Númenóreans linear measure roughly equivalent to, and translated in the text as, a league.  Whereas our "league" is 5280 yards (4828 metres), the lár is 5277 yards, 2 feet and 4 inches (4825 metres), or 5000 Ranga.  It was called "pause" because Númenórean military units on the march usually paused every 5000 rangar.
