Nahar was the legendary horse ridden by Oromë, the Huntsman of the Valar. Nahars coat was said to be white under the Sun, but to shimmer in silver in the night, and his feet were shod in gold.
==History==
In  Oromë was riding and hunting east near the Orocarni when Nahar gave a great neighing and stood still.  Wondering, Oromë too went still and heard afar the singing of many voices.  Thus Nahar alerted his master to the existence of the awakened Elves.  Later, in , when the hosts of the Eldalië left Cuiviénen, Oromë rode Nahar at their head.
After Melkor and Ungoliant had attacked the Two Trees in Valinor in  a terrible darkness fell upon the land.  Manwë perceived a Darkness beyond dark moving northward and Oromë began a pursuit.  The sparks struck from the hooves of Nahar were the first light that returned to Valinor.
==Etymology==
The Quenya name Nahar (probably Wikipedia:Onomatopoeia, from the neighing) was adapted from Valarin næχærra., p. 401
