Helcaraxë (pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin , "ice fangs", entry "Helcaraxe") was the perilous icy wastes that formerly lay between Araman (a region in the north of Aman) and Middle-earth in the far north of Arda. Here met the Ekkaia and the Belegaer, creating "vast fogs and mists of deathly cold, and the sea-streams were filled with clashing hills of ice and the grinding of ice deep-sunken."

At the beginning of the First Age, Morgoth and Ungoliant, escaping from the pursuit of the Valar, fled to Middle-earth across the treacherous wastes of the Helcaraxë. Later, Fingolfin and his people also made their way into Beleriand across the Helcaraxë.
Helcaraxë was also referred to as the Grinding Ice. Another name for this region was perhaps also the Narrow Ice, used by Bilbo Baggins in his poem Song of Eärendil.
==Etymology==
In the The Etymologies, the second element in Helkarakse is said to be the Quenya word karakse ("jagged hedge of spikes")., p. 362 (entry KARAK) Helge Fauskanger has suggested that the first element (hel-) derives from the Sundocarme KHELEK ("ice").Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 25 June 2011)
Also in the Etymologies, J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with Noldorin translations of Hekarakse: elcharaes, helcharaes or Helcharach., p. 19
