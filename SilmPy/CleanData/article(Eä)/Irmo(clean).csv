Irmo,  more commonly known as Lórien, was the Valar who was the master of visions and dreams and kept the Lórien (Valinor).
==History==
Irmo was the younger brother of Mandos. Irmo and Námo were the Fëanturi, the masters of spirits. Their sister was Nienna. Like his brother, Mandos, Irmo was typically known by the name of his domain, Lórien. 
In his gardens, he dwelt with his spouse Estë. His halls and extensive gardens were located away from Valmar though still within Valinor. Irmo tended to the Elves of Valinor in Lórien and provided a peaceful refuge. He would guide the Eldar with visions and dreams.
When Míriel became life weary after giving birth to Fëanor, she was brought to Lórien for rest and solace. But her spirit willingly departed to Mandos, and she refused to return.
When the Sun and Moon were originally set in their paths, Varda purposed that the two vessels should journey in Ilmen and mingle their light as the Two Trees once had. However, Irmo and Estë asked her to reconsider as "sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth." Therefore, Varda changed her council and allowed for a time of night where the world would still have shadows and half-light.
==Etymology==
Irmo (pronounced ) is a Quenya name meaning "Desirer" or "Master of Desire"., p. 85 His common name Lórien (Quenya; ) means "Land of Dreams".
In early versions of the legendarium, this Vala (variously spelt Lorien and Lôrien) was given many different surnames: Qenya Olofantur (the element fantur, a derivative of the Sundocarme FANA, refers to "visions, dreams, falling asleep"), pp. 253, 259, Qenya Fulmur (probably from the root FUMU, "sleep"), and Gnomish Losfan (consisting of oloth "a dream, apparition, vision" + ending -fan, thus (o)loth-fan > Losfan)., p. 12 Gnomish renderings of his first name included Glurim (containing the element lûr "slumber") and Lûriel or Lúriel (> Lúrin)., p. 18
In Eriols Old English translations, Irmo is referred to as Swefnfréa "Dream-ruler".

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Poppies, the flowers of sleep "which the Gods called fumellar," were used in enchantments by Irmo. And in the silvery light of the cauldron Silindrin, which held the collected dew of Telperion, he descried many mysterious visions.
