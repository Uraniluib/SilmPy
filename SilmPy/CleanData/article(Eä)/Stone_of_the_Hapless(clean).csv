The Stone of the Hapless was the hallowed stone on the banks of the River Taeglin that commemorated Túrin and Nienor, and Morwen their mother.
==Fate==
Later, during the drowning of Beleriand, the site of the Stone of the Hapless did not drown (as predicted by Glirhuin), but remained as an island, Tol Morwen.
==Etymology==
The stone had two other names: the Standing Stone, and Talbor., "The Wanderings of Húrin" (see especially Notes 15 and 55) Talbor is Taliska and the latter part of the word, bor (Taliska), means stone.
