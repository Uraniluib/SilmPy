}}
The Authorities are a group mentioned fleetingly in The Lord of the Rings Prologue, regarding the Riddle-game between Bilbo Baggins and Gollum.
Considering that the rules of the Game were sacred, its possible that the Authorities was another name for the Valar.
; note that the reference is wrong, as the Authorities arent mentioned in Riddles in the Dark., entry "Authorities", according to information from Dick Plotz.
