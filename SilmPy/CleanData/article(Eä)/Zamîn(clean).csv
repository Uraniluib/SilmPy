Zamîn, called "mother Zamîn" by the boy Îbal, was a servant in the White House of Erendis.  As such she was a companion of Erendis daughter, Tar-Ancalimë, who first learned of her fathers name (Aldarion) from the old country woman.
When Ancalimë had grown to adulthood and become the heir of the king (upon Tar-Aldarions reformulation of the Law of Succession in Númenor) she was beset by suitors coming to Emerië.  Zamîn aided the Tar-Ancalimë, or "Princess Shepherdess" to go into hiding on a farm bordering the lands of Hallatan of Hyarastorni.
==Etymology==
Zamîns name appears to be Adûnaic, but its meaning is impossible to determine.
