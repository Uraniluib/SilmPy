A house that stood in the Emerië region of the Mittalmar of Númenor. It was built for Erendis as a gift by Tar-Meneldur, to mark her betrothal to his son Tar-Aldarion. Aldarion spent many years away from Númenor in his ships, and the White House became a sanctuary for his wife Erendis, and their daughter, who would become Queen Tar-Ancalimë.
