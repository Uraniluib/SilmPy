Amon Dîn, sometimes just Dîn, was the easternmost of the Warning beacons of Gondor of Gondor and nearest to Minas Tirith, lying to the east of the Drúadan Forest., p. 510
Amon Dîn was perhaps the oldest of the beacon hills, originally used as a fortified outpost of Minas Tirith. It kept watch over the passage into North Ithilien from Dagorlad and any attempt by enemies to cross the Anduin near Cair Andros.
In the late Third Age, the eastward side of Amon Dîn was covered with wide grey thickets.  On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
==Etymology==
Amon Dîn is Sindarin, meaning "silent hill" (amon + dîn)., p. 19 Probably it refers to its distinct rocky and barren appearance standing out and isolated from the heavily wooded hills of the Drúadan Forest.
