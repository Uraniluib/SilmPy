The Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul was a skirmish between the Fellowship of the Ring and the Orcs of the Misty Mountains which took place on 15 January . It was a significant event in the Quest of the Ring, resulting in the separation of Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship.
== History ==
=== Prelude ===
After being turned back by a snowstorm at the Redhorn Pass and unwilling to risk the Gap of Rohan for fear of capture by Isengard, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty Mountains through the abandoned Dwarves city of Moria. Gimli hoped to encounter, or at least discover the fate of, Balin expedition to re-establish Moria with which the Dwarves had lost contact. At the end of their third day in Moria the Fellowship took refuge in the Chamber of Mazarbul—the site of Balins Tomb—and learnt of his failure from the Book of Mazarbul. Immediately afterwards they heard the sounds of drums and horn blasts. Gandalf was able to ascertain that a band of Orcs, including several black Uruk-hai of Mordor, and at least one Cave-trolls were approaching one of the chambers two doors.
=== Battle ===
The Fellowship intended to make an escape through the east door, which was to their knowledge clear of enemies; however, since the other door opened inwards and could not be locked or barred they were forced to hold their ground until they could put off pursuit. Boromir attempted to wedge the door with broken swords before the orcs arrived; however, a large cave-troll was able to break through with its foot. Frodo Baggins managed to force the troll to withdraw temporarily by stabbing its foot with Sting, but the orcs were able to breach what remained of the doors and flooded in.
In the ensuing melee Gimli and Samwise Gamgee are recorded as killing one orc each, Legolas two with his bow, while Aragorn and Boromir are said to have slain "many". The orcs then retreated and Gandalf judged the time right to make an escape. However before the Fellowship could reach the door, a "huge orc chieftain" forced past Aragorn and Boromir and pinned Frodo to the wall with a spear. To the astonishment of his companions Frodos mithril shirt saved him from injury and his attacker was quickly beheaded by Aragorn, finally routing the orcs.
Gandalf stayed behind to hold the door while the rest of the Fellowship fled down a dark and narrow stairway. As they reached its foot they saw a bright white light from the doorway and Gandalf swiftly descended the stairs to join them; he told them he had "met Durins Bane, and nearly been destroyed" and then urged the company forward.
=== Aftermath ===
After a brief rest where Gandalf discusses his encounter with what the Fellowship will later discover to be a Balrogs they continued their retreat towards the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, along the way being occasionally fired upon by orc archers. Upon reaching the bridge the Fellowship turn to see the balrog closing in on them and realise its nature. Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf are all described as becoming physically distraught at the realisation. Nevertheless Gandalf regained his composure and ordered the rest of the Fellowship to cross the bridge while he held the rear.
In order to secure the Fellowships retreat Gandalf broke the bridge with his staff, sending the balrog falling into the chasm beneath. He too falls, however, as the balrogs whip catches his legs. The remaining members of the Fellowship assumed he perished in the fall and upon escaping Moria appointed Aragorn their new leader. In actuality both Gandalf and the Balrog survived the fall and continued their duel amongst the many caverns and tunnels underneath the mountain, eventually culminating in the Battle of the Peak.
== Portrayal in adaptations ==
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:The battle begins when a large group of orcs break through the Chamber door. The cave-troll enters early on, breaking into the Chamber and nearly killing Samwise Gamgee. The fighting continues, with Legolas, Aragorn, Boromir and Gimli killing many orcs. At one point during the fight, Legolas climbs up onto the Cave-trolls shoulders and shoots its head with an arrow, but to no avail. While swinging madly around the chamber, the Cave-troll smashes Balins Tomb. Despite Aragorns attempt to protect the hobbit, the Cave-troll (rather than an orc-chieftain) hits Frodo with a spear.
:Following the victory, when most of the orcs have been killed or fled the Chamber, the Fellowship hears the sound of more orcs approaching and flees through a break in the eastern wall of the chamber, running back through the Twenty-first Hall. The action is extended further in the film, as the Fellowship are soon surrounded by hundreds of Moria orcs, before the Balrog enters the hall.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:The beginning of the battle is shown in a cutscene, but is abruptly skipped just as the Orcs are seen swarming into the chamber.
