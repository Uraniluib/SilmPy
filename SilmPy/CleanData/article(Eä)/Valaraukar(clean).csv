Valarauco pl. Valaraucar p.415 p.10 is the Quenya name for the Maiarin followers of Morgoth better known in their Sindarin form: Balrogs.
==Etymology==
It is formed from words Valar, power and rauco, monster.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In The Etymologies, the word Balrog is derived from ñgwalaraukô, RUK displaying a derivation from root ñgwal- (referring to "torment, cruelty") instead of val-. This derivation would produce the Quenya word **Nwalarauco.
In The Book of Lost Tales, the Qenya term is Malcarauce.
==Note==
Valarauco is not forming a regular plural  Asterisk#FandomValaraucor but changing the final vowel in the plural (-o > -ar). Helge Fauskanger suggests that the singular form uses the variant rauco, while the plural form uses the variant rauca for some reason.
Another Quenya word which displays similar properties is perhaps sundo.
