The Undertowers was a dwelling of Hobbits in the Westmarch during the Fourth Age. It was located near the White Towers.
It was at Undertowers that Samwise Gamgees daughter Elanor Gardner settled with Fastred of Greenholm to found the Fairbairn Family, the hereditary Warden of Westmarch.,  In time, the Fairbairns would become as influential as the Took Family and Brandybuck Familys in the history of the Shire, and it was at Undertowers that they preserved the Red Book of Westmarch, whose contents formed the ultimate basis for chronicles of the War of the Ring and the Elder Days.
