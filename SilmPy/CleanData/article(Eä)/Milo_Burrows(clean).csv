Milo Burrows was a hobbit of the Shire. 
==History==
Milo was a grandson of Gorbadoc Brandybuck of Buckland, who married into the Baggins Family when he wedded Peony Baggins, a distant cousin of both Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. They had four children - Mosco Burrows, Moro Burrows, Myrtle Burrows and Minto Burrows - and all of the family was present at Bilbos famous Bilbos Farewell Party. 
Milo was known for his habit of failing to reply to letters, and because of this he was one of those that found a specially selected gift waiting for him in Bag End, after Bilbos departure: a golden inkpot and pen.
