Wraiths was a name for people having been transformed into undead beings. The realm of the wraiths was called the Unseen.
==History==
In the Elder Days, the wraith of Gorlim appeared in a dream of Beren.
In the Second Age, the Men of the White Mountains broke their oath to Isildur. This crime combined by Isildurs curse turned the Oathbreakers into shades who haunted the mountains until the Third Age. Aragorn II, in the capacity of the Heir of Isildur, released the Oathbreakers from their curse in return for their aid at Pelargir.
In the Third Age, it was rumoured that the wraith of Helm haunted the enemies of Rohan, killing those who felt fear.
The most famous of the wraiths were the Nazgûl, Men ensnared by Saurons Nine Rings.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, passim Some of the victims of the Ringwraiths, too, could be transformed into wraiths, albeit lesser and under their command (although there are no records of such a being). This nearly happened to Frodo Baggins, after having been stabbed by the Morgul-knife of the Witch-king.
