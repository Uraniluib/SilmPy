Standing Silence was a custom of the Gondorians to stand in a moment of silence, facing west, before meals.  As Faramir told Frodo Baggins in Henneth Annûn, "We look toward Númenor that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be."
==Tolkien Society tradition==
The Tolkien Society has a tradition of reciting the Standing Silence at events. Before a meal, attendees face west and the Chairman recites the Standing Silence as told by Faramir.
