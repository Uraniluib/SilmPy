Fang was one of the guard Dogs of Farmer Maggots Bamfurlong. Fang was one of the three large, wolf-like dogs, (the other two were named Grip and Wolf (dog)). 
These ferocious but well-trained animals lived at his farm at the time of the War of the Ring, but he had evidently kept other dogs before these. Frodo Baggins had frightening memories of Maggots dogs going back some thirty years, but the dogs that had threatened him three decades earlier could hardly have been Fang, Grip or Wolf.
==Etymology==
Fang means "canine tooth" but was also an archaic English verb meaning "grip"., p. 757
