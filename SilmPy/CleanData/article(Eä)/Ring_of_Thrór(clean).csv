The Ring of Thrór was the first of the Seven Rings to be forged, and the last to be recovered by Sauron. 
While Sauron himself gave the Dwarves their Rings of Power, this one was originally given to King Durin III of Moria by Celebrimbor, and it remained in his line for thousands of years until it was inherited by Thrór, the King under the Mountain. 
It was during Thrórs reign that Smaug descended on the Lonely Mountain and drove the Dwarves into exile. Long after his kingdoms destruction, Thrór passed the ring to his son Thráin, who dwelt for many years as an exile from his ancient home.
At last, Thráin set out on an ill-fated quest to regain his kingdom, but he was captured by the spies of Sauron, and the Ring of Thrór was lost forever.
Many Dwarves however did not know the fate of the Ring, and thought that it was lost in Moria when Thrór was killed by Azog. It was thought that one of the reasons Balin wished to Balins Colony was to find the Ring. In the Council of Elrond, Gandalf told Glóin that Balin would not find the Ring there, as it was given to Thráin and lost in Dol Guldur.
