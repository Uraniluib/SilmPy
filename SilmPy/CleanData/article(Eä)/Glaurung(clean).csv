On the other hand, the only two named winged-dragons (Ancalagon and Smaug) were also urulóki: they breathed fire. There are no other dragons explicitly stated to be like Glaurung, both fire-breathing but not flying, making it difficult to argue from Tolkiens published works that he intended Glaurungs brood to constitute a discrete lineage. In the end all that can be gleaned of how Tolkien conceived of the taxonomy of dragons comes from isolated references to different types like urulóki, cold-drake and long-worms, so the problem likely does not have a (canon) answer.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Throughout early versions of the legendarium, Glaurung was known by different names: Glórund (the c. 1916-1919 The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)) > Glórung (the 1926 Sketch of the Mythology) > Glómund (the 1930 Quenta Noldorinwa; the Lay of Leithian) > Glaurung (the c. 1951 The Grey Annals; the published The Silmarillion). (Section 13), Chapter XII "Conversations with Smaug": (i) Tolkiens Dragons
An epithet used for the dragon was Foalókë (Qenya; foa + lókë), said to be the "name of a serpent that guarded a treasure". The Gnomish form of the epithet was Fuithlug ("a dragon (who guards treasure)")., p. 340, p. 363
==Portrayal in adaptations==
1988, 1994: Middle-earth Role Playing:
:Glaurung was described and given role-playing statistics in the  supplements Creatures of Middle-earth and Creatures of Middle-earth (2nd edition). His name was given the Quenya translation "Golden Gloom"., p. 111 Furthermore, Glaurung was conceived to have bred the cold-drakes Scatha and Ando-anca (whose names were suggested to be revised to Skadi and Skell).Chris Seeman (1998), "Dragons of the North", in Other Hands Other Hands 23
