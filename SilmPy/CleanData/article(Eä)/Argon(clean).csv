__NOTOC__


== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
Argon does not appear in the published The Silmarillion at all, as he only came to light in very late writings by J.R.R. Tolkien.  His character was developed as Tolkien devised the genealogies.  At first he fell in the fighting at Alqualondë and then he perished while crossing the Helkaraxë before his death was set in the Battle of the Lammoth.
