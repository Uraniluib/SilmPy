Avathar or Avaþar (Vanyarin Quenya, pron. ) was the land in the south-eastern part of Aman, south of Valinor. It formed a dark strip of land at the feet of the Pelóri Mountains. It seems to have been totally deserted and forgotten and in ancient times Ungoliant made her home there.
==Etymology==
In "The Later Quenta Silmarillion" section of Morgoths Ring, J.R.R. Tolkien translates Avathar as "The Shadows" in "ancient" Quenya;, p. 284 this translation also appears in The Silmarillion., Avathar
However, in the "Quendi and Eldar", Tolkien states that Avathar has no Elvish translation, meaning that it must have been adapted from its Valarin name, p. 404 (however, in the Index to that book it still says "The Shadows" in a short description).
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of The Silmarillion, the region where Ungoliant dwelt prior to the Darkening of Valinor was called Arvalin.
