==History==
He was one of the many leaders of Men who brought companies to Minas Tirith; in his contingent were three hundred gallant green-clad men.  A week later, he fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, rushing to the aid of Éomer and the Rohirrim, in the van with Imrahil of Dol Amroth, Húrin (Warden of the Keys) and Forlong.  He was slain on the fields before the City.
==Etymology==
The name Hirluin is composed of the two elements hîr "lord" and luin "pale, fair" (and by extension "blue")., p. 197
