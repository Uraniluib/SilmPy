zigil is a word in Khuzdul, occuring as an element in Zirakzigil, the Dwarves name for the mountain called Celebdil or Silvertine by other races, and in Zigil-nâd, a rejected Dwarvish name for Kibil-nâla, the river known to the Elves as Celebrant and to Men as the Silverlode.
Zigil therefore evidently means ‘silver’.
