Stoorish was the dialect of Westron spoken by the Stoors.
Because of their relative isolation and different route during their Wandering Days, the Stoors borrowed peculiar linguistic manners from the Vales of Anduin or the Angle of Eriador.
Stoorish characteristics with its Dunlendish background was retained in the Shire. Several regional peculiarities could be seen in regions that Stoors mostly settled in (eg. Buckland and the Marish). Bucklanders such as the Brandybucks wore peculiar names apparently derived from the former southern Stoorish.
==Inspiration==
Tolkien said to the Dutch Translator, Max Schuchart, that there were "Celtic elements in Buckland and Eastfarthing names.", p. 93
The Stoors have Celtic elements in their names reflecting their Pre-Númenórean background (via the Dunlendings)Jim Allan, An Introduction to Elvish "Giving of Names". Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the Bree-landers resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.

2001: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Meriadoc Brandybuck is described as being the linguistic "oddball" of the group: his accent is noticeably distinct from the other Hobbits seen on-screen, something of an invention between actor Dominic Monaghan and the dialect coaches, to reflect his unique origin.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online
:In keeping with Tolkiens usage of Celtic for non-Westron elements, the Stoor characters in Dunland are often seen with Welsh names.http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?375331-Stoorish-names Stoorish names
