Hildórien (Quenya: "Land of the Men", pron. Noldorin ) was the land in the far eastIn a very early map of symmetrical Arda, there is a region marked "Hildorien" at the very eastern shores of the land-mass that would become Middle-earth. Cf.  of Middle-earth in which the first Men or Hildor, awoke at the beginning of the First Age.
It was said among the Elves, that Morgoth went there and put a darkness in the hearts of the Men. Some Men, who were at war with those who fell under the Shadow, fled Hildórien seeking the Light of Valinor of the Aman.
==Etymology==
The Silmarillion appendix confirms that Hildórien is of the same root as the word Hildor. It can be therefore understood as Quenya Hildor + -ien, therefore "Land of the Followers".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales, Men awoke in a hidden valley called Murmenalda, the Vale of Sleep or Slumbrous Dale. It was enclosed by a wall of encircling mountains, east of Palisor, described as "hallowed" and full of sweet fragrances and odours, and songs of nightingales, its beauty being comparable to Valinor. It was full of sleeping figures.
It was discovered by the Dark Elves Nuin after finding a passage through the mountain wall. Nuin almost swooned at its loveliness and was puzzled by the Sleepers. Despite Tuvons warnings, Nuin visited it often to watch the Sleepers until, overcome with curiosity, he woke the first pair of them.
Murmenalda is Qenya, composed of murme "sleep" (root MURU) and nalda (root NLDL).
