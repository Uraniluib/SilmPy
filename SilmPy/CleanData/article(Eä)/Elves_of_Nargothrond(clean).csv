The Elves of Nargothrond were those who followed Finrod and dwelt under his rule in the underground citadel of Nargothrond on the banks of the River Narog.
==History==
For the most part of the First Age, the Elves of Nargothrond remained hidden and isolated, waging a guerilla war against the forces of Morgoth, ambushing but never assaulting them directly in open warfare. Spies and scouts of Nargothrond guarded Talath Dirnen, the plains between Nargothrond and Doriath., p. 110
The realm of Nargothrond extended westward to the Sea and the Elves were allied to the Falathrim. With their help they built ships and some of them explored the Isle of Balar, thinking to prepare it as a last refuge in time of need.

However they also participated in major events of the Age, as during Dagor Bragollach, when Finrod and his army came north to stop the onslaught. In that skirmish, they were ambushed at the Fen of Serech but a sortie by Barahir rescued them, and allowed them to retreat. Finrod pledged to Barahir for saving him.
In order to repay this pledge, Finrod and a company of ten Elves of Nargothrond participated also in the Quest for the Silmaril to assist Beren, Leaving Orodreth to rule in his place. These Elves were captured by Sauron in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and were devoured one by one, including Finrod.
A small army from Nargothrond also joined the Union of Maedhros in order to avenge losses of the previous battle, but Gwindors premature assault led to the disastrous Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

After that battle, most of Beleriand was under the power of Angband and there was a massive orc-buildup nearby. Túrin Turambar came to Nargothrond and gained influence among the Elves. Against the counsels of Ulmo, he persuaded the forces of Nargothrond to turn into open war against the Orcs. This led to the disastrous Battle of Tumhalad which all but exterminated the army of Nargothrond, and King Orodreth was killed. Glaurung the Worm led Orcs to the Sack of Nargothrond where all women were taken prisoners, and taken by the Crossings of Teiglin; the Haladin of Brethil came to their rescue in vain; the Orcs managed to kill all their captives.
The fate of any survivors or their descendants is unknown; Nargothrond diappears from history as it remained deserted until the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, but some members of the House of Finrod lingered in Middle-earth until the Third Age.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
