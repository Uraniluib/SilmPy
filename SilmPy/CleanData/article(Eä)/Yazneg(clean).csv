Yazneg was an Orcs who was Azogs initial lieutenant during his pursuit of Thorin and Company in the The Hobbit (film series). He was played by John Rawls. His appearance was derived from early concept designs for Azog.
==History==
After spotting the Company of Dwarves camping out, Yazneg sent Fimbul to tell Azog that they found Thorin and his Company. They catch up with Thorin near Rivendell, but are distracted by Radagast and his rabbit sled. However, during the chase, an orc spotted where Thorin and his Company were hiding. The orcs then encircle the dwarves and attempt to attack them, but were forced to retreat due to an attack by Elrond and his Elves forces. Yazneg and Fimbul returned to Weathertop, where Azog ultimately threw Yazneg to the packs Wargs to feast upon, with Fimbul becoming his new lieutenant.
==Etymology==
Yazneg is not a name created by Tolkien and its derivation isnt explained within the films. However David Salo, who worked as a linguistic consultant for The Hobbit (film series), provides an Orkish wordlist on his blog which glosses yaz as "name" and -neg as "without".
