The Tower of Avallónë was raised to overlook the haven of Avallónë on the island of Tol Eressëa. There the Master-stone was kept.  It is said that when a mariner sailed to Aman he saw the tower first of all on the horizon.The Silmarillion, Akallabêth.  "...the tower of Avallónë is the first sight that the mariner beholds when at last he draws nigh to the Undying Lands over the leagues of the Sea." Ballantine Books p. 310.
The Elostirion-stone, one of the palantíri erected in the tallest of the towers of Emyn Beraid, could show the tower when used by King Elendil.  This would comfort him when he longed for the West.The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age.  "To Elostirion Elendil would repair, and thence he would gaze out over the sundering seas, when the yearning of exile was upon him; and it is believed that thus he would at whiles see far away even the Tower of Avallónë upon Eressëa, where the Masterstone abode, and yet abides." Ballantine p. 350.
