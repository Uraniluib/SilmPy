==Etymology==
Christopher Tolkien has suggested that I Vene Kemen is a Qenya name perhaps meaning "The Shape of the Earth" or "The Vessel of the Earth". The element vene is likely related to the root VENE "shape, cut out, scoop" and its derivative venë ("small boat, vessel, dish"). For the element kemen, the Qenya Lexicon contains the words kemi ("earth, soil") and kemen ("soil"), derived from the root KEME., pp. 254, 257 (entries Glorvent amd Kémi)
