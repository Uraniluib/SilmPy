Methed-en-glad was a stronghold that was established at the edge of the forest south of the Crossings of Taeglin during the brief existence of Dor-Cúarthol, when Túrin and Beleg lived on Amon Rûdh.  It was kept by previously leaderless Men and Elves who had been dispossessed through battle and defeat.  From the stronghold there was a view to the south to Amon Rûdh, to and from which signals could pass for tidings and commands., pp. 144-145
