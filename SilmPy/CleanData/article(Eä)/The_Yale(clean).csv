The Lowlands of the Yale or just The Yale was a region of the Eastfarthing of the Shire between the Bridgefields and the Marish. The road from Tuckborough emerged from the Woody End and descended into the Yale, on its way to join the Causeway at Stock.
The Yale was of old the home of the Boffin Family.
==Etymology==
David Salo has suggested that Yale represents an Old English form *Geal, from Welsh Wikipedia:Iâl. This fits right in with Tolkiens comment to the Dutch Translator, Max Schuchart, that there were "Celtic elements in Buckland and Eastfarthing names.", p. 93
Yale is of course a well known English surname derived from a Welsh place name.Mark T. Hooker, A Tolkienian Mathomium, pp. 42-47  The modern meaning is "fertile upland", based on the location of the best known Yale, the wikipedia:commote of Wikipedia:Iâl in Powys, the traditional home of the kings of Powys.
