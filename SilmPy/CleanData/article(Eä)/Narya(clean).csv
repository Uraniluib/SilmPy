Narya (pron. ), the Ring of Fire or Red Ring, was one of the Rings of Power, specifically one of the "Three Rings for the Elven Kings under the sky".
==History==
Created by Celebrimbor after Annatar had left Eregion, it was free of Annatars (Saurons) influence due to the fact that the Elves hid their three rings from him upon discerning his intent, but it was still bound to the One Ring. According to Unfinished Tales, at the start of the War of the Elves and Sauron Celebrimbor gave Narya together with the Ring Vilya to Gil-galad, High King of the Noldor. Gil-galad entrusted Narya to his lieutenant Círdan, Lord of the Havens of Grey Havens, who kept it after Gil-galads death. In The Lord of the Rings, Gil-galad receives only Vilya, while Círdan receives Narya from the very beginning. In the Third Age Círdan gave the ring to Gandalf for his labours. It is described as having the power to inspire others to resist tyranny, as well as (in common with the other Three Rings) hiding the wielder from remote observation (except by the wielder of the One) and giving resistance to the weariness of time:

==Etymology==
The name Narya is Quenya, deriving from the elements narwa "fiery red", entry "NAR1"  + -ya (adjective suffix).
