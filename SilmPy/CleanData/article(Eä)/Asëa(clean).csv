==Etymology==
The meaning and etymology of asëa is a matter of debate. In 1998, William Cloud Hicklin claimed to have "ongoing discussion about the origins of the word athelas" with Christopher Tolkien, and wrote in a forum message that:
"a very late note by Tolkien (1970 or later) says that Asea ... was the name in Quenya, regularly adapted and compounded with -las in Sindarin.  The plant was known to the medical loremasters of the Noldor. The root is *ATHAYA, helpful, kindly, beneficial."http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books.tolkien/msg/3fad9c3c879f5a2c Athelas (message from William Cloud Hicklin, dated 26 October 1998) at http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.books.tolkien Rec.arts.books.tolkien (accessed 13 May 2011)
Hicklins assertion has attracted a widespread attention on the Internet,http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?p=2854688 Annotated LotR Project: Flight to the Ford at http://forums.theonering.com Forums.theonering.com (accessed 14 May 2011)http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/32497 Message 32497 (dated 4 October 2005) at Elfling (accessed 14 May 2011)http://www.tuckborough.net/plants.html Plants & Trees (cf. Athelas) at http://www.tuckborough.net/index.htm The Thains Book (accessed 14 May 2011) and was reprinted in the journal Tyalië Tyelelliéva Tyalië Tyelelliéva 15 (p. 31).Lisa Star, "http://www.reocities.com/tyalie/unpub.html A List of Tolkiens Unpublished and Slightly Published Manuscripts" (dated August 2002) at http://www.reocities.com/ Reocities.com (accessed 14 May 2011) Hicklins suggested etymology has also been picked up by Helge Fauskanger in his "Quenya-to-English wordlist", where asëa is said to be an adjective meaning "beneficial, helpful, kindly" derived from root ATHAYA.http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 14 May 2011)http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/wordlists.htm Quenya Wordlists at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 14 May 2011)This is given by Helge Fauskanger as the first meaning of asëa. The second meaning is given as "2) asëa (þ) noun, name of the healing plant called in Sindarin athelas", referring to , p. 148.
Another mention of the existence of an unpublished etymology of athelas/asëa occurred in The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion (2005/2008), where the authors referred to a claim by Arden R. Smith. Here it was written that the first element in athelas is connected with Quenya asëa., p. 183 
With the publication of J.R.R. Tolkiens manuscript "Words, Phrases & Passages in The Lord of the Rings" in 2007, an etymology of athelas/asëa was published, and editor Christopher Gilson wrote in a comment that this etymology is the source of the claim in The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion. 
Since Tolkiens manuscript date from the late 1950s and early 1960s (and does not include any mention of the root ATHAYA), Hicklins claim of an unpublished etymology dating from the 1970s remains unverified in published sources.
In his analysis of the Quenya words in "Words, Phrases & Passages in The Lord of the Rings", Petri Tikka has tentatively suggested that asëa could mean "foil" (gloss followed by a question mark).Petri Tikka, "http://www.petritikka.com/elvish/PE17.html Quenya words in Parma Eldalambaron 17" at http://www.petritikka.com/elvish/ Men Eldalambínen: A Place in Elvish (accessed 14 May 2011)Tikkas reasoning apparently stems from a literal translation of asëa aranion as "athelas". Tolkiens translation of asëa aranion as "asëa of the Kings" is given in , p. 100, and the note which says "athelas kingsfoil appears on p. 49.
