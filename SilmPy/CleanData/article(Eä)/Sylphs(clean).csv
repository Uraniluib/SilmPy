Sylphs were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in the earliest versions of the tales of Arda and nomenclature by the Eldar., p. 66, pp. 301, 306 (§4077-9)
==Characteristics and divisions==
The sylphs were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser Ainur spirits: sylphs (spirits of the air), sprites (spirits of the earth), and mermaids.
Manwë had "two clans of air-spirits", a basic division of two groups of sylphs which, with their Elvish names, are given as follow:
*Qenya Mánir (or Mānir, p. 31): "spirits of the air"; Gnomish môna or môni, pp. 57, 68
*Qenya Súruli/Sūruli, also Suluthrim) (sing. Sūru): "spirits of the winds"; Gnomish Sulus (pl. Sulussin)
An individual Súru mentioned by name was Ilinsor, steersman of the Moon. Ilinsor "loved the snows and the starlight and aided Varda in many of her works"., pp. 192-5
==Commentary==
It has been suggested that the concept "air spirits" is used "metaphorically ... for the winds that these spirits govern"., p. 59
==The later legendarium==
Sylphs are not mentioned in the later versions of the legendarium. Many of the classes of beings references in The Book of Lost Tales were superseded by the concept of the Maiar, which were not introduced until the reworking of the Annals of Valinor into the Annals of Aman.
==Inspiration==
Patrick H. Wynne and Christopher Gilson have noted that Tolkiens use of sylphs (and related spirits) is likely influenced by Wikipedia:Paracelsuss chart of four elementals: sylphs (air), pygmies or gnomes (earth), nymphs (water), and salamanders (fire)., p. 8
