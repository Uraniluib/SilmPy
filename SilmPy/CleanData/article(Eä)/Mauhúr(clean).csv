Mauhúr was an Orcs in the service of Saruman.
==History==
Mauhúr was sent to reinforce Uglúks troop as they returned to Isengard with Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. He found them surrounded by Éomers Rohirrim at the edge of Fangorn Forest, from which he led his Orcs in an attack. This attack was a failure: the Rohirrim were able to defeat the Orcs, even with Mauhúrs reinforcements. Though Mauhúrs own fate is not known with certainty, it seems that he fell with his soldiers at the hands of the Rohirrim.
