__NOTOC__
Harnen was a river south of Gondor.
 
==Course==
A good 600 Númenóreans miles long, it began in the Ephel Dúath of Mordor and then flowed south-west for about 350 miles, when it bent west and sped to Belegaer, which it entered in a wide delta by the Bay of Belfalas.  South of the Harnen lay the land of Near Harad.
==History==
In the year  Ciryaher crossed the Harnen with his army and defeated the Men of the Harad.  After that date the river formed the southern border of the contested land of South Gondor, South Gondor, and as such formed the southern border of Dúnedain influence.  Much of this influence was lost after the wars of the Kin-strife; the descendants of Castamir established themselves in Umbar and Harondor became a debatable land.
The Greenway into Harad crossed the Harnen shortly after it bent westwards. This road was used by Saurons followers later in the Third Age.
==Etymology==
Harnen seems to mean "South Water" in Sindarin., p. 189, entry "Harnen"
