Apes were animals living far South of Middle-earth. 
Said to live in the dark forests of the South,, "Helms Deep (chapter)" they seem to have only been known in stories in the North. Probably due to their lesser intelligence, the word "ape", along with "maggot" and snaga, became an insult used by Orcs., "The Uruk-hai"
