Berens Song was Berens song of farewell to Lúthien.  It was sung by him in the Lay of Leithian as he left her for Angband, even as he looked across Anfauglith.  It is arguably among the best parts of the Lay.
:There still sat Beren, and he sang,
:and loud his lonely singing rang.
:Though Orcs should hear, or Wolves a-prowl,
:or any of the creatures foul
:within a shade that slunk and stared
:of Taur-na-Fuin, nought he cared,
:who now took leave of light and day,
:grim-hearted, bitter, fierce and fey.

:Farewell now here, ye leaves of trees,
:your music in the morning breeze!
:Farewell now blade and bloom and grass
:that see the changing seasons pass;
:ye waters murmuring over stone,
:and meres that silent stand alone!
:Farewell now mountain, vale, and plain!
:Farewell now wind and frost and rain,
:and mist and cloud, and heavens air;
:ye star and moon so blinding-fair
:that still shall look down from the sky
:on the wide earth, though Beren die—
:though Beren die not, and yet deep,
:deep, whence comes of those that weep
:no dreadful echo, lie and choke
:in everlasting dark and smoke.
:Farewell sweet earth and northern sky,
:for ever blest, since here did lie,
:and here with lissom limbs did run,
:beneath the moon, beneath the sun,
:Lúthien Tinúviel
:more fair than mortal tongue can tell.
:Though all to ruin fell the world,
:and were dissolved and backward hurled
:unmade into the old abyss,
:yet were its making good, for this—
:the dawn, the dusk, the earth, the sea—
:that Lúthien on a time should be!
