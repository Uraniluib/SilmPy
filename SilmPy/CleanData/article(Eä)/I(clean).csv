__NOTOC__
i (plural in in Sindarin) is the Quenya and Sindarin article "the" and relative pronoun "who".
==Sindarin==
===Mutations===
In Sindarin, the singular form causes lenition to the following word. For example tâl "foot" > i dâl "the foot". p. 298
The plural form causes nasal mutation, and the final -n is assimilated. For example Perian "Halflings" > in+Periain > i-Pheriain "the Halflings".
(The affection is usually noted with a hyphen or a dot between article and word.)
===Related forms===
These Sindarin prepositions contain the suffixed article -in:
*nan (preposition) "to the"
*ben "according to the"
*nuin "under the"
*erin "on the"
*uin (preposition) "of the"
The above combined articles when before a word, cause a peculiar phenomenon of lenition different from the above.http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm#mixed
==As a relative pronoun==
In both Quenya and Sindarin, i is used for the relative pronoun "who" or a conjunction "that", introducing a secondary phrase. In Quenya it is usually the plural form of ya/ye but can also be used in the Singular.
For example:
*Perhael, i sennui "Panthael" estathar aen "Samwise Gamgee, who ought to be called Fullwise", Kings Letter
*Ilúvatar i or ilya mahalmar ea (verb) "the One, who is above all thrones"
In Quenya, it can also be declined as a noun:
*illon camnelyes "from whom you received it?", p. 21

* Dragon Flame 2.0
