The Baggins Family were a remarkable and rich Hobbits family from The Shire which included two Ring-bearers: Frodo Baggins and Bilbo Baggins.
==History==
The Baggins clan traced their origin to the first recorded Baggins, one Balbo Baggins, who was born in or near Hobbiton in .
The Baggins family lived all around in the Shire, mostly in or near the town of Hobbiton. They were seen as well to do and respectable, with many connections to other aristocratic Hobbit families, like the Brandybucks and the Tooks; other branches were the Sackville-Baggins Family and the Chubb-Baggins Family.
Although generally unexceptional, its members with Took Family blood were more adventurous. A notable example was Bilbo Baggins who set out on the quest for Lonely Mountain with Gandalf the Grey and thirteen Dwarves: when he returned he was seen as odd or queer, but also extremely rich. Bilbo adopted his "nephew" Frodo Baggins, who inherited the Smials of Bag End after Bilbo left. Frodo himself was involved in the quest which ended the War of the Ring.
Other Bagginses include the descendants of Posco Baggins, as well as Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, who had maternal Baggins blood.
