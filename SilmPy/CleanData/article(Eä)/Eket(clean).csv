The eket was a short stabbing sword wielded by the Númenóreans. It was described as "a short stabbing sword with a broad blade, pointed and two-edged, from a foot to one and a half feet long.", note 28
Isildur carried one on his way to Arnor. While escaping the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, he retained the eket after discarding the rest of his war gear to swim across Anduin .

The swords description is similar in many ways to the Wikipedia:Gladius carried by Roman legionnaires.
