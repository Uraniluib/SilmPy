__NOTOC__
The Old Mill was the water-mill of Hobbiton, owned and run by the Sandyman Family. The Old Mill was a corn mill powered by a large water wheel. It lay directly adjacent to the bridge across the Water and next to the Old Grange as well.
==History==
In  Bilbo Baggins ran by the Mill and a mile beyond to get to the Green Dragon to meet Thorin and Company. By  Sandyman had been the miller for some time and passed down his craft to his son, Ted Sandyman. Lotho Sackville-Baggins bought the mill, and many other buildings in Hobbiton, before he moved in to Bag End. When Saruman came to the Shire, the Mill was knocked down and replaced by a New Mill, operated by Ted Sandyman and several Ruffians. After Sharkey was driven out, this new brick building was demolished.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the original version of Thorins letter to Bilbo the rendezvous point for the beginning of the journey to the Lonely Mountain was the Great Mill., p. 89 This was only changed to the Green Dragon in the page proofs just before the story was published., note 2, p. 98
==Inspiration==
The Sarehole Mill and its millers formed the inspiration for the Old Mill.
