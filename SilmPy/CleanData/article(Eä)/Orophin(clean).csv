__NOTOC__
Orophin was a Silvan Elves of Lothlórien.
==History==
Orophin was the brother of Haldir and Rúmil (elf of Lórien). He was one of the Galadhrim who seldom left Lothlórien and spoke but a little of Westron.
He was one of three wardens of the northern border of Lothlórien met by the Fellowship of the Ring as they entered the Lothlórien on 15 January .
Some days later, when a band of a hundred Orcs were seen passing the Nimrodel, the three brothers went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood. Orophin ran back to warn the Galadhrim and prepare an ambush and fortify the wood.
==Etymology==
Robert Foster identified the name as either Sindarin or Silvan., p. 109 At another point it is described to be "suitable to Sindarin sounds and patterns" although it is "not clearly etymologizable as Sindarin"., p. 51
One possibility is that Orophin means "Mountain Peak", from orod and pind.Didier Willis, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/24600 Elfling Message 24600
