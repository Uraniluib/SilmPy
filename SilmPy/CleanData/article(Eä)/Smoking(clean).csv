Smoking was an activity or custom begun by the Hobbits (who referred to it as an art).  It consisted of inhaling the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb called Pipe-weed.  
The Bree-hobbits Bree claimed to be the first to have smoked the Pipe-weed, but the first who cultivated it was Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom of the Shire, around the year . Smoking had spread from the Hobbits to Dwarves, Rangers of the North, and Wizards.

J.R.R. Tolkien was an avid pipe smoker. He attributed his addiction to his childhood, when he watched Father Francis Xavier Morgan smoking his pipe in a specific location each time. 
People who had met Tolkien noticed that a pipe was almost always in his hand or mouth, often making difficult to understand his speech.J.R.R. Tolkien Talks about the Discovery of Middle-earth, the Origins of Elvish by Richard Plotz, in Seventeen In a The Man Who Understands Hobbits, Tolkien said: "Every morning I wake up thinking, Good, another 24 hours of smoking".Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, "The Man Who Understands Hobbits", The Daily Telegraph Magazine (22 March 1968)
