Elendil was the first King of Arnor and was succeeded by Isildur.  Elendil ruled over both realms as High King of the Dúnedain-in-exile Isildur succeeded as High King as well upon his fathers death.  Isildur committed Gondor to the rule of Meneldil the son of Anarion as sole King of Gondor, but Isildurs royalty in the South-realm remained, as his line was by right High King over both Arnor and Gondor, though after Isildurs death, the realms were split. Isildurs heirs ruled Arnor and Anárions heirs ruled Gondor.
Eärnur was taken in Minas Morgul and never seen again, and the Kingdom of Gondor was ruled by a succession of Stewards of Gondor until the restoration of the line of Kings with Elessar (Aragorn), the first king of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.
