Dor Daidelos, the Region of Everlasting Cold, was a great plateau of Iron Mountains, the north pole of Middle-earth where no creatures lived. Morgoths fortress of Utumno was built somewhere in the far north of Arda and the frigid temperatures of the northern regions were thought to originate from the evil of his realm. The cold winds and ice remained centuries after the Dark Lord was defeated. After the War of Wrath, the Northern Waste and  parts of Forodwaith and Forochel were remnants of Dor Daidelos.
