Fatty Lumpkin was a pony kept by Tom Bombadil.
==History==
Fatty Lumpkin was rarely ridden by Tom, and spent much of his time roaming free on the Barrow-downs. While Frodo Baggins and his friends stayed at Toms, Fatty became friends with their ponies, Sharp-ears, Bumpkin, Wise-nose, Swish-tail, and White-socks.
After their encounter with a Barrow-wights, the hobbitss ponies became so frightened that they ran off to find Fatty. Tom called them all back with the names he had given them and he rode along with the hobbits for a while on Fatty Lumpkin. 
After the hobbitss ponies escaped from Bree they ran out again in the Downs to find Fatty. They stayed with Tom for a while, until he had heard news of the events at Bree.
