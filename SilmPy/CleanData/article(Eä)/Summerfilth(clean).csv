Summerfilth was a non-existent month used jocularly among Shire-hobbits.
Proverbially, Summerfilth would begin on the day of Highday; there was no actual month in the Shire Calendar that ever started on a Friday (since after the reform of c. , each weekday always fell on the same date) and the Hobbits would say "on Friday the first of Summerfilth" to refer to something that would never happen. 
==Etymology==
The name Summerfilth is taken from the real month of Winterfilth (approximately equivalent to our October).
