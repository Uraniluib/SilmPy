==Life==
===Youth===
Rose Cotton was born in the year  by Shire Reckoning, the second child and first daughter of Tolman Cotton Senior and Lily Brown. The Cotton family lived in a farm on the South Lane, which was fairly close to Bywater.J.R.R. Tolkien, Wayne G. Hammond, Christina Scull (eds.),"Unfinished Index", published (in segments) in The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, page 612 Not much of her youth is known, except that she and her brothers - Tolman Cotton Junior, Wilcome Cotton II, Bowman Cotton and Carl Cotton - frequently swam in the Bywater Pool with the children of the Gamgee family, to which the Cottons were close.
===War of the Ring===
Rosie was still fond of Sam when both grew to adulthood, and when he announced hed be going with Frodo Baggins to Crickhollow, she did not like it. Even though everyone had given up hope of seeing Sam - or any of the other Travellers - back, she waited patiently. Since the Spring of , she had expected Sam to return. 
 
At the time, Ruffians rule over the Shire had lasted some three months, having started earlier that year. Old Tom Cotton had been itching to get his hands on them, but he refrained from doing so as he had his wife and Rosie to look after. Rosie was relieved to find Sam on the doorstep on 2 November. 
Rosie and her mother tended to Sam, Frodo and several others that night, as they prepared to Battle of Bywater. With shining eyes and a smile on her face she heard Frodo tell of Sams adventure and fame abroad. Sam and Frodo lived with the Cottons until Bagshot Row and Bag End were restored, the following Spring. Sam later joined Frodo in Bag End, but was torn in two - he wanted to stay loyal to Frodo, as well as marry Rosie. 
Frodo solved this problem by telling Sam that he and Rosie would both be welcome to live with him at Bag End after the wedding. Sam and Rosie married on 1 May, , and moved into Bag End. There, they lived happily, and begot Elanor Gardner, their first daughter, who was born on the 25 March.
===Fourth Age===
The Fourth Age started with one child, but many more would follow. Rose bore a record thirteen children, beating Adamanta Chubb, the wife of the Gerontius Took, by one. Frodo Gardner was born in , Rose Gardner in , Merry Gardner in , Pippin Gardner in , Goldilocks Gardner in ,  Hamfast Gardner in , Daisy Gardner in , Primrose Gardner in , Bilbo Gardner in , Ruby Gardner in , Robin Gardner in , and their last child, Tolman Gardner, in .
That year, , marked the only major undertaking of Mistress Rose. She and Sam travelled to Gondor, and stayed with Aragorn for well over a year. In the meantime, Roses brother Tolman Cotton Junior took over Sams tasks as Mayor of Michel Delving. After their return, Rose would continue to live by her husbands side, until her passing at the age of 98 at Mid-years Day of .
==Etymology==
The name Rose is a translation of an unknown Westron name. She is, like many female Hobbits, named after a flower, the Roses. The surname Cotton comes from a Westron Hlothran, which roughly translates as "Cottager".
In the Kings Letter, which was not included in The Return of the King as published, Aragorn translated the name Rose as Roses#Etymology in Sindarin. In his linguistical analysis of the Kings Letter, Carl F. Hostetter noted the resemblance to Meril-i-Turinqi, the queen of Tol Eressëa in the earliest stages of the The Book of Lost Tales Part One.Carl F. Hostetter, The "Kings Letter": An Historical and Comparative Analysis, in Vinyar Tengwar 31 (September 1993), pages 12-34 Hostetter could not connect it to any entry in The Etymologies, which mirrors Christopher Tolkiens observations on Meril-i-Turinqi, for which no root could be found in the Qenya LexiconJ.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Book of Lost Tales Part One, "Appendix: Names in the Lost Tales - Part 1" - however, a Gnomish translation was translated as "Queen of Flowers". As the Tur represents the "queen" part, Meril appears to be one of the oldest words for "Flower" in the legendarium.
