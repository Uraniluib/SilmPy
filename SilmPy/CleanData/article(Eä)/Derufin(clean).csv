2015: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Derufin and Duilin (son of Duinhir) were hunting enthusiasts. Bored waiting for battle, they sneaked across the river to Ithilien to hunt. They could be found in Bar Húrin. In The Strength of Sauron the player accompanied them as they attempted to hunt Oliphaunts. They encountered more than one mûmak and, finding them larger than expected, were quickly forced to flee. However the brothers noted the beasts eyes as vulnerable targets, and despite the failure they agreed to help the player search Osgiliath for Faramir in exchange for the assistance. The brothers accompanied the player into the city, and the group succeeded in damaging Grond (battering ram) before encountering Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul) and being forced to retreat.
