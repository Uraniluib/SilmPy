The Barrow-downs or Tyrn Gorthad were a series of low hills east of the Shire, behind the Old Forest, and southwest of the village of Bree. Many of the hills were crowned with megaliths and barrows, hence their name.
==History==
The Barrow-downs were first inhabited by Men related to the Edain in the First Age,, Barrow-downs together with the Hills of Evendim to the north. They fled east as Easterlings invaded Eriador and passed on to Beleriand, but after these had left or been killed in the War of Wrath the Edain returned to their old homes.
During the Second Age they were fairly numerous, and when they met with the Númenóreans the Barrow-downs were the first places where the Dúnedain émigrés from Númenor settled. When Elendil returned to Middle-earth, the Barrow-downs were incorporated into the kingdom of Arnor. The Downs were revered because of the Great Barrows by the Arnorians, and buried their lords and Kings there.
After the split of Arnor in  the Barrow-downs became the capital of Cardolan. After Rhudaur fell to Angmar in , the Dúnedain of Cardolan entrenched themselves here, but eventually the realm fell.  Around  the Witch-king sent the Barrow-wights that haunted the hills, preventing any resettlement; after Arthedain once again claimed the kingship over all of Arnor the Dúnedain tried to recolonize Cardolan, but this failed because of the Barrow-wights.
When the Nazgûl came north in their hunt for the One Ring, the Witch-king stayed in the Barrow-downs for a few days, rousing the Barrow-wights.  On 28 September  Frodo Baggins and company were trapped in the downs by a wight, probably in the same uncommon words which held the grave of the last prince of Cardolan. They were rescued by Tom Bombadil, and there got their Daggers_of_Westernesse.
==Etymology==
In topography, a "down" is a low-lying hill, from the Old English dún meaning "hill".Joseph Bosworth and T. Northcote Toller, "http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/008106 DÚN" at An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (accessed 12 October 2010) In the wikipedia:United Kingdom, a wikipedia:Downland is a gently-rolling chalk hill in Southern wikipedia:England (seen especially in the wikipedia:North Downs and wikipedia:South Downs).http://oxforddictionaries.com/ Oxford Dictionaries, "http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0241750?rskey=YT9je8&result=4#m_en_gb0241750 down" (accessed 12 October 2010)
A "barrow" (or "berrow"; from English beorg, berg, hill, mound) not to be confused with the wheeled vehicle, is a tumulus or other prehistoric grave-mound., p. 766
The name therefore would represent an earlier Old English form Beorga Dune "downs of barrows".
Tyrn Gorthad was the Sindarin name of the Barrow-downs. Tyrn Gorthad is a compound of  torn ("down") and gorthad ("of buried")., p. 116 In one manuscript, the name Tyrn Goerthaid was used by J.R.R. Tolkien. Goerthaid seems to be the Sindarin#Plural of gorthad with affection vowels.

Later he attacked the Barrow-downs a second time to desecrate the barrows to create a plague to weaken the rest of Arnor and to demotalize the Dúnedain of Cardolan by using the barrows as the plagues ground zero. In the resulting battle Karsh, a general of Cardolan, was slain and Cardolans sent army was destroyed.
