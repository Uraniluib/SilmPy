Two-headed Trolls might have been a legendary race of Trolls, as Gandalf once said that "I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each." If Gandalfs statement was not merely a way of speaking, perhaps the two-headed Trolls lived in the Ettenmoors.See section "Inspiration" below
==Inspiration==
Etten, the first element in Ettensmoor, is a word derived from Old English eōten ("giant, troll, ogre")., p. 183, p. 770 It has been noted that Tolkien "probably thought of an ettin as a troll".Michael D.C. Drout, "http://oenewsletter.org/OEN/archive.php/essays/drout37_3/ An Anglo-Saxonist Gets his Fifteen Minutes: or, what happens when the media briefly pay attention" at http://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/index.php Old English Newsletter Online (accessed 10 March 2011) Historically, the Ettins have been represented as similar to giants, but with two heads. It is unknown if J.R.R. Tolkien was aware of this connection between Etten and the notion of Ettins as trolls or giants with two heads. However, in many other fictional fantasy worlds, the race of Ettin(s) are described as two-headed monsters.Dungeons and Dragons (1977), Monster Manual; see further Wikipedia:Ettin (Dungeons & Dragons) at Wikipediahttp://www.wowwiki.com/Ettin Ettin at http://www.wowwiki.com World of Warcraft Wiki (accessed 15 November 2010)
Commenting on Gandalfs words, John D. Rateliff has noted that trolls "with multiple heads appear in many stories", especially pointing to Wikipedia:George Webbe Dasents "Wikipedia:Soria Moria Castle"., p. 99 (note 9)
