The Pinnath Gelin or Green Hills was a fief in the far west of Gondor, bounded to the west by the River Lefnui, and to the east by the Morthond.
==History==
At the time of the War of the Ring, the lord of this region was Hirluin. He led three hundred of his soldiers to the defence of Minas Tirith, all dressed in green. Hirluin never went back to the Green Hills of his home - he was slain in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
==Etymology==
Usually translated as Green Hills, and sometimes as Green Downs,, p. 525 (citing from the Unfinished index) the meaning of the name Pinnath Gelin would be actually closer to Green Ridges, Green Slopes or Green Crests. The first word was the dialectical Sindarin or Gondor Sindarin pinnath. The second was the plural of the word calen, "green"., p. 24
