Fastitocalon was a legendary sea monster, apparently the last of the mighty Turtle-fish. He is only mentioned in Hobbits verse.
Fastitocalon was the size of a small island and vegetation would often grow on his back when not submerged, adding to his deceitful appearance as an actual island. Because of his huge size, sailors landed on his back only to drown when he dove underwater.
==Etymology==
Fastitocalon derives from the word astitocalon of the Shire-speech (rendered in English), which itself is an alteration or corruption of the Elvish Aspido-chelōne (rendered in Greek, meaning turtle with a round shield (of hide)). And "the F was put on by the versifier simply to make the name alliterate."; see also "Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)" (letter)
