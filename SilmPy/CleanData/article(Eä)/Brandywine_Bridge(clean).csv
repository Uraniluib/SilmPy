The Brandywine Bridge was the bridge on the East Road crossing the River Baranduin; it marked the eastern border of the Shire.
==History==
Originally called the Bridge of Stonebows, when the Hobbits first settled in the Shire the Kings of Arnor required them to keep the Great Bridge in repair.
Although unmentioned in his memoirs, Bilbo Baggins undoubtedly crossed and recrossed the bridge in  and  on his adventure to the Lonely Mountain.
Frodo Baggins and his companions did not use the bridge when they left the Shire in .  However, on their return trip they came to the bridge on 30 October .  To their surprise they found the bridge blocked on both ends with two spiked gates.  Despite a sign proclaiming "No admittance between sundown and sunrise" the four hobbits made their way over the bridge, after dispatching Bill Ferny.  They stayed the night at the guard-house before moving on to rouse the Shire.
In  King Aragorn rode to the Brandywine Bridge and greeted his old friends (but did not cross into the Shire for he himself had forbidden men to enter the land in an edict of ).  At this meeting he bestowed the Star of the Dúnedain on Samwise Gamgee and made Sams daughter Elanor Gardner a maid of honour to Queen Arwen.
==Etymology==
In Sindarin, the name of the bridge was i Varanduiniant. i is the singular definite article "the", which causes the initial b- in Baranduin#Etymology to take the Lenition form v- (i.e., Varanduin); the final element iant means "bridge"., p. 12
