The White Towers were three tall towers located in the Tower Hills west of the Shire. The westernmost tower, called Elostirion,, note 2 had a Elostirion-stone which looked ever westward towards Valinor., note 16 From the top of Elostirion it was said that one could view the Belegaer.
==History==
The White Towers were built on the Tower Hills by Gil-galad as a gift to Elendil, perhaps after the founding of Arnor ().
They were sometimes the destination of pilgrimage by Wandering Companies of Elves who would gaze to Valinor through the palant√≠r. Such a band, led by Gildor, met Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took in the Woody End of the Shire on 24 September .
In September  the Last Riding of the Keepers, including Frodo and Sam, passed the White Towers on their way to the Grey Havens.
