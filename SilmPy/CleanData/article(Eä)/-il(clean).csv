__NOTOC__
-il is a little-attested ending in the Sindarin language,Some of the examples refer to Noldorin as well used sometimes to denote feminine gender. Its masculine counterpart is -on.
Its presence causes i-affection to the vowels of the stem (cf. brannon and brennil).
==Etymology==
Possibly it derives from a Common Eldarin ending *-illê. This is supported by several Quenya words which end in -illë with Sindarin cognates in -il; most notably compare the Quenya amille "mother" and the Sindarin emil.
==Examples==
*emil "mother" p.5
*odhril "parent (referring to mother)"
*melethril "lover", The Etymologies
*brennil "lady"
*hiril "lady"
*Thuringwethil "secret-shadow woman"
In at least one case, -il is said to be a diminutive ending; compare how the masculine ending -on can sometimes refer to "great" things.
*niphredil "little pallor" (niphred)
*ernil "prince" (perhaps understood as *"little noble"; arn)
