Amon Darthir (Sindarin amon "steep-sloped mountain" + dartha- "to wait") was a mountain in the range of the Ered Wethrin, the Ered Wethrin that separated Dor-lómin to the north from Beleriand to the south. It stood near the house of Húrin in the south-east of Dor-lómin, and the springs of Nen Lalaith were among its northern slopes. The secret and difficult passes that ran beneath Amon Darthirs peak were the only way through the Ered Wethrin for many leagues in either direction., p. 67
