"Southerners" are an ill-defined group of people, generally referred to as such by Men of Bree. These men came up from the Greenway into Bree out of lands to the south around Dunland. They had come up into the Bree-land looking for a place of peace from the unrest in their homes, though a few such as the Squint-eyed Southerner were in fact spies of Saruman and were not to be trusted.
