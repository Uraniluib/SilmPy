Nornorë was a Valar in the earliest version of the legendarium, The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation). Nornorë was herald of the Gods and was sent to the Cuiviénen to invite the Eldar to come to Valinor. He was replaced in later versions of the legendarium by Eönwë and Oromë.
Nornorë played an important role in the afterlife of Men in this early version of the legendarium. Nienna would judge Men after they had died, sending some to Halls of Mandos or Angband, but sending others to Avathar aboard the ship Mornië. Of those sent to Arvalin, some very few would be retrieved by Nornorë, who brought them by chariot to dwell in Valmar until the Dagor Dagorath.
At the Chaining of Melkor, Nornorë ran before Manwës chariot when the host of the Valar marched against Utumno. As herald of the Gods, he was sent into the depths of Utumno to speak before the seat of Morgoth with cunning words contrived by the Gods. The ruse worked: Nornorë convinced Melko that the Gods had come to pay him homage. Melko, blinded by his pride, allowed Manwë and the rest of the Gods entry to his halls. Once inside, they were able to capture him and put him in chains.
When the Eldar awoke in Palisor, Nornorë was sent to them by the Valar as Manwës ambassador. Coming to Koivië-néni, he invited some of them to come with him to Valinor. Ingwë, Finwë, and Thingol heeded his call and he brought the three of them before the Gods, and then returned them to their folk at Koivië-néni. Upon returning, they convinced many of the Eldar to seek the Gods, and Nornorë brought the news to Valinor that the host of the Elves would indeed make the long journey west.
Nornorë did not appear in later versions of the legendarium. His role as herald of the Gods came to be filled by Eönwë, and Oromë became the Vala responsible for bringing Ingwë, Finwë, and Thingol to Valinor as representatives of the Eldar and then returning them to Cuiviénen.
