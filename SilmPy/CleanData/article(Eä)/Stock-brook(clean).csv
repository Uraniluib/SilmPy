The Stock-brook was a brook of the Shires Eastfarthing, and a minor tributary of the River Brandywine. It rose in the forested hills above Woody End, and from there flowed north-eastwards out into the fields of the Marish. It passed through the southern end of the village of Stock, from which it took its name, before emptying into the Brandywine a few miles north of Bucklebury Ferry.
On 25 September , Frodo Baggins, Peregrin Took, and Samwise Gamgee crossed the Stock-brook on their journey to Farmer Maggot house.
==Etymology==
David Salo suggested the name represents a possible "Old English" Se Stocbroc.
As it gets its name from the village of Stock, its meaning is "the brook running through Stock".
