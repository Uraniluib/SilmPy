__NOTOC__
The Watcher in the Water was a mysterious and horrific beast that lurked in a lake caused by the damming of the Sirannon river, beneath the western walls of Moria.  The full shape of the creature is unknown; its visible parts were its tentacles, which were long, sinuous, pale-green, and luminous, with a fingered end. There is very little known about the creature. Even Gandalf did not know what the Watcher was, or whether there were many of its kind.
==History==
In  an expedition led by Balin attempted to reclaim Moria.  Their activity attracted the attention of Orcs, who began to attack the Dwarves.  In  the Dwarves tried to escape from the mines but were stopped by the Watcher, who killed Óin.  When the Fellowship of the Ring found the Book of Mazarbul they read that "...the pool is up to the wall at Doors of Durin. The Watcher in the Water took Óin. We cannot get out."
On 13 January  the Watcher attacked the Fellowship just as they had opened the Doors of Durin to enter Moria. It grasped Frodo Baggins by the foot and attempted to drag him into the water.  Samwise Gamgee slashed the arm holding Frodo, causing it to release him.  The party retreated through the doorway, followed by several tentacles.  The creature possessed great strength; after the escape of the Fellowship into Moria, the arms hurled the enormous stone doors shut and uprooted the trees which grew to either side, barring the doors.  Silently Gandalf noted that it seized Frodo (as the Ring-bearers) first.

It has massive teeth in a small mouth, and great eyes set across from each other.
