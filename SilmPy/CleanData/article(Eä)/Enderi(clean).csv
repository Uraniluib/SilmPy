Enderi were the middle-days common to the Elves and the Númenórean calendars, and were counted outside the months.
In the Reckoning of Rivendell, three enderi were set between the seasons of Yávië and Quellë. Every twelfth year (except in every 432nd year), these enderi were doubled to six.
In the Kings Reckoning and Stewards Reckoning, there was only one enderë; the day of the Mid-years Day between the astar of Nárië and Cermië was called loëndë. In leap years (divisible by 4 but not 100) it was replaced by two enderi; in years divisible by 1000 loëndë was replaced by three enderi.
In the New Reckoning each year contained three enderi, between Yavannie and Narquelie; the middle of the three was referred to as loëndë.
