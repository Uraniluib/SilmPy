File:Peter Xavier Price - Amon Ereb.jpgAmon Ereb (Sindarin. amon "hill" + ereb "isolated, lonely"), sometimes just Ereb, was the broad, shallow-sided hill that dominated the southern plains of East Beleriand.
The hill was the highest point in that region and the easternmost hill of Andram, but was standing alone. Within sight of the Gelion, it had tremendous strategic importance, because it guarded the eastern passage around the Long Wall of the Andram into the southern parts of East Beleriand and the northern Taur-im-Duinath.
It was here that Denethor (Nando) of the Nandor met his end in the First Battle.  Much later, Caranthir fortified it to guard his escape into the south after the Dagor Bragollach and the Fëanorions withdrew there after Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

A small circle appears in Forlindon on Tolkiens early draft map for The Lord of the Rings., p. 302 Christopher Tolkien cannot explain this feature, p. 301 and notes that in his own 1943 redrawn map, the circular area is no longer present., p. 322 If one does a correct collage of Beleriand and Eriador maps, however, the small circular map seems to coincide with Amon Ereb.See notably the maps independently reconstructed by Charles Noad, "A Note on the Geography of the First Age" in Amon_Hen_(journal) no. Amon_Hen_38, April 1979, reprinted in Mallorn_(journal) no. Mallorn_27, September 1990, p. 40; Ronald Kyrmse, "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in Mallorn_(journal) no. Mallorn_26, September 1989, pp. 25–27; Didier Willis, "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" (French) in Tolkien, le façonnement dun monde (2014), vol. 2, pp. 197-212. This might suggest that Amon Ereb was once thought to have survived the submersion of Beleriand, although there is no textual evidence for it.
