Mordirith is a character created specifically for The Lord of the Rings Online. He is the main antagonist of The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, the first release and first Epic Volume of the game. He was the Wraiths steward of Carn Dûm.
The Witch-kings Steward, Mordirith, was once his greatest foe: Eärnur, Kings of Gondor. Eärnur was twice challenged by the Witch-king, and the second time he could not refuse. He rode into Minas Morgul and was never seen alive again. Mordirith later appeared in Angmar to rule in the Witch-kings stead, but few knew his true identity. Under Mordiriths rule, Orcs and evil Men multiplied in the remnants of the realm so that by the time of the War of the Ring Angmar posed a threat to the diminished peoples of Eriador.
After Mordirith was defeated in Angmar, his spirit returned to Minas Morgul, where he received another body from his master. He led the Morgul-host in the conquest of Osgiliath and the siege of Minas Tirith under a new name - Gothmog, the Dread Terror of Minas Morgul. After the defeat of Saurons forces at the Battle of Pelennor Fields, it appears that Gothmog shut himself in Minas Morgul, cut off from both Mordor and Ithilien, as the forces of the West destroyed the bridge leading to the Morgul Vale from the west and the spawn of Shelob took control of the Ephel Duath near Minas Morgul.
