Bears were large and ferocious animals, notorious for their love of honey., "Treebeard (chapter)"
==History==
Bears lived in the Misty Mountains for some time, though by the late Third Age, their number had diminished. Gandalf told Bilbo Baggins that giants had taken up their homes in that mountain range. One of the alleged origins of Beorn, the skin changer, was that he had descended from them., "Queer Lodgings" 
==Etymology==
Early Noldorin had two words for bear: brôg, "The Etymologies", entry MOROK and megli (with the variation meglivorn "Black bear"), "The Etymologies", entry LIS- In Sindarin, only the word graw is attested,, p. 12 (note 3) though Didier Willis also suggested the "updated" word Medli.Didier Willis, Elfling, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/4007 message 4007 A Quenya word for "bear" is given as morco, sharing a Sundocarmë with brôg. A variant Quenya name for "bear" is given as morokō (and mor(o)kē, "she-bear")., p. 82
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest outlines of The Fall of Gondolin (chapter), Tuor was clad in the skins of bears. The sinews of bears were also used to make bowstring, "The Lay of the Children of Húrin", line 1073 (page 47) and harp strings.
==Other fiction==
Bears play a significantly bigger role in other stories, most notably Mr. Bliss and The Father Christmas Letters. 
* The former included three mischievous bears Archie, Teddy and Bruno, who more resemble teddybears in Tolkiens drawings.J.R.R. Tolkien, Mr. Bliss, page 13 
* The North Polar Bear helped Father Christmas writing his letters by making side comments. Other polar bears were Paksu and Valkotukka.J.R.R. Tolkien, Baillie Tolkien (ed.), Letters from Father Christmas
