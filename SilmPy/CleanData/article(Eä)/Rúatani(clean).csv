Their own word for themselves was Drúedain, but the Elves adapted this into their own Sindarin language as Drû (from which the more common Drúedain derives). From Sindarin, the word passed into Quenya, but again it was changed, and became Rú. From this comes the plural form Rúatani (Rú-Men) which is the direct Quenya equivalent of Drúedain., note 6
