Mindolluin or Mount Mindolluin was the easternmost peak of the Ered Nimrais (White Mountains), below and to the east of which stood the city of Minas Tirith.
There was an ancient steep path into the southern foothills of Mindolluin, leading to a high hallow far above the city where only the Kings of Gondor visited. Standing in this spot one could look over a precipice to the towers of the city far below.

Shortly after Aragorns coronation as Elessar, on 25 JuneThe date is problematic, as the narrative in the chapter The Steward and the King suggests that the sapling was planted before June., Gandalf took him by the forgotten path to the high hallow where the newly crowned king could view the vastness of his realm. When he remarked that the White Tree of Gondor in the Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith) was still Dead Tree, Gandalf bade him to turn about. Opposite the precipice was an otherwise barren stony slope upon which one growing thing could be seen, a sapling of the line of Nimloth of NÃºmenor. Aragorn removed the tree and brought it to the Citadel for planting as a sign of rebirth, and for Arwen to come to Gondor and be his queen.
