Entmaidens were young female Ents or young Entwives. When Treebeard, talking to Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, remembered old times, when "the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild", he said that "there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth!"
