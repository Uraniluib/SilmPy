Lintips were mysterious creatures only mentioned in Hobbits verse. Escaping and laughing at Tom Bombadil, he complains saying they are the "only things that wont talk to me, say what they do or what they be".J.R.R. Tolkien, "Once upon a Time", in The Young Magicians (ed. Lin Carter)
==Inspiration==
As in the case of the Mewlips, Tolkien fandom have "failed to identify a source of the lintips"., p. 689 Rhona Beare has suggested that the lintips are "tiny Spirits (creatures)", similar to (or same as) the "gleaming spirits" appearing in Tolkiens poem An Evening in Tavrobel., p. 284
