The Thains Book was a copy of the Red Book of Westmarch made in the Shire and later augmented with additions made in Minas Tirith.
==History==
The contents of the Thains Book had various authors. The oldest material came from the diary of Bilbo Baggins, which he took with him to Rivendell after . In  Frodo Baggins brought Bilbos writings with him back to the Shire, and between  and  he added account of the War of the Ring. All of this material was contained in four large red leather volumes; in Westmarch a fifth volume of commentaries, genealogies, and other Hobbits matters were added.  At this point these writings were referred to as the Red Book of Westmarch.
The actual Thains Book was a copy of the Red Book that was produced in Gondor. Thain Peregrin Took retired to Gondor in  and took with him a copy of the Red Book as requested by King Aragorn. In Minas Tirith this book received many annotations and corrections (particularly of Elvish names, words, and quotations). It was also enhanced with an abbreviated  version of "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen", written by Barahir (grandson of Faramir), the grandson of Faramir. In  the Kings Writer, Findegil, made an exact copy of the book in Minas Tirith, which was returned to the Shire at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin and kept in the Great Smials.  The copy written by Findegil was of special interest in that it alone preserved Bilbos "Translations from the Elvish", written between  and  that used sources available in Rivendell.
