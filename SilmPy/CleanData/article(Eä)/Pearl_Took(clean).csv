Pearl Took was a Hobbits of the Shire.
==History==
Pearl was the eldest child of Thain Paladin Took II and Eglantine Banks. She was the caretaker of Lalia Clayhanger, the rotund, aged, and immensely annoying (to the Tooks) matriarch of the family. Each morning, Pearl was to push her wheelchair outside so Lalia could experience fresh air.
In  she was a guest at Bilbos Farewell Party. 
One morning in , Pearl was a little bit careless in her custom of tending old Lalia, and the matriarch flew across the steps to her death. Pearl was excluded from the accession ceremony of Ferumbras Took III, who had been waiting to become head of the clan for quite a while (he had already been Thain since the death of his father). She was, however, afterwards spotted with a necklace of pearls believed to be a Took family heirloom.
