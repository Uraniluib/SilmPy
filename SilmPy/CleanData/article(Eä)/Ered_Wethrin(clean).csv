The Ered Wethrin, or the Mountains of Shadow, was a mountain range in the north of Middle-earth in the First Age. 
They were among the mountains raised about Hithlum during the Siege of Utumno. 
A line of hills to the southwest formed the southern boundary of Nevrast. In the south, it was an east-west range that divided Dor-lómin and Mithrim to the north from Beleriand to the south, then in the east it curved around to the northwest, forming the boundary of Hithlum and separating it from Anfauglith. The Mountains of Mithrim were a northwesterly spur that separated Dor-lómin from Mithrim. 
Several rivers arose in the Ered Wethrin, including Narog, Taeglin, and Sirion; by the Eithel Sirion of Sirion, by the foothills of the Mountains, Fingolfin built Barad Eithel. 
The Ered Wethrin disappeared beneath the waves at the end of the First Age.
