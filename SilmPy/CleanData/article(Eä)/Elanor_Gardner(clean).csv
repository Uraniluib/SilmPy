Elanor Fairbairn (née Gamgee or Gardner) was the first child of Master Samwise Gamgee and his wife Rose Cotton. 
==Life==
Called "The Fair" for her golden hair, she was born 25 March  by Shire Calendar (which was ), which was at the same time the first day of the Fourth Age in Gondor. Elanor was also the only one of Samwises children known to the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins, and her name was a suggestion by him.
In  Elanor became a maid of honor to Queen Arwen, and in  she married Fastred of Greenholm. Fourth Age 34, Fastred was named Warden of Westmarch by the Thain at the request of Samwise. Elanor and her husband then moved to the Undertowers on the Tower Hills where their family (becoming known as the Fairbairn Family) would live for many generations.
After her fathers passing to the Undying Lands in , Elanor and her line became the keepers of the Red Book of Westmarch. Her two children were Elfstan Fairbairn, born in , and Fíriel Fairbairn., note 2
==Etymology==
The name is a reference to the Elanor (flower), a little golden flower blooming in the land of Lothlórien — this perfectly satisfied Sams desire for a name that was both Elvish and yet at the same time a simple flower-name as many hobbit-lasses had.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Besides her presence as an infant in the last chapter of the published The Lord of the Rings, and the details noted in the appendices of that book, Elanors most significant role was in the two versions of the written but unpublished The Epilogue of The Lord of the Rings. In that epilogue Elanor talks with her father about the importance of the events that transpired in the story and also about the coming of King Aragorn and Queen Arwen for a visit. Elanors affectionate name for her father is "Sam-dad", while Sam calls her "Elanorellë".
