The Tower Hills (Sindarin Emyn Beraid) were a range of hills at the west end of Eriador. They lay east of Grey Havens, the Grey Havens of Lindon, and west of the White Downs, of old the border of the Shire.
High upon the Tower Hills stood three tall Elves towers, the White Towers, the highest of which was called Elostirion, which held a Palantíri., Note 2
==History==
In , when the first ship of the Númenóreans sailed up the Gulf of Lune there was a meeting between the men from the sea and their distant kinsmen in the Tower Hills.
The White Towers upon the Tower Hills were built before the end of the Second Age by Gil-galad for his friend Elendil.
During the Third Age, Wandering Companies would go in pilgrimage to Elostirion in order to have a glimpse of the West through the Elostirion-stone. The Stone remained in its tower until the end of the Age; it was then taken back into the West.
In  the Westmarch was added to the Shire, making the Tower Hills the new western border of the land. Three years later Thain Peregrin Took made Fastred of Greenholm the first Warden of Westmarch. He and his wife Elanor Gardner, daughter of Samwise Gamgee, moved to the Tower Hills and founded the town of Undertowers on the eastern slopes.
