Crows are black omnivorous birds sometimes associated with battles due to their taste for carrion.
==History==
The crows encountered by Bilbo Baggins and the Thorin and Company during the quest to Lonely Mountain in  were mostly harmless.  During the scouting expedition to the Front Gate of the Lonely Mountain the crows were considered "ominous" and Balin distrusted them, though later he called them merely "nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude as well".
The most feared variety in the Westlands of Middle-earth was the large type known as crebain.  On 8 January  the Fellowship of the Ring entered Hollin and were spied upon by these large crows from Fangorn Forest and Dunland.  The Rohirrim were aware that Saruman made use of crebain; on 30 February Éomer told Aragorn that Sarumans "birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky". Crows may actually just be another name for Ravens as they looked and acted exactly the same.
==Etymology==
A Quenya word for "crow" is quáko, derived from Primitive Quendian k(a)wāk., p. 395 Another Quenya word for "crow" is korko, and the Noldorin cognate of the same meaning is corch., p. 362 (root KORKA) In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens very early conceptions of an Elvish language, the word for "crow" is crunc (pl. crunghin)., p. 27
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In J.R.R. Tolkiens plot notes for the second phase of writing The Hobbit, there was no distinction between crows and ravens as ominous birds., p. 362  When the scouting party went to view the Front Gate Balin did not like the ravens nearby, stating that they looked "like spies of evil"., p. 472  However, when the Company needed to learn of the death of Smaug Tolkien "rehabilitated" the ravens, making them friendly to the Dwarves, and replaced all negative raven-references with crows., note 4, p. 479
