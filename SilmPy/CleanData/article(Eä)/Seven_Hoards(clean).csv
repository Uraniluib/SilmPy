The Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings were legendary treasures of the Dwarves. The name suggests that each hoard belonged to one of the :Category:Dwarven clans. As it is said, the foundation of each was a golden ring, and probably they were gathered thanks to the Seven Rings given to the Dwarves by Sauron in the Second Age.
By the Third Age, those hoards were plundered, and devoured by Dragons.
Scatha and Smaug claimed dwarven-hoards, but it is not known if they were two of the Seven Hoards.
