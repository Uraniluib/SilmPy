==History==
Baranor is a descendent of a noble family from Númenor, who were loyal to Elendil. When the Valar destroyed Númenor, they went into exile to Middle-earth. They lived in Arnor, where they served the Kings of Arnor and, after the fall of Arnor, the Chieftains of the Dúnedain.
Baranor lived in the Angle (Eriador), where he served as a Rangers of the North, and had one son, Eradan. In the time of Aragorn he was lost while patrolling the Misty Mountains. Afterwards his son was fostered by his brother, Dunhir.
