Wargs or Wild Wolves were a race of evil wolves, as called by the Northmen of Rhovanion.
==Characteristics==
Wargs were an evil breed of Demons wolves,J.R.R. Tolkien, "Letter to Gene Wolfe" (letter) suggesting that they were inhabited by evil spirits. The origin of the breed is unknown - perhaps they were among the creatures bred by Morgoth in the Elder Days., p. 218 In any case, Gandalf listed the Wargs among Saurons servants in the late Third Age.
The Wargs were seen in  Rhovanion and they were often allied with the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, and used as mounts. Wargs were sentient and used a tongue, the "Warg-language".
==History==
File:Ron Walotsky - Wargs.jpg
In , the Wargs appeared once to meet the Orcs and organize a raid to the nearby villages, in order to drive the Woodmen out and capture some slaves. As a pack of Wargs approached east of the Misty Mountains to meet them, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and Thorin and Company were escaping the goblins. Gandalf seeing the pack coming, suggested to climb the trees and Dori helped Bilbo in the nick of time. 
The Wargs, thinking that the Dwarves are allies of the Woodmen, surrounded the glade and didnt let them descend. Gandalf then used his magic to light up pinecones and hurl them against the Warg until he drove them out. The wolves that had caught fire fled into the forest and had set it alight in several places, since it was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. However the guards left under the trees did not go away. Eventually Goblins showed up and lit the trees the Dwarves were onto, until the Eagles came to rescue them.
The Goblins and the Wargs insisted on looking for the band, since Gandalf had killed the Great Goblin, and also burnt the chief wolfs nose. They went as far as Beorns homestead, but he caught a pair of them and stuck the goblins head outside the gate and nailed the warg-skin to a tree just beyond
Wargs appeared once more, ridden by the Goblins, at the Battle of Five Armies. After this, the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear.
A band of Wargs, unaccompanied by Orcs, attacked the Fellowship of the Ring in Eregion.
==Etymology and names==
J.R.R. Tolkien derived the word warg from Old English wearg-, Old High German warg-, and Old Norse varg-r., all of these terms literally translating to strangler, choker.Douglas A. Anderson, The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition, pp. 146-7, note 9 The word specifically is understood to be Northern Mannish which "caught on" throughout the Westlands.
While Norse vargr was a common synonym for wolf, Old English wearg was used only for an outlaw or hunted criminal., "Appendix C: Old English Poem of Attila", p. 373 (note 37)
In a list of Old English equivalents of Elvish words, Balrogs#Etymology is glossed as having the equivalent Bealuwearg. As noted by Christopher Tolkien, the Old English word contains the elements bealu ("evil"; as in bale(ful)) and wearg ("wolf, outlaw"; whence the Wargs)., p. 209
==Inspiration and influences==
In Old Norse mythology, wargs (vargr, a synonym for "wolf", ulfr) are in particular the wolf wikipedia:Fenrir and his sons wikipedia:Skoll and wikipedia:Hati.
Tolkien mentioned in a letter that the episode of wargs in The Hobbit was "in part derived from a scene" in Wikipedia:Samuel Rutherford Crocketts novel The Black Douglas.
Tolkien also noted that Gene Wolfe, one of his readers, seems to have picked up his concept of the Wargs, which occurs in Wolfes science fiction short story "Trip, Trap" (1967): "There was also what looked like a very big wild dog or wolf, a Warg"., p. 225, note 7 John D. Rateliff has further commented that Tolkiens Wargs were likely influential on the creation of the wolf-like beasts Wikipedia:Worg (Dungeons & Dragons) in later literature related to Dungeons and Dragons and in other fantasy worlds.

===Radio===
1968: The Hobbit (1968 radio series):

===Films===
1977: The Hobbit (1977 film):
:Wargs are seen as large wolves ridden by Goblins. They do not have a fear of fire. 
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Wargs appear to be more like a "hyena-bear-wolf hybrid" rather than wolves, in an effort to distinguish them from regular wolves by presenting them as some sort of distant cousin.  However, it should be noted that Tolkien never actually described Wargs beyond stating they were demonic wolves.
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:The Wargs are visually more wolf-like than in the preceding The Lord of the Rings (film series). They are mentioned to be from Gundabad and are ridden by Orcs under Azog who hunt Thorin and Co. Azog himself rides an enormous Warg Matriarch.
===Games===
1982-1997: Middle-earth Role Playing:
:Classified as Undead Beings, the Wargs are said to be bred from cursed wolves, inhabited by an evil spirit, "being artificially long-lived", and that their "body dissipates when slain". The Wargs are described as being larger, fiercer, and more intelligent than normal wolves., p. 129, p. 151
1995-8: Middle-earth Collectible Card Game: 
:Wargs are a Hazard Creature. Different factions of Wargs are the Wargs of the Forochel and the Misty Mountain Wargs, and related minions are the War-warg and The Warg-king.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Wargs are taller and darker than regular wolves, but due to the progression in the game, pose less of a threat; whereas wolves are only encountered by a stick-wielding Frodo Baggins, wargs appear only in levels in which the player is Gandalf or Aragorn.
2003: The Hobbit (2003 video game):
:Wargs are portrayed as large wolves. They only appear in cutscenes, and are non-fightable.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Non-player (NPC, computer controlled) wargs are found in a number of areas of Middle-earth. Players can play a warg in the Player-versus-Player (PvP) area of the Ettenmoors once the player reaches level ten. Wargs in Lord of the Rings Online have the ability to stealth and sneak up to attack players.
:The appearance of wargs vary from zone to zone for NPC wargs and from rank to rank for player controlled wargs. They all look like very large wolves with broad shoulders. They range in color from white to grey to black. Many of them have black eyes but some of the stronger wargs have red eyes.
