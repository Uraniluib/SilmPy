The Merlock Mountains are mentioned in the The Shire-poem The Mewlips.  
It is unknown if the Merlock Mountains refer to an actual mountain range in Middle-earth, or if they were just an invention by the poet. As the poem describes a location similar to Mirkwood,, entry "Mewlips, the" it is possible that they were a fictitious version of the Misty Mountains, or what the Hobbits knew about them., p. 260
==Etymology==
Tolkien fandom have speculated that the name Merlock was inspired by the name Morlock appearing in Tolkiens earlier poem "Knocking at the Door" (which was perhaps itself inspired by Wikipedia:H. G. Wellss Wikipedia:Morlock)
