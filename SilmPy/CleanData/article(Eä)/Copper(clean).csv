Copper was a metal familiar to the smiths of Middle-earth.  Mahtan, the father of Nerdanel (the wife of Fëanor), prized this metal above gold.  He wore a band of copper about his head and was known as Urundil or "copper-lover"., note 61 There were objects of copper and bronze in the hoards of the Barrow-downs.
==Etymology==
From the root RUN meaning "red, glowing" came the Quenya word Urun for copper.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Copper was one of the six metals used by Aulë to create the alloy Tilkal.  It was used to forge the great chain Angainor to bind Morgoth.  In a footnote, it was explained that "tilkal" was an acronym formed from the initial letters for each of the six metals.  The first letter, t came from tambë, which was apparently the word for "copper"., p. 100
