The Rider was a shadowy creature of Elvish legend, sent by Morgoth to trouble the first Elves at Cuiviénen. The true identity of the Rider is unknown. The legend could have had its source in lies spread by Morgoth about Oromë, in an attempt to deceive the Elves into thinking that he was evil. It is also possible that the Rider was one of the "shadows and Spirits (creatures)" sent by Melkor to spy upon and harass the Quendi, or even Melkor himself.
