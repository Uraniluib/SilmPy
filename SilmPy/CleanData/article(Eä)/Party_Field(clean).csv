The Party Field was a large field south of Bilbo Baggins front door adjacent to Bagshot Row near  Hobbiton. For Bilbos Farewell Party it was covered with tents and pavilions; underneath the largest pavilion was the Party Tree where Bilbo made his farewell speech.
After the destruction of the Party Tree by Sharkey and his Ruffians, Samwise Gamgee planted a mallorn tree, upon his return from the Quest of the Ring. Afterwards it was used for holidays and celebrations by the Hobbits of that region.
