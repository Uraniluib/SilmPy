The Second Hall was one of many Halls of Moria. Between the Second and the First Hall - counting from the Great Gates of the city - lay the ill-fated Bridge of Khazad-dûm in the First Deep. 
In  Orcs joined battle with the Dwarves of Balins Colony in the hall. During the Battle of the Second Hall Lóni, Náli and Frár were killed while the rest escaped to the Seventh Level, allowing the Orcs to reclaim the Hall.
It was the largest encountered by the Fellowship of the Ring while they traversed Moria. On their way to the First Hall they met Durins Bane, and where Gandalf fell into the chasm.
