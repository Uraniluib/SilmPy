The Westfarthing was one of the four Farthings of the Shire. Its easternmost point was the Three-Farthing Stone and on its western border were the Far Downs (and later, from  on, the region of Westmarch). Within its bounds was the "capital" of the Shire, Michel Delving and the ancestral homeland of the Took Family (and thus the seat of the Thain), known as Tookland. Also, in the Westfarthing was Hobbiton, the home of Bilbo Baggins and his nephew, Frodo Baggins.

==History==
Perhaps the most significant event regarding Westfarthing was when Isumbras Took I became a Thain in , beginning the hereditary Thainship of the Took line. Thus Westfarthing was the centre of Hobbit "authority".
In , the Unexpected Party occurred in the home of Bilbo Baggins at Bag End in the West Farthing, and from the Green Dragon in Bywater, the Quest of Erebor began. When Bilbo returned the next year he had to deal with an auction of his belongings since he had been presumed dead.
To celebrate his 111th and Frodo Baggins 33rd birthdays as well as his departure from the Shire, in  Bilbo held a Farewell Party.
On 23 September , Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took left Bag End heading for Crickhollow.
Upon their return from their adventures in the south, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Meriadoc Brandybuck returned to the Shire and in the Westfarthing they were the leaders in the Battle of Bywater, on 1 November 
==Culture==
Every seven years the Mayor of Michel Delving was elected at the Free Fair on the White Downs at Lithe.
As Westfarthing was the centre of Hobbit authority, the dialect of the Westfarthing (in scattered parts) had retained the deferential pronoun of the proper Westron which was lost in other forms of Hobbitish language. It was used more as a light-hearted term of endearment.
