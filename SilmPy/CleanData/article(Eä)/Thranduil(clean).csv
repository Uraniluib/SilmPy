Thranduil first appears in the level "Barrels Out of Bond", in which he can be overheard speaking about the White Council and their attack on Dol Guldur. He returns as a conversation partner in the last level, "The Clouds Burst", in which he and Gandalf ask the player, in the persona of Bilbo, to deliver a message to Bard.

2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Mentionng his past, Thranduil is portrayed as a widower and also an isolationist king who isnt concerned with the evil that happens beyond his borders. He has generously raised Tauriel for the last 600 years, and also mentions that he has fought the "cold-drakes".
:When Thorin is taken before Thranduil in the Elvenkings Halls, he surmises that he and his Thorin and Company are going to try to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug (unlike in the book, where he had no idea as to their purpose). He offers a deal to Thorin, saying he will let the Company go if they will pay him the white jewels he desires inside the Mountain. When the Dwarf refuses and chastises him for not offering aid to the Dwarves of Erebor the day of the Sack, the Elven-king reveals a large disfigurement on his face underneath his skin, mentioning his fighting against the great serpents of the North. 
:Later, an unseen Bilbo Baggins spies his discussion with Tauriel, having ordered her company of Elves to destroy the spiderss nests, but not beyond the borders of the Woodland Realm, displayng his disregard for the outside world.
:He and Legolas interrocgate Narzug, a captured Orcs who claims that Sauron is returning, and will unleash a powerful weapon (possibly Smaug). Despite his own promise to "set him free", he beheads the orc, and orders the kingdom to be completely sealed off from the outside world.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:After learning of Smaugs demise, Thranduil leads his Elven army to claim the white jewels from the Dwarves of Erebor, even by force. It is revealed that these jewels were meant for his wife, who had been taken to Gundabad and tortured to death many years prior. When the army arrives in Dale, he forges an allegiance with Bard, also offering the Lake-town refugees food and supplies. When Gandalf arrives at Erebor to warn them of the impending attack by the approaching Orc army, the Elven-king refuses to listen. Thranduils soldiers come to clashes with those of Dáin Ironfoot right before the Orcs arrive, leading to the Battle of Five Armies. Thranduil himself fights in the battle against the Orcs, but withdraws his forces when defence of Dale results in many Elven casualties. This leads to a confrontation between him and Tauriel before she and Legolas go to Thorins aid at Ravenhill. The event causes a rift between Thranduil and his son, to the point where Legolas decides not to return to the kingdom. Thranduil then advises him to go and find the Rangers of the North known as "Strider (Aragorn)" among the Dúnedain. The Elven-king also accepts Tauriels love for Kíli when he finds her mourning over the Dwarfs death.
