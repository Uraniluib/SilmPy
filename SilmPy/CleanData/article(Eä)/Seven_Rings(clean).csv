The Seven Dwarf-rings were the Rings of Power given to seven Dwarves Lords by Sauron in the guise of Annatar. Apparently the Lords were the Kings of the Seven Houses, as Gandalf mentions that the Rings were given to the "Dwarf-kings".
The most famous was the Ring of Thrór: in Dwarven tradition it was said Celebrimbor gave the Ring to Durin III king of Durins Folk before the Downfall of Eregion, but this seems unlikely as Celebrimbor was said to have yielded the Seven - all the Seven - to Sauron after torture.
The Dwarf Lords proved resistant to the malevolent magic of the rings, which could not even turn them invisible, as they are hard to tame, and thoughts of their hearts are hidden. The rings, used only for the gaining of wealth, amplified their wearers natural skills and desire of dominion which as a consequence, made them greedy and exceedingly rich; the Rings gave them the power to multiply whatever they mined. It is said that thanks to them the Seven Hoards were made. But also the Rings kindled greed and wrath in the Dwarves, bringing evils that in the long-term benefitted Sauron.
Four were swallowed or destroyed by Dragons, but Sauron succeeded in finding two. The last one was worn by Thráin, but in  he was imprisoned by Sauron in the dungeons of Dol Guldur, and the ring was taken from him.

2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: 
:The Seven appear in the introduction of the movie, worn by Dwarf kings. They are designed consistently to the general Dwarven aesthetics of the movie, with angular, crystalline shapes. However nowhere in Tolkiens books is mentioned that the Seven were designed or made for the Dwarves.FAQ of the Rings: http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q79-Differ How did the Seven and the Nine differ? and http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q79-Intent Were the Seven and Nine Rings originally intended for Dwarves and Men?
