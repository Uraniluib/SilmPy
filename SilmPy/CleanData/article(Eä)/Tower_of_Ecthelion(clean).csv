The Tower of Ecthelion, also known as the White Tower, was a tall white tower atop Minas Tirith which contained the throne of the Kings of Gondor and a secret room housing a palantíri. Although a tower had graced the highest point of Minas Tirith since ancient times, it was rebuilt by Steward Ecthelion I some three centuries before the War of the Ring, and so gained his name. 
The Tower had "its eye upon many lands". It was because of this Tower that the city was later named Minas Tirith ("Tower of the Guard").

The Tower of Ecthelion was 50 fathoms (300 feet) tall. The plain white standard of the Stewards of Gondor flew from its pinnacle. The Tower stood in the center of the Citadel of Gondor on the seventh level of the city. In front of the Tower was the Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith) where the White Tree of Gondor grew.
Under the sun, the Towers shapely form shone and glimmered like a spike of crystals, pearl and silver against the sky. White banners waved from its battlements.
In the Tower Hall was the throne of the King of Gondor upon a dais, and at the foot the dais on the lowest step was a black chair where the Stewards of Gondor sat. The royal court must have been also there., entry "White Tower"
There was a chamber high in the Tower and above it in the summit, just under its dome, there was a secret room where the palantír of Minas Anor, the Anor-stone was kept.
