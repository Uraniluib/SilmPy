The Elves of Lindon were those Elves who dwelt in Lindon in the west of Middle-earth, between the Blue Mountains and the Belegaer, in the Second Age and Third Ages. 
==Population==
The original Elves of Lindon (Ossiriand) in the First Age, were Laiquendi, but were presumably joined by other Elves of the former Beleriand (Noldor and Sindar) who survived the War of Wrath and did not accept the invitation of the Valar to sail to Aman. The Elves of Harlindon were mostly Sindar, ruled by Celeborn., Note 2 
Early in the Second Age, some of the Sindar were uneasy living among the Noldor under Gil-galad and left for the east or the south.
In the Third Age, the Elves of Lindon consisted most of the Eldar that still lingered in Middle-earth. Few remained in the Fourth Age, if at all.
==History==
The Elves built the Grey Havens in the newly-formed Gulf of Lune whence the Eldar could sail the Straight Road, but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in, and preferred to linger there. Although many Sindar left Lindon the Elves reached the height of their power in the Second Age under King Gil-galad. 
A fair being calling himself Annatar, emmissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance. Gil-galad and Master Elrond sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. Messengers were sent from Lindon with warnings; but they were unheeded, and Annatar was received gladly, mostly in Eregion. However Gil-galad and Elrond were proven correct, as Annatar was indeed Sauron and later War of the Elves and Sauron. Elrond came out of Lindon with Elves in Sack of Eregion. With them, and other Elves who fled the destruction of Eregion, he established Imladris in .
In the Dark Years Sauron had conquered most of the Westlands, but in  Tar-Minastir sent a fleet to Lindon, aiding the Elves to drive Sauron out of Eriador. Saurons army was driven back to Sarn Ford where they were defeated and withdrew to Tharbad.
At the end of the Age, Gil-galad joined the Last Alliance and led his armies to the War of the Last Alliance. Some of the Silvan Elves felt hostility towards the Noldor, and those under Oropher and Amdir attacked independedly, suffering heavy losses. 
===After Gil-galad===
After the War and the death of Gil-galad, Cirdan remained the only Lord of the Havens. During the Third Age, the Elves of Lindon under Cirdan supported Arnor in the Angmar War. They assisted Arveleg and the men of Cardolan drive off the Hill-men from the Weather Hills. Later, with Círdan’s help, Arvelegs young son, Araphor, drove Angmars armies from Fornost and the North Downs. Combining forces with Rivendell, and the Galadhrim who joined them from beyond the Misty Mountains, they subdued Angmar for some time.

In , Elven sailors from Lindon brought a ship to Forochel to rescue the lost king Arvedui.  The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished.  The next year the elves joined with the Dúnedain in the victorious Battle of Fornost.
For the course of the Third Age, the Elves of Lindon built ships for the Elves who wished to return to the Blessed Realm and they didnt seem to participate in greater events. During the War of the Ring Galdor of the Havens was sent to Rivendell for an errand, and incidentally he represented Cirdan in the Council of Elrond.
