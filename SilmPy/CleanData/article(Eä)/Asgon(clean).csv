Asgon was a man of Dor-lómin in the days when it was overrun by the Easterlings following the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.  He became an outlaw in the Ered Wethrin after Túrin killed Brodda.  Later, Asgon met Húrin, gave him an account of his sons deeds, and followed him in his wanderings.
==Asgon and Túrin ==
In , p. 257  when Túrin returned to Dor-lómin after twenty-three years of absence, he came to Broddas hall seeking news of the whereabouts of his mother Morwen and sister Nienor.  Due to his rashness Túrin killed Brodda and provoked a brief rebellion against the Easterlings.  When he left, those who had joined in the battle followed him, and Asgon was one of these.  As the party climbed into the mountains they saw that Broddas hall was on fire and Asgon reproved Túrin for thinking Aerin weak.  Túrin left the rebels in a cave in the mountains where Asgon told him that they would be hunted men because of Túrins deed and that he should not return unless it was with enough strength to deliver them., pp. 190-191
==Asgon and Húrin ==
After Túrins death his father Húrin was released by Morgoth (in ).  Wandering in Hithlum, Húrin met a small company of homeless men lurking in the hills.  Asgon was their leader and he reported Túrins deeds in Brodda’s hall.  Asgon and six others willingly followed Húrin when marched up to the halls of the Easternling Lorgan, who called himself the Lord of Hithlum.  Húrin defied Lorgan who determined to let him leave untouched.  When Húrin left Hithlum, Asgon led him through one of the mountain passes.  Asgon and the others travelled on with Húrin, but at the edge of the Forest of Brethil he left them while they slept and traveled alone into Dimbar.
With Húrin gone, the seven followers were uncertain of what to do.  Although one, Ragnir (outlaw), counseled returning home, Asgon decided that they ought to go into Brethil.  Asgon led the party into the forest where they were captured by the Haladin.  The captain of this guard, Ebor, had them blindfolded and led to Hardang, the new Chieftain of the Haladin, who looked unkindly upon the party from Dor-lómin.  Hardang ordered Asgon and his men to be thrust from Brethil without their weapons, which Asgon called the justice of Easterlings not of Edain.  Asgon declared that Húrin was coming, news which put Hardang in fear and doubt.  Asgon and his party were blindfolded again and led away, where the march-warden Ebor returned to them their weapons and gear.  Asgon, believing that someday Húrin  would come to Brethil, established his men west of the forest to keep watch from afar. , pp. 261-265
Unfortunately the fate of Asgon is unknown, for the detailed story of Húrins wanderings was left unfinished before Húrin departed from Brethil.
