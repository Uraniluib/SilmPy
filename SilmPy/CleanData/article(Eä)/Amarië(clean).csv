__NOTOC__
Amarië (Quenya, pron. ) was a Vanyarin Elves who was loved by Finrod.
Finrod, son of Finarfin, was a Noldorin prince who met Amarië in Valinor. Although in love with one another, they did not marry and Amarië did not follow Finrod into exile to Beleriand; according to The Grey Annals this was because she was not permitted. Following Finrods death, at the hands of Sauron during the Quest for the Silmaril, he was brought back to life and lives with Amarië in Valinor.
==Etymology==
The name is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. Helge Fauskanger suggests that this Quenya name is perhaps derived from mára "good". 
Another possibility is that the name includes the element mar, "home" Ruth S. Noel makes a similar interpretation and defines Amarië as "Of the Home".Ruth S. Noel, The Languages of Tolkiens Middle-earth (revised edition), p. 108
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Originally Finrod had a wife named Meril who went into exile and bore the child Gil-galad who were both sent to dwell in the Havens of the Falas for their safety., p. 242 This was later to changed so Finrod had no child - with Gil-galad becoming the son of Orodreth, Finrods nephew - and Amariës beloved remaining in Aman., p. 349
