Envinyatar, the Renewer, was a title claimed by Aragorn after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It referred to the prophecy - soon to be fulfilled - that he would renew the hope of the DÃºnedain by reuniting the Reunited Kingdom.
==Etymology==
Helge Fauskanger has suggested that Envinyatar, which literally menas "Renewer",, p. 395 (note 13) is formed from the unattested Quenya verb envinyata- ("renew") + Wikipedia:agentive ending -ro.Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/affix~1.htm Quenya Affixes" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 15 December 2011)
