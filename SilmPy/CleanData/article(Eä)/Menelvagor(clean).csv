==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The constellation entered into the story only in the latest phases of its composition. In earlier versions of the manuscript of The Lord of the Rings the Elves begun to sing as the yellow moon rose, (p. 61) and in a later revision in the East the thin silver rind of the New Moon appeared (p. 325) due to Tolkiens calculations considering the phases of the Moon; (cf. p. 434) still there was a fault: the Moon would not have risen from the East at that time of the year; (p. 325) thus the Moon was finally changed to the apparition of Menelvagor and other stars.
