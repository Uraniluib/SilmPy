1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Paul Brooke played Gríma.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from The Hunt for the Ring when he is questioned by the Nazgul on his way to Isengard.  His death at Bag End is also included in the final episode.
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Gríma is played by Brad Dourif. The reason for Grímas pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Saruman he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Gollum to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Wormtongue was one of the "bad guys" in the large and confusing cast of characters.
:The events of "The Scouring of the Shire" do not appear in the film version, so Sarumans death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the tower of Orthanc, the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. Sarumans body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his war machines. Gríma himself is shot by an arrow fired by Legolas, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Saruman blamed Gríma for killing Théodred, replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.
