Demons were a race of spirits (creatures) that ranked among the most powerful of Morgoths servants. The chief of the demons were the Balrogs, seduced to Morgoths service in the beginning of the world. It seems the Dark Lord also had other lesser demons at his command. ("...countless became the hosts of Morgoths beasts and his demons")
