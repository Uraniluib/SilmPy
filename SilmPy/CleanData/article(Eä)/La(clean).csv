__NOTOC__
la or lá (whenever stressed) is a negation adverb meaning "no, not"., pp. 32-33
The word can get pronominal endings as if a negative verb when a verb is not expressed, apparently where the phrase "is not" is followed by a noun or an adjective as a predicate, or where some verb is understood , as in English "I do not".

In another conceptual phase of Tolkiens, lá had the opposite meaning "yes".
Tolkien considered that the negation could receive tense markers however he later reconsidered it. The tenses where la was attested are:
*la (aorist)
*laia (present)
*láne (past)
*alaie (perfect)
*lauva (future)
==Inspiration==
In Arabic languages, "no" is laa. J.R.R. Tolkien said himself that this negative form "appears in Wikipedia:Semitic languages".
