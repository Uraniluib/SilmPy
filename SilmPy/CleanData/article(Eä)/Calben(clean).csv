Calben (pl. Celbin) was a term used amongst Sindar that lived in Beleriand. It was used of all Elves other than Avari, and it included the Sindar. The term was thus equivalent to the Quenya word "Eldar". After the Nandor were recognized to be from Lindarin origin, they were included in Celbin. 
Since Calben was a term used only of Elves, the Edain#The Three Houses were given their own name, Edain (as they could not be called Morben, cf. this).
