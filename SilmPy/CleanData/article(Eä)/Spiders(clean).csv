Regarding the spiders in The Hobbit:


==Portrayal in adaptations==
1982: The Hobbit (1982 video game)
:In the text adventure game, spiders dont make any explicit appearance, although you will see "Pale Bulbous Eyes" as you and your party travel along the Old Forest Road. If you stay on the road for too long, something will leap down from the trees and kill you.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:See Shelob#Portrayal in adaptations
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Non-player (NPC, computer controlled) spiders are found in a number of areas of Middle-earth. Players can play a spider in the Player-versus-Player (PvP) area of the Ettenmoors once the player reaches level ten. Spiders in The Lord of the Rings Online have the ability to root and spit poison from a distance.
:The appearance of spiders vary from zone to zone for NPC spiders and from rank to rank for player controlled spiders. They all look like very large spiders from the size of a cat up to the size of a large elephant.
2012-4: The Hobbit (film series):
:The spiders of Mirkwood are portrayed in the first two films, An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug. In the former, they attack Radagasts dwelling in Rhosgobel, but are driven away by him. Radagast discovers that they came from the ruins of Dol Guldur, and deduces that they are descendants of Ungoliant. In the latter film, their role is faithful to their portrayal in the novel. As in the book, they are capable of speech (although Bilbo is only capable of understanding them while wearing the One Ring). When one of the spiders screams about how Bilbos Elvish blade "stings" it, it is then that Bilbo decides to give his weapon a name.
