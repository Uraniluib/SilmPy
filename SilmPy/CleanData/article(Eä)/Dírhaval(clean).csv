Dírhaval or Dírhavel was a Men of the House of Hador who lived among the exiles and refugees at the Havens of Sirion during the closing century of the First Age, at the time of Eärendil. 
==History==
Dírhaval was known as a poet, though he only produced a single poem. Drawing on the knowledge and memories of the people of Doriath, Dor-lómin, and other lands of Beleriand that were gathered at the Mouths of Sirion, he wrote  Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale) ("Tale of the Children of Húrin"), telling the story of Morgoths curse on Húrins children Túrin and Nienor. It was written in Sindarin, and the longest of all the lays to come out of Beleriand. 
Dírhaval did not write other poems or lays, as the Silmaril Quest for the Silmaril by Beren and Lúthien was in the keeping of Elwing. The Sons of Fëanor launched an attack on the exiles in the Havens of Sirion to claim it. Dírhaval was one of those who fell in the Third Kinslaying.
