Luinil was one of the bright stars placed in the sky by Varda at the time of the awakening of the Elves in Middle-earth.  Its identity is uncertain, though the fact that its name contains the Elvish word luin, meaning blue, does offer a clue.
The only remote explanation offered by J.R.R. Tolkien was a rough and uncertain note that seems to link Luinil to the planet we call http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune Neptune.  As Christopher Tolkien notes, though, this dark and distant object, too faint to be seen by the naked eye, would hardly qualify as a bright star., p. 435 Another alternative would be blue http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel Rigel in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion Orion, making Luinil the mate of red Borgil. Two other possibilities - based purely on the fact that they are both bright blue stars - would be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spica Spica in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo Virgo or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus Regulus in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo Leo.
