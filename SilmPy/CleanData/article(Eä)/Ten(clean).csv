__NOTOC__
TEN is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "direction"., p. 187 (root appearing as "√TEN-")
==Derivatives==
*Quenya: tenna; ten
==Other versions==
===TEƷ===
In the The Etymologies appears the root TEƷ- ("line, direction"). From this root derives:, pp. 391-2 (roots appearing as "TEƷ-" and "TEÑ"
*Primitive Quendian: teʒē
**Quenya: tië
**Noldorin: tê ("line, way")
*see TEÑ1
**Quenya: téra ("straight, right")
**Noldorin: tîr ("straight, right")
===TEÑ1 and TEÑ2===
According to Christopher Tolkien, the root TEƷ- was changed to TEÑ. In this new entry, Quenya téra and Noldorin tîr derived from Primitive Quendian teñrā, where an intermediate form appears to be tēra., pp. 17-18
There exists furthermore an additional entry on TEÑ in the Etymologies (for the sake of clarity, here called TEÑ2), yielding the derivatives Noldorin tî ("line, row"), tiwdi ("alphabet"), tær, taer ("straight"), and Quenya téma ("row, series, line"), tea ("straight line, road").
Note that there also exists a root TEÑ, with a different signification, in the manuscript "Parma Eldalamberon 17".
===√ten===
The complexity of the root TEN is has been discussed at length by Patrick H. Wynne. A very late (ca. 1968) manuscript by J.R.R. Tolkien includes an almost identical rendering of √ten as given in the version from "Parma Eldalamberon 17" (that is, the version used as the first definition in this article), which, however, was changed to a √men (yielding different derivatives). An earlier manuscript (late 1950s or early 1960s) by Tolkien also contains a mention of a √ten-, having a similar (but not identical) description., pp. 23-24 (roots appearing as "√ten" and "√ten-")
