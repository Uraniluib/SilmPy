File:Stefan Meisl - Minas Tirith.jpeg
Minas Tirith was the tower on the island of Tol Sirion that guarded the Pass of Sirion.
Minas Tirith was built around  by Finrod to prevent the forces of Morgoth from invading Beleriand from the plains of Ard-galen. After Finrod built Nargothrond he handed over control of the watchtower to his nephew, Orodreth.
In  Sauron captured Minas Tirith in the aftermath of the Dagor Bragollach and Orodreth fled south. The island was then called Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the "Isle of Werewolves".
Although the Noldor regained control of the Pass of Sirion until the Nirnaeth Arnoediad ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"), they did not attempt to rebuild the tower.
==Etymology==
Minas Tirith means "Tower of the Guard" in Sindarin (from minas = "tower, citadel" and tirith = "watch, guard").
