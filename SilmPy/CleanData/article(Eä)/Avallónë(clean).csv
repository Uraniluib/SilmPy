Avallónë was a city and seaport on the eastern shore of the island of Tol Eressëa. Its name indicated that it was the city nearest to Valinor and the tower of Avallónë was the first sight that a mariner beheld as he approached the Undying Lands. The city was described as white-shining with a great harbour with laplit quays. It had a tower where the Master-stone abode. 
 	
==History==
After the War of Wrath and the downfall of Morgoth the Valar summoned the Eldar to return to the West. Not all obeyed this new summons but those who did dwelt on Tol Eressëa.
 
In the Second Age some of the Men of Númenor, those most far-sighted, could see Avallónë from the summit of the Meneltarma or from a tall ship that lay off the western coast as far as was lawful to go. Some thought this far off vision was of Valinor itself but the wise knew it was but Avallónë. While the Númenóreans respected the Ban of the Valar many elves would sail to Númenor; they brought birds, flower, and herbs to the land.
 
The sight of Avallónë beyond their reach helped to kindle resentment in the hearts of the Númenóreans against the Ban. As the people of the island turned against the Valar the visits of the Eldar became few and only made in secret to the Faithful. By the reign of Tar-Palantir the city of Avallónë was veiled in cloud.
 
After the Downfall of Númenor, the island of Tol Eressëa with Avallónë and the Undying Lands beyond were removed from the world. Yet in the towers of the Emyn Beraid was kept the Elostirion-stone, which allowed the Elves to see the Tower of Avallónë, where the Master-stone abode.
 
==Inspiration==
In Letter to Milton Waldman, J.R.R. Tolkien states that Frodo Baggins and Bilbo Baggins were given an "Arthurian ending"., p. 132 It has been suggested by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull that Tolkien was emphasising this connection in the name Avallónë, echoing the island of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon Avalon that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur King Arthur goes to in order to recover from his wounds., 677
