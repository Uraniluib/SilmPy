Trees were the tallest of the olvar of Yavanna, plentiful throughout Middle-earth and formed :Category:Forests. Although the trees were olver, some trees were animate, like the Huorns. There was also the :Portal:Characters known as Ents, herders of the trees. 
Trees, being living things, were never regarded as gender-neutral in the Eldarin., pp. 44, 73

Trees were of special importance to Tolkien - in his short story "Leaf by Niggle", which in a sense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the protagonist, Niggle, spends his life painting a single Tree.
