Slinker was Samwise Gamgees name for the pathetic, whimpering side to Gollums personality, faithful to Frodo Baggins and desperate for his approval. Gollums Slinker persona was associated with his original life as the hobbit-like creature Sm√©agol, long ago on the banks of the Gladden River before the Ring began to twist his mind. Slinker fought a failing fight for control of Gollum against his darker, more dangerous side, Stinker. As he led Frodo and Sam into Mordor, Slinker gradually faded away, and the deadly, Ring-obsessed Stinker took over Gollum completely.
