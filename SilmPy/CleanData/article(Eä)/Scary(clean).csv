Scary was a small settlement that lay in the hilly region of caves and rock holes that formed the northern parts of the Eastfarthing, which also gave its name to the surrounding Hills of Scary.
From among the rocky lands around Scary much of the Shires stone was quarried. 
During the War of the Ring, the Scary quarries were used by Ruffians to store their loot, and after Sharkey was defeated, much of this was recovered by the Shire-hobbits.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkien notes that the name was meaningless in Hobbitish of the War of the Ring. However he notes that since it was in a rocky region and of a stone-quarry, it may be supposed to contain English dialectal scar, "rocky cliff"., p. 775
Based on the above, David Salo has suggested that Scary represents a speculative Old English *Skerig "precipitous (place)". Salo also noted that the form of this dialectal word, specifically the existence of sk-, reveals a Norse origin.
Tom Shippey suggests an etymology from Old English scearu "a boundary", marking the Shires northern boundary; the retaining (or reversal) of /sk/ might reflect the peculiarity of Wikipedia:Northern English (in such names as Wikipedia:Skipton, Wikipedia:Scarborough, North Yorkshire).Jason Fisher, ed., Tolkien and the Study of His Sources, p. 11
