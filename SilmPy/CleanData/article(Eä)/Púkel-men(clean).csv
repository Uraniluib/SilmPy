File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Púkel-man.png
Púkel-men were the ancient carved images, that lined the road to Dunharrow, the Stair of the Hold, in the White Mountains. One statue was standing in each turn of the winding road; each resembled a man with clumsy limbs, squatting cross-legged with his short arms folded across his fat belly.  
These were carved by the ancient, long-forgotten men of the Second Age, perhaps related to the Oathbreakers, who populated the White Mountains. The statues were thought to be in the likeness of Woses or Drúedain, who also had made their homes there. All had eroded over the years until some had no features except empty eye holes.  The Rohirrim ignored the statues when they passed them.
==Etymology==
The word púcel in Old English means "little goblin"., note 14 The element púc "goblin" is related to the name Wikipedia:Puck and the modern English word "pug"., Giving of Names, p. 219
