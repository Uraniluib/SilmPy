Green Hill Country was a patch of country in the Shire, marked out by the Green Hills that ran west to east through three of the Shires four Farthings.
The western feet of the Green Hills were in the Westfarthing, in the lands of the Took Family. The Hills cut through the northern corner of the Southfarthing, where the village of Pincup lay on their southern slopes. Finally, they passed through the border into the Eastfarthing, where they became densely wooded, and reached their eastern end at the appropriately named Woody End.
From Tuckborough, a road ran eastwards through the Green Hill Country, and it was this that Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee and Peregrin Took briefly used in their journey from Bag End.
