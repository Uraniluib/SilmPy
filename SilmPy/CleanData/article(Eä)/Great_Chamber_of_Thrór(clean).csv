The Great Chamber of Thrór was the hall of feasting and council in the mountain-realm of Lonely Mountain. When Thorin and Company (including Bilbo Baggins) came upon the chamber in  its great doors were half burnt and hanging twisted upon their hinges. The floor of the room was filled with rotting tables, overturned chairs and benches, flagons, bowls, broken drinking horns, skulls, and bones, all covered with dust.

The Great Chamber was probably named after Thrór after he became king in . Its ruined state testifies that it was one of the scenes of destruction during the Sack of Erebor in .
