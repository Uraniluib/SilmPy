Ambarto (pron. ) was a Quenya Amilessë given to Amras, twin son of Fëanor by Nerdanel, his mother. Initially, both twins were called Ambarussa so their father insisted on having different names. Nerdanel changed one of the names, without clearly deciding which, to Umbarto, which meant "the fated". Because of its meaning, Fëanor had quickly urged Nerdanel to change it to Ambarto. 
It is translated as "Upwards-exalted", being composed from amba = "upwards, top" and arta = "exalted"., pp. 353-354
