The house of Oromë was the dwelling of Oromë in Valinor. Few details of this house are told in the Quenta Silmarillion, except that it was visited by Celegorm, who there "got great knowledge of birds and beasts" and even learnt "all their tongues".
==Other versions==
"...his gate and tree-propped halls, the forest-god"
In early versions of the legendarium, Oromës house is also referred to as the halls of Oromë. It was located in Valmar, the city of the Valar in Valinor. The halls were "wide and low", with walls and floor abundantly adorned with "skins and pelts" and "spears and bows and knives". A tree grew in the middle of each room (where dwelt Oromës folk, clad in green and brown), holding up the roof., pp. 75-6, pp. 186 (line 892), 198
