Amon Lhaw, also called the Hill of Hearing, was one of the three peaks above the Rauros where they drained Nen Hithoel.  It towered among the Emyn Muil on the eastern banks of the Anduin. Its twin, Amon Hen (The Hill of Sight) lay upon the western bank.  Between them, at the very center of the stream above Rauros, was the island hill of Tol Brandir upon which none had ever set foot.
Though at one time Amon Lhaw had been part of the northern borderlands of Gondor and a high seat was built there (probably called the Seat of Hearing) that lay centuries in the past at the time of the War of the Ring; by then, it had long since fallen under the influence of Mordor.
When Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee left the Fellowship of the Ring they paddled across the Anduin and landed upon the southern slopes of the hill where there was a shelving shore.
