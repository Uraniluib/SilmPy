Luckwearer was one of several names and titles given to himself by Bilbo Baggins during his encounter with the dragon Smaug. Bilbo made these titles intentionally obscure and mysterious: Luckwearer is a reference to the The One Ring Bilbo wore, and his extraordinary good luck – as he thought – in finding it within the Orcs dark tunnels.
