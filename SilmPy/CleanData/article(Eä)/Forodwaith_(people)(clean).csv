The Forodwaith were an almost unknown people of Men who dwelt in the far north of Middle-earth, apparently dating back to the Elder Days. They were noted as being a hardy people, as indeed would be necessary living in the icy lands close to Morgoths stronghold at Angband. The land they lived in was also called Northern Waste, after its inhabitants.
By the Third Age, little was left of the Forodwaith. Their last remnant were a people known as the Lossoth, who lived near the Icebay of Forochel. However, the frozen north was still referred to as Forodwaith by the people of Middle-earth.
== Etymology ==
Forodwaith means "People of the North" in Sindarin (from forod = "north" and gwaith = "people").
