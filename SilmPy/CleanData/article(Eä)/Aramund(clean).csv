Aramund is an Elvish word said to mean "Kingly bull".
Helge Fauskanger includes the word in his Neo-Quenya wordlist, but notes that the form "may not be pure Quenya, because of the final consonant cluster".Helge Fauskanger, "http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)" at http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion (accessed 25 June 2011)
==Etymology==
As the Elvish element ar is said to mean "high, noble, royal",,  and an "elvish" word for "bull" is said to be mundo, it is likely that Aramund derives from these two elements (considering its given meaning, "Kingly bull").
