__NOTOC__
Kyermë means "prayer" in Quenya.
==Etymology==
The etymology is not known. The form of the word would suggest a PQ Sundocarmë *KJER and the noun ending -më.
The word is the only one in Quenya that displays the exceptional sound ky. It has been suggested that it is a Númenorean dialect of Quenya or that it is a misreading of hy (see also hyam).
In any event, traditional Quenya phonotactics forbids the existence of ky (having merged it with ty even before Rúmil (elf of Tirion) invented sarati), so even if Dúnedain used it, it is unlikely the Vanyar or Noldor ever did.
== Examples ==
*Erukyermë: "Prayer to Ilúvatar", Erukyermë
==See also==
*hyam "to pay"
