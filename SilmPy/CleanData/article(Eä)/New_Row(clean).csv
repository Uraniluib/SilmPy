The New Row was a row of hobbit-holes cut into the southern face of Hobbiton Hill after the War of the Ring. They were made to replace Bagshot Row, which had been destroyed by Ruffians.  It became a jest in Bywater to refer to New Row as "Sharkeys End", since Saruman (Sharkey) died there. 
After the restoration the Gaffer Gamgee returned to Number 3, and his son Samwise Gamgee lived with him until Sam married Rose Cotton and relocated to Bag End.
