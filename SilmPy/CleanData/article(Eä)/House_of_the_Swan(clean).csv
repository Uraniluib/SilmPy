In The Fall of Gondolin (chapter) Tuor refers to himself as belong to "the house of Swan of the men of the North". It is not stated what this refers to, but Tuors emblem is a Swans on a blue field and Ulmo sometimes uses swans to guide him on his journey to Gondolin. The House Tuor founds in Gondolin is called the "House of the Wing" and its emblem is the wing of a "swan or gull". 
It may be supposed that Peleg and Indor, Tuors father and grandfather respectively in this version of the legendarium, also belonged to the House of the Swan. Or, alternatively, Tuor may have invented it for himself.
Another explanation is given in the later manuscript Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin, where it is said that the swan was the token of Tuors foster-father Annael and his folk, who were indeed "men of the North", dwelling in Mithrim., p. 205
