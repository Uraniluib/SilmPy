In The Silmarillion, Fingolfin is given three children, but his wife is not mentioned in the genealogy.
In later name revisions, circa 1970, the name Alairë was given to the wife of Turgon, and it was later changed to Anairë. However, "the substitution of Elenwë in The Silmarillion was based on the Elvish genealogies of 1959." In that text, Anairë was defined as a Vanya who remained in the city of Tirion upon Túna, but it was later corrected to the version which had Elenwë who perished in the Ice. Anairë, which was written on the same table for the same time period as Elenwë, was noted as the wife of Fingolfin, with the note that she remained in Aman.
