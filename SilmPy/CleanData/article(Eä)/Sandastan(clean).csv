Sandastan was the Quenya word for a defensive formation used by the soldiers of the Númenórean Realms, better known by the Sindarin thangail..
==Etymology==
The final element in sandastan is derived from the stem stama- meaning bar or exclude, so the literal translation is probably shield-barrier.Ardalambion: http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist. Retrieved 2010-09-01.
