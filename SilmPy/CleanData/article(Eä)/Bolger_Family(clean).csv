The Bolger Family was a Hobbit family of Fallohides origin associated with the village of Budgeford, on The Water in the Eastfarthing of the Shire.  In common with the Brandybuck Family and the Took Family, the Bolgers had a penchant for heroic names, and so as well as Fredegar Bolger, we find such noble names as Fastolph Bolger, Gundabald Bolger and Odovacar Bolger.
==Etymology==
The name Bolger is a reference to the "bulged" size of the average Hobbit belly, referring to their fatness and tubbiness and presumably begun as a nickname.
Both Bolger and Bulger are real-life English surnames although not necessarily of the same etymology.
It was a translation of Westron Bolgra of similar meaning.
