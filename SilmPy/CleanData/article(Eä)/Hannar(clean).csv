 
Hannar was one of the four Dwarves that stayed at Bag End after Bilbo Baggins birthday party.
==Other versions==
In the early writings of the chapter "A Long-expected Party", Hannar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, J.R.R. Tolkien later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.
==Etymology==
Hanarr and Hannarr are dwarfs from the Völuspá. Both their names mean "Skilled".Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967
