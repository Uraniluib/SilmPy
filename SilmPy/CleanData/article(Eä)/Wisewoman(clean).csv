The title Wisewoman was applied to women of the Edain in the First Age who had great knowledge of the history and lore of their people. Some married, while others remained unwed. All of them passed their knowledge on to a chosen successor, as was usual among the Wise of the Edain.
Two Wisewomen are known by name: Adanel and Andreth.
