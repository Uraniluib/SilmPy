The South Road was a major road of Gondor.
A road ran from Pelargir to the north, crossed Erui at the Crossings of Erui and reached Minas Tirith through the Rammas Echor.The name "South Road" is used only by Bergil; the road that could be "the South Road" is unnamed on the map, however the context of the narrative makes this identification obvious. Cf. , p. 363
During the War of the Ring, before the Siege of Gondor, captains of the Southern Fiefs were expected along the South Road.
