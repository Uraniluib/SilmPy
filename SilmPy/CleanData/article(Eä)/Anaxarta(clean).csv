Anaxarta is a Quenya noun., pp. 340-1 
==Etymology==
The etymology of the word is not obvious. 
Arguably, it is a compound of the words *anaxara *"most rushing" (an- "most" + *axara, a possible derivative from root SKAR; cf. ascar) plus arta "exalted". The word *Anaxararta would be simplified as Anaxarta.http://www.pa2rick.com/langlab/anaxartaron.html Analysis of the phrase Anaxartaron Onyalie by Patrick H. Wynne
Other possibilities link the word to MÃ¡hanaxar, therefore being of Valarin origin. In that case it could tentatively be an epithet for the Valar who participate in the Ring of Doom.http://elfling.midgardsmal.com/index.php?topic=107104.0 Analysis by David Salo
