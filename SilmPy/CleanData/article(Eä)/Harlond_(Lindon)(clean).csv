Harlond was a haven of the Elves on the southern shores of the Gulf of Lune. It was situated in a small inlet about 150 miles south-west of Grey Havens, on the side of Harlindon. 
It is told that the fleet of EÃ¤rnur, arriving in Lindon during the Angmar War, filled the harbours of Harlond, Forlond, and the Grey Havens.
