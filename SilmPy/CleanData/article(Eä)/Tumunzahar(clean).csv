Tumunzahar is the Khuzdul name for Nogrod, the citadel of the Dwarves that lay in the central part of the Blue Mountains, near Mount Dolmed.
==Etymology==
Tumunzahar is apparently Khuzdul for "Hollowbold". (entries for Hollowbold, Nogrod)(entry for groth) Magnus Åberg has suggested that the name consists of the unattested elements tûm (?"bold/delving") and zahar (?"hollow").Magnus Åberg, "http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.pdf An analysis of Dwarvish" at http://www.forodrim.org/index_en.html Forodrim.org (accessed 5 November 2011)
