It is told that the tree culumalda, having yellow flowers, was especially abundant in Cormallen
==History==
After returning from the Battle of the Morannon, Aragorn set up his camp on the Fields of Cormallen in . There, he received Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee after their rescue from the wreckage of Mount Doom. They were greeted by many friends, and were praised in the celebration of the victory in the War of the Ring.
==Etymology==
The name Cormallen is Sindarin and means "golden circle" (from cor, "ring" and mallen "gold"). Apparently the name derived from the tree culumalda., pp. 625-6 (citing from the Unfinished index) (entry for al-)
The Gondorians likely used the name Cormalthen as in Gondor Sindarin compounds retained the wikipedia:Fricative consonant. The spelling Cormallen follows the "proper" Elvish Sindarin, malt ("gold") and ending -en became *mallen, however in Gondor this remained malthen., The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor, pages 5-31, esp. 27
