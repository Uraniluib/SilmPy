Lavaralda was a tree from Tol Eressëa brought to Númenor by the Eldar.
It had long green leaves which were golden on the undersides. Its flowers were pale with a yellow brush and a faint but clear odour that brought rest and great content. Lavaralda flowered in thick branches and it rested from flowering only at seldom and rare times., pp. 57-58
