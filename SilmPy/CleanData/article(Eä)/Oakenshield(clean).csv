Oakenshield was the title and sobriquet of King Thorin of Durins Folk.
Thorin acquired the title long before he became King. In  when he was just fifty-three (a young age for a Dwarf) he marched with a mighty Dwarf-army to the valley they called Azanulbizar, Nanduhirion beneath the Great Gates. There they fought the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last and greatest in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In that battle, Thorins shield was broken, so he cut a bough from an oak-tree with his axe, and used that instead to fend off his enemies blows, or to club them. It was that oaken branch that gave Thorin his surname, but it did not completely save him from injury - it is recorded that he was wounded in the battle.  In memory of the battle, Thorin bore a plain shield of oak wood with no device, and swore to do so until he was hailed king.
 
==Inspiration==
Like many Dwarvish names, it appears in the Norse poem Völuspá in the form Eikinskjaldi, but there it is the personal name of a Dwarf, not a surname as in Tolkiens work.
Tolkien fandom have speculated that Tolkien may possibly have been inspired by a Wikipedia:Kvæði, "Wikipedia:Regin Smiður", in which Wikipedia:Sigurd uses an oak tree branch as a weapon:
All from an ancient oaken-tree
A mighty branch he tore, and lammed those lads so lustily
That some rose up no moreE.M. Smith-Dampier (1934), Sigurd The Dragon-Slayer, A Faroese Ballad Cycle
