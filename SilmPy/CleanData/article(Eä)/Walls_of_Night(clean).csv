The Walls of the Night were the outer walls of the world beyond Ekkaia that surrounded Arda as its boundaries in the Elder Days.
In the North and South, Ekkaia was narrower and the Walls were closer to the north and south lands of Arda. 
In East and Uttermost West, Ekkaia was wider and the distance from the land was greater; the Door of Night was an opening in the west. The Gates of Morning are also mentioned, but it is not known if these were an equivalent eastern opening on the same Walls., entry "Walls of the Night"
Presumably Melkor fled through the Walls after he retreated from the First War. During the Spring of Arda, he came over the Walls of Night into the north of Middle-earth, and secretly built Utumno.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Originally, they were called the Wall of Things, and conceived as "the walls of terrestrial cities, or gardens - walls with a top: a "ring-fence". In the Ambarkanta theyre called Ilurambar, and theyre as a shell that fence Vaiya and the world from the Void that are totally impervious and their only opening is the Door of Night.
