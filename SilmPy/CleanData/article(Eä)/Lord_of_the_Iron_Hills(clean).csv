Lord of the Iron Hills was a title given to the rulers of the Iron Hills in eastern  Rhovanion. The only two known Dwarves to bear this title were Grór and his successor and grandson Dáin Ironfoot. After Dáin became Kings of Durins Folk and took up abode in Lonely Mountain, it is not know if anyone else then took up the title.
