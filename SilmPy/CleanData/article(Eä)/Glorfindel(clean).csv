Glorfindel is rarely portrayed like in the book. His role in The Lord of the Rings is too small to be introduced and forgotten - he basically does little else beyond providing fast transport to Rivendell. In the more popular works, his role has been filled by another Elf.
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:In this adaptation, the role of Glorfindel was taken by Legolas. In a simplification of that character, and as a reason for his coming, he is portrayed as an Elf of Rivendell rather than Mirkwood.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:Glorfindel appears in his original role at the Last Bridge, voiced by John Webb. Because the part of Gildor was cut, the heavily wounded Frodo says the Quenya greeting Elen síla lúmenn omientielvo to him, and Glorfindel replies with Gildors answer. Glorfindel keeps his two Sindarin lines, A na vedui, Dúnadan! and Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!, though he says them with a heavy English accent. Glorfindels role at the Council of Elrond is omitted.  His name is pronounced correctly in the adaptation, but in the credits, his name is pronounced "Glorfindle".
1988: J.R.R. Tolkiens War in Middle Earth:
:Glorfindel is a powerful playable character once the One Ring passes the Last Bridge, who leads the Fellowship to Rivendell. 
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:To limit the already large number of one-appearance characters, Glorfindel has been omitted in this adaptation as well. Peter Jackson decided to have Arwen meet the travellers and then ride on Asfaloth.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Glorfindel appears on the Last Bridge. He has several Sindarin lines: A na vedui, Dúnadan, like in the book, and Mae govannen, mellon (which Frodo accurately translates as "Well met, friend"). He comes to the aid of the hobbits at the request of Elrond, who had received news from Gildor - even though there is no mention of that group earlier in the gameplay. Glorfindel does so in a monotonous voice, and his speech continues without pause. He also uses the lines Noro lim, Asfaloth, though he does not say them to his horse: he says them to Frodo. No actor is specified for this part.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:Decipher made two The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game featuring extra Jarl Benzon as Glorfindel, one of them being at the Coronation of Elessar.  He is briefly seen in the film at Aragorns coronation when Arwen is revealed.
2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the War of the Ring. Together with Glóin of Lonely Mountain, Glorfindel fights in several places in northern Eriador and Rhovanion. He is voiced by Jason Carter, and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of Arvedui.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the Rivendell. He has long blond hair and wears a white robe with purple belt. He is involved in some of the book quests for Shadows of Angmar. The player also talks to him after defeating the balrog Thaurlach.
2012: Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game:
:Glorfindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game). Glorfindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.
