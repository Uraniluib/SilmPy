Falco Chubb-Baggins was a cousin of Bilbo Baggins, the son of Bilbos uncle Bingo Baggins and Chica Chubb.
==History==
He lived a long life, reaching the age of ninety-six, but not quite long enough to attend his cousins Bilbos Farewell Party, which was held two years after his death. He was survived by a daughter, Poppy Chubb-Baggins, but when she married Filibert Bolger the short-lived Chubb-Baggins Family line came to an end.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2003: The Hobbit (2003 video game):
:Five portraits are clustered on a wall in Bag End. One of them is Falco, and one of Bilbos lines when looking at the portraits is "Ah, Cousin Falco!".
