Olvar was Yavannas word for the plants and plant-life in her care. Unlike the kelvar, they are inanimate. Trees are the highest of
the olvar.
After her husband Aulë created the Fathers of the Dwarves, she became concerned for the fate of both the kelvar (animals) and olvar (plants) at the hands of their descendants. She spoke of her fears to Manwë, who revealed that Ilúvatar intended that spirits should be sent to dwell among some of the olvar and protect them. This was the ultimate origin of the beings who came to be known as Ents.
==Etymology==
Olvar is Quenya, glossed as "growing things with roots in the earth". 
There is a similarity to other relevant words (perhaps variants) such as olwa, entry GÓLOB and olba, p.340 which are however glossed as "branch".
In The Etymologies, olwa is derived from the root GÓLOB.
