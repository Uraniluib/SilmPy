Gongs are evil beings that appear in The Book of Lost Tales, the earliest version of what would become The Silmarillion. In his commentary, Christopher Tolkien remarks that they are obscurely related to Orcs, perhaps as a sub-race of the species. There are no references to Gongs in J.R.R. Tolkiens later legendarium and the author appears to have abandoned the concept.
The Gnomish word sithagong is glossed as "dragonfly" (sitha being the word for flies)., p. 68
