The Hill Road was a road in the Shire which led from Hobbiton to Overhill, and went over the Hill past Bag End.  On the evening of 23 September  Frodo Baggins walked partly down Hill Road in anxious expectation of Gandalfs arrival.  While there he heard the old Gaffer talking to some stranger with an unpleasant voice, just around the corner on Bagshot Row.
