==History==
File:Liz Danforth - Morgul-knife.jpg
At Weathertop, during his journey to Rivendell with the One Ring,  the Hobbits Frodo Baggins was stabbed by the Witch-king. A fragment of the blade remained within the wound, working its way toward his heart and threatening to turn Frodo into a Wraiths. Elrond was able to remove the shard and heal the wound, but each year on the anniversary of his stabbing Frodo became seriously ill. Only his eventual departure to Eldamar offered a permanent cure.
Athelas (or Kingsfoil) was known to slow the poisonous effect of the morgul-blade. This treatment was also effective against other Mordor illnesses, such as the Black Breath.
