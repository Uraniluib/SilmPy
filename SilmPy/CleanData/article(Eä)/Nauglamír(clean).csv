The Nauglamír or Necklace of the Dwarves was a famed piece of jewellery; combined with the craft of Dwarves and gems from Valinor it was of great grace and beauty which it gave to its wearer. Despite being loaded with gems, it sat lightly on the neck.
It bore the Silmaril rescued by Beren from the Iron Crown, and it became jewellery more beautiful than anything ever before seen in Arda. But because of the Silmaril it was coveted by the Sons of Fëanor and entangled in the Doom of the Noldor. 
==History==
The Nauglamír was made for Finrod by Dwarves of the Ered Luin and was the most renowned of their works in that age. They fastened on it gems that Finrod brought from Valinor. It was his most prized treasure in Nargothrond and the most famed Dwarven work of the Elder Days.
During and after the Fall of Nargothrond the Nauglamír remained therefore forgotten in the hoard of Glaurung. Húrin found it and brought the famous treasure to the Kingdom of Doriath, and threw it on the floor, bitterly "thanking" Thingol for fostering Turin Turambar and Morwen. When Húrin left, Dwarves of Nogrod had been invited to Menegroth by Thingol and decided to refashion it and fasten the Silmaril of Lúthien and Beren on it.

The Dwarves were enthralled by its gems and of course the Silmaril, and demanded it from Thingol, claiming it as just payment for their labours. Thingol realized that they wished to possess the Silmaril, and sent them from Doriath without any payment, an event which led directly to his murder. The Dwarves fled, only to be slaughtered by the avenging Elves who killed all but two and returned the Nauglamír to Doriath. However a great host from Nogrod, roused to war, and begun the Battle of the Thousand Caves, stealing the entire treasure of Doriath including the Nauglamír. But they were waylaid by Beren Erchamion at Sarn Athrad. The Dwarves were all Battle of Sarn Athrad, and the treasure was cast into the Ascar, except for the Nauglamír, which Beren took to Lúthien. 
Lúthien wore the Nauglamír for the rest of her life, their combining beauty being the fairest beauty east of Valinor. At her second death, a Lord of the Green-elves brought it to her son, Dior, back to Doriath; but when the Sons of Fëanor heard about its whereabouts, they attacked Doriath in an attempt to claim the Silmaril in the Second Kinslaying where Dior was killed. This attempt failed, as Diors daughter Elwing fled to the Havens of Sirion saving the Nauglamír.
The Sons of Fëanor were still after the Silmaril, and attacked the Mouths of Sirion, resulting in the Third Kinslaying. Elwing cast herself into the sea with it. It is not known what happened to the Nauglamír, but Elwing and the Silmaril were saved by Ulmo who brought her in the hands of Eärendil; it was its light that guided him through the Shadowy Seas and he found his way to Valinor. The Valar then set this Silmaril as a Star and worn on his brow.
==Etymology and Names==
In the The Etymologies the word nauglamîr is listed as Doriathrin,, p. 373 (root MIR) while the true Noldorin idiom is said to be Mîr Na (Sindarin) naug or Nauglvir (-> Nauglavir)., p. 375 (note that Christopher Tolkien uses the capitalized form of Mîr in the Index; cf. p. 442)s 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In The Book of Lost Tales Part Two, the Nauglamír, then called Nauglafring, is more important: it more directly causes the death of Thingol as it gets caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the Girdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves. Thingol, unhorsed, is slain, after which Melians protection is lifted and Doriath is sacked.
The old form of the Nauglamír, the Nauglafring is in Goldogrin. The first element is naugl-, "dwarf", and the second element is fring, "carcanet, necklace".
