Badger-brock was an individual of the Badger-folk, mentioned only in Hobbits verse. He had a "snowy forehead" and "dark blinking eyes", and lived with his wife and many sons in a secret house near the Withywindle. On one occasion, Badger-brock caught and pulled down Tom Bombadil to the burrows of the Badger-folk under earth. But Tom displayed his power using chant, which caused all the Badger-folk to become frightened, and they showed him out again.
