Orod-na-Thôn ("Pine-mountain"J.R.R. Tolkien, "Unfinished index", in , p. 384. or "Mount of the Pine Tree(s)"J.R.R. Tolkien, "Eldarin Roots and Stems", in Parma Eldalamberon 17 (edited by Christopher Gilson), 2007, p. 147, entry √ANA/NĀ.) was a mountain in Dorthonion. It is mentioned by Treebeard in his song In The Willow-meads Of Tasarinan:
:Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon Orod-na-Thôn!
It has also been assumed that Orod-na-Thôn is a synonym for Dorthonion Land of Pines,See e.g. , p. 92, entry Dorthonion; p. 307, entry Orod-na-Thôn. but Tolkien states clearly in his unfinished index of place-names occurring in The Lord of the Rings that it is a separate mountain in this region.
