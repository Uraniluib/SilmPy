There were fountains before the doors, and two trees, Glingal and Belthil, of gold and silver.  The fountains shot twenty-seven fathoms into the air, and white birds dwelt in the trees, singing beautiful songs.  The tower of the palace was the tallest in the city, and the palace behind was white and beautiful., passim
