Hísilómë was a cold, mist-laden land that lay to the north of Beleriand, walled by mountains to the west, east and south. When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, this region fell under the control of Fingolfin and Fingon, and they gave it a name in their Quenya tongue: Hísilómë, "Land of Mist". As Quenya gave way to Sindarin, the name came to be replaced by its Sindarin equivalent in common use. So, this land is better known to history in its Sindarin form: Hithlum.
