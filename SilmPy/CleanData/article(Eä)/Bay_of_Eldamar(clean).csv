The Bay of Eldamar was a wide bay in the coasts of Aman, on the western shores of the Belegaer. It was here that the island of Tol Eressëa finally came to be anchored, and for many years the Teleri dwelt on that island. Eventually, Ossë guided them across the windless surface of the Bay to its shore, where they dwelt in the haven of Alqualondë.
The Bay of Eldamar was visited long afterwards by one possessing (some) mortal blood, none other than Eärendil the Mariner. He anchored Vingilot his ship in the Bay while he entered the Aman on his embassy to the Powers who dwelt there.

The Bay of Eldamar is referenced in Tolkiens Roverandom. In the story, written down in 1927, the great whale Uin takes the enchanted dog Rover (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the Shadowy Seas to the "Bay of Fairyland" beyond the Enchanted Isles where Rover saw the Pelóri and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of Tirion., pp. 73-4
