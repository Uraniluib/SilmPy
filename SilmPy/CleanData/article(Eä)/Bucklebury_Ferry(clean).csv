File:Mariët Theune - The Brandywine ferry.jpgBucklebury Ferry was a raft-ferry at the main crossing point of the River Baranduin from the Shire to Buckland, about 20 miles south of the Brandywine Bridge. From the Causeway on the west bank a lane about a hundred yards long led to a broad wooden landing-stage.  On the east side the bank was steep and a winding lane climbed up from the landing.  The ferry-boat itself was large and flat.
