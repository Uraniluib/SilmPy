__NOTOC__
The Morthond (Sindarin "Black root") was one of the seven rivers of Gondor. It arose in the White Mountains in a narrow valley that led to the southern entrance of the Paths of the Dead. The river flowed south-west for half its length and then turned south-east before joining the Ringló near Cobas Haven., West, p. 434
==History==
Near the confluence of the Morthond and the Ringló was the ancient Elf-haven of Edhellond. This refuge had been founded at the beginning of the Second Age by a remnant of Elves from Doriath., Amroth and Nimrodel
At the time of the War of the Ring the lord of the Blackroot Vale was Duinhir. He and his two sons, Duilin (son of Duinhir) and Derufin, marched to Minas Tirith with five hundred bowmen to aid in the citys defence. On 8 March  Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, the Grey Company, and the Oathbreakers exited from the Paths of the Dead alongside the Morthond. They followed the young river before crossing a bridge on their way to the Stone of Erech.
==Etymology==
Morthond is a Sindarin name meaning "black-root"., Morthond The first element mor means "dark" or "black"., mor The second element thond means "root"., p. 96
==Other versions of the legendarium==
The course and placement of the Morthond changed greatly during the writing of The Lord of the Rings. In the First Map of Middle-earth the Morthond was separate from and far west of the Ringló (with Dol Amroth far to the west of the Morthond). When J.R.R. Tolkien developed Outline VI for Book V in The Return of the King he drew a map with the Morthond east of the Ringló and the Morthond joined the Anduin near its mouth. When Tolkien made the detailed Second Map there were four rivers – Calenhir, Morthond, Kiril, and Ringló – that flowed independently until they all combined just before exiting into Cobas Haven.
