The Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were the first of their race.
The Valar Aulë created the Dwarves because he was impatient for the arising of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men) and he wished for children to love and instruct. It was the period known as the Sleep of Yavanna when Middle-earth was dark and silent and was roamed by monsters from Utumno. For this, Aule made them strong and resistant and able to endure hardships; but as he had only a vague impression of the Children of Ilúvatar, his creations were structured differently, shorter and stunted.
He created seven Dwarves, and was teaching them the language he had devised for them (Khuzdul), but Aulë was not Ilúvatar who had the Flame Imperishable and his children were dumb, able to move and speak only if he wished so, and would remain motionless whenever Aule would think elsewhere.

Ilúvatar confronted him for his impatience. Aulë offered his creations to Ilúvatar and was ready to break them in repentance. But Ilúvatar accepted his offer and gave them life of their own, and the Dwarves started cowering and pleading for mercy despite Aules will.
However, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the Elves first arrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in Middle-earth. The eldest of all, Durin, "lay alone" at Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains. He later founded the line of the Durins Folk (or Sigin-tarâg in Khuzdul), the Dwarves which were most friendly to the Elves and Men, mostly referred to as Durins Folk. His city was Moria.
Two others were laid to rest near Mount Dolmed in the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains, and they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who later lived in Nogrod and Belegost. The other four Fathers of the Dwarves were laid to rest in two pairs in lands at least as far east of Mount Gundabad as it lay east of the Blue Mountains. They founded the lines of the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots.
It was said that the Seven Fathers would be reincarnated after generations among their own folk. Durin for example was said to be reincarnated Durin (disambiguation).
Of the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have "lain alone". This can be interpreted as referring to the fact he was indeed laid down to rest alone while the other Fathers were laid to rest in pairs, but older versions of the story suggest that it meant Durin alone had no female companion. The other Fathers did: references are made by Tolkien to the "Thirteen Dwarves" created by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs)., Note 24
==Inspiration==
According to the Tolkien Encyclopedia, Aulës creation of the Dwarves is  sub-creation which aims to honor the wider Creation of God/Eru, a concept expressed in Mythopoeia; "and may indicate anxieties about the independent value of art."Michael D.C.
