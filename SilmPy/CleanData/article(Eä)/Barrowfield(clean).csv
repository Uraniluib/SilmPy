The Barrowfield was a field outside the wall and dike of Edoras where the Kings of Rohan were buried. By the end of the Third Age there were two rows of tombs: one for the First Line (Eorl to Helm) and one for the Second Line (Fréaláf to Théoden). The main road leading to the city passed between these two rows.
Simbelmynë grew on the western side of the mounds, and more thickly on Helms.
It is not known if the Kings of the Third Line (starting with Éomer) were still buried there during the Fourth Age.
