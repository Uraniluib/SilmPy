Tauremorna is one of the names of the Fangorn Forest, used by Treebeard in his song In The Willow-meads Of Tasarinan. The other names mentioned by Treebeard are Ambaróna and Aldalómë.
J.R.R. Tolkien notes in his Index questions that tauremorna means "black forest",, p. 385 likely composed of Quenya taure ("forest") + morna ("dark, black").
