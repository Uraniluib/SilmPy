==Daur in the Song of Praise== 
The Sindarin word Daur appears in the song of praise of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee at the Field of Cormallen., p. 308
It has been suggested that daur is the lenition form of taur#Noldorin ("lofty, noble" or "king"),Didier Willis, http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókës Sindarin Dictionary at http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com (accessed 19 June 2011)Helge Fauskanger, http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin, the Noble Tongue: I. Soft Mutation at Ardalambion (accessed 9 July 2011), however the reliability of this speculation has been contested as the syntax of the phrase does not seem to require lenition.Alfred W. Tueting, "http://www.fa-kuan.muc.de/SINDARIN.RXML Some Questions on Sindarin Lenition" (accessed 9 July 2011)
When analyzing the song of praise, Tolkien derived Daur from dāra "wise" with a Quenya form tāra. This replaces an earlier version from ndāra with Quenya nāra. He also queried the possibility of daur coming from lenition of base t., p. 102
