gar is a Noldorin word of uncertain meaning.
The word appears in two places:
#in a phrase on a draft of Thrórs Map: "Lheben tâl brand (word)#Noldorin i annon ar nêl neledhi gar godrebh", pp. 92, 150 (note 6)
#in an Elvish poem published in The Monsters and the Critics: "... Damrod dir hanach dalath benn gar meilien ...", p. 217
David Kiltz has suggested that gar likely means "to go", or something similar.David Kiltz, http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lambengolmor/message/512 Noldorin _gar_ (message 512) (dated 30 October 2003) at Elfling Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull also appear to translate gar as "go" in their translation of the phrase on the draft of Thrórs Map.
