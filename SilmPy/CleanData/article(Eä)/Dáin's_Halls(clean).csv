Dáins halls was a name used for the halls that formed the capital of the Grey Mountains, the name coming from the Dwarves-king Dáin I.
==History==
The Halls of Dáin were probably originally founded by the first exiled dwarves from Moria who had fled the city because of the Balrogs. However because there is no information on the halls, it can only be assumed that it was the capital of Durins folk at the time.
In  Dáin was killed by a great Cold-drakes along with his son Frór at the entrance to the city. A year later, most of Durins Folk abandoned the mountains, and left for Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills.
It is possible that either under Dáin Ironfoot or Thorin Stonehelm reign that this city was retaken.
