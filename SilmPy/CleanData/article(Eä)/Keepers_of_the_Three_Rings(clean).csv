The Keepers of the Three Rings were those who held the Three Rings of the Elves after their making, through more than 4,000 years of the Second Age and Third Age Ages.  Originally the three Keepers were Gil-galad, Galadriel, and Círdan.  Gil-galad gave his Ring to Elrond and Círdan gave his to Gandalf.  At the end of the Third Age, when the Rings of Power finally lost their power and were taken into Aman, the Keepers were Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf., 29 September
