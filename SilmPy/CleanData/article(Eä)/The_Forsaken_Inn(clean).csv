The Forsaken Inn appears to have been the easternmost outpost of the Bree-land. Situated along the Great East Road, it was, according to Aragorn, "a days ride east of Bree" and he doubted "if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn".
It is possible that it was abandoned or ruined by  as it is said that Thorin and Company on the quest to Lonely Mountain found a deserted building where they camped.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Around 1960 J.R.R. Tolkien embarked on a detailed revision of The Hobbit, with a goal of reconciling it with The Lord of the Rings., The 1960 Hobbit, p. 765  In the retelling, the sketchy details of the trip from Bag End to Rivendell were filled in and made to fit the geography of the later story.  After Thorins company left Bree, a days journey brought them to the Last Inn, which they found deserted., The Broken Bridge, p. 792  There they camped on 3 May , being too depressed to proceed further than the twenty miles they had progressed., Timelines and Itinerary, p. 816  John Rateliff (author of The History of The Hobbit) states that the Last Inn (later called the Forsaken Inn) was brought in to emphasize the desolation which had grown east of Bree., Timelines and Itinerary, p. 814
The Treason of Isengard included the first map of The Lord of the Rings.  On Map II, in the square K-8, there is a dot with the initials "F.I." on the road east of Bree about one-quarter of the distance to Weathertop.  Christopher Tolkien stated that these initials did stand for the Forsaken Inn.

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:In this adaptation, the role of the inn is greatly expanded. It is the Lone-lands settlement closest to Bree-land and lies in the shadow of Weathertop. A respite for travelers, the Inn has a milestone, mail service, and many merchants, in addition to a great number of people in need of travellers assistance. These include the Inns proprietor, Anlaf, and his staff as well as travellers, guests, and some of the Eglain that have recently been displaced from Minas Eriol.
:To the north and northeast lie the ruins of the fortifications of the war between Arthedain and Rhudaur, now occupied and spanned by camps of orcs and goblins. Ruins also lie to the south-east, and along both sides of the road to the East. A long journey across the Lone-lands in that direction eventually leads to Ost Guruth, the last settlement before the Hoarwell, which marks the borders of the Trollshaws.
