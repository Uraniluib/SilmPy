Waymeet or Waymoot was a town in the Westfarthing of the Shire.  The East Road, the main road through the Shire, ran through the town on its way to Michel Delving.  Two smaller roads also led to Waymeet: one from Little Delving to the north and one from Tookland and the Southfarthing beyond.  Where these roadways came together, a town had grown up, appropriately known as Waymeet.
==History==
In the War of the Ring, the ruffians who took over the Shire had a staging post or barracks in Waymeet, and it was from here that Sharkeys Men set out for the Battle of Bywater, in which they were soundly defeated by the Shire-hobbits. 
==Etymology==
The name refers to the village being at the meeting of three ways., p. 778 
The name Waymeet is a modernised spelling of the older form, Waymoot, which was the spelling preferred by J.R.R. Tolkien in early drafts of The Return of the King. Though he ultimately modernised the name within the book itself, the map of the Shire in the prologue of The Fellowship of the Ring  was never corrected, and still carries the older spelling of the name.Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 660
