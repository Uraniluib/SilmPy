Parth Galen was a green lawn above the Rauros at the feet of Amon Hen. Parth Galen was on the western shore of Nen Hithoel near the southern end. It was a fair, green sward and its grass was watered by a small spring.
==History==
On 25 February, , the Fellowship of the Ring landed and camped at Parth Galen.  The next day saw the breaking of the Fellowship.  Frodo Baggins asked for an hour to be alone to decide what to do and left Parth Galen to wander in the woods.  Boromir slipped away, following Frodo to persuade him to go to Minas Tirith and then attempted to seize the One Ring.  The others did not notice Boromirs absence until it was too late; when Boromir returned to Parth Galen and admitted that he had seen Frodo vanish a sense of panic fell upon the company.  Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took ran off to find him, followed by Legolas and Gimli.  Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and guard Merry and Pippin while Aragorn pursued Sam.
Aragorn overtook Sam and told him to follow, but the Ranger soon outdistanced the small hobbit.  Sam stopped to think and realized that Frodo had decided to head East by himself.  Figuring that Frodo would need gear Sam correctly reckoned that Frodo would return to Parth Galen for supplies.  Sam raced to the lawn and saw a boat launching itself.  Charging into the water, Sam had to be saved by Frodo who drew him into his boat.  Frodo then agreed that Sam could come with him and allowed his servant to retrieve his own gear.  They then left Parth Galen to head for Emyn Muil. 
In the meantime, Merry and Pippin were captured by a group of Uruk-hai and orcs, after Boromir had died defending them.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli brought Boromirs body to Parth Galen where they placed it in a boat with the Great Horn, his sword and the weapons of his slain enemies.  They then set the boat adrift on the lake of Nen Hithoel and it vanished over the Rauros.  The three companions then left Parth Galen in pursuit of Merry and Pippin.
