Phantoms was a name commonly used to describe evil, shadowy beings, such as undead, demons or delusions., passim, passim
==History and characteristics==
In the Elder Days, creatures of "dreadful shapes", among whom are said to have been phantoms, haunted the Elves, dragging people into the darkness surrounding the borders of the Elven dwellings never to reappear., p. 416
In Beleriand, the forest of Taur-nu-Fuin was an infamous locale of "phantoms of terror" said to strangle or pursue lost wanderers.
Using wizardry, it was possible to summon phantoms of delusion. Sauron, "master of shadows and of phantoms", devised a phantom resembling Eilinel to entrap Gorlim. In the late Third Age, Saruman was rumoured to also be able to craft such phantoms.
It is also told that disembodied, "phantom-like" Elf-souls (from Elves "who had been slain in the course of some wrong-doing") could maliciously appear before living beings to induce fear, being envious of people still alive., p. 179
Beings called phantoms also appear in the poem Oilima Markirya., p. 11, (HarperCollins 2006, p. 223)
==Etymology==
Phantom (from Middle English and Old French fantosme, from Latin phantasma), means "specter, spirit, ghost" or "illusion, unreality".http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phantom "phantom" at http://dictionary.com Dictionary.com Unabridged. (accessed 26 December 2010)
The Quenya word fairë is glossed as "phantom; disembodied spirit, when seen as a pale shape" (pl. fairi). The Black Speech word gûl is glossed (among other things) as "phantom"., p. 79 The Qenya form qímar ("phantom"; qímari "phantoms") has been suggested as a reconstructed form deriving from linguistic material., p. 82Based on the etymology of qímari, linguists have suggested that Tolkien intended (in this stage of the legendarium) that a phantom was a "awake...but not...living" hence "a mind or spirit that is incorporeal or disembodied" (, p. 82). 
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a "hastily written manuscript on small slips of paper, entitled ‘Reincarnation of Elves’",, p. 363 J.R.R. Tolkien discussed different possibilities of how the houseless Fëar of an Elves can have a "memory so strong that it can in another fëa (incarnate) induce a picture of it, so that it seems a phantom form". Such a phantom "cannot be touched, but can be walked through"., pp. 146, 148 
==Portrayal in adaptations==
