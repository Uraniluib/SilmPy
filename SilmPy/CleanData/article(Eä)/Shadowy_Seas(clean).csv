The Shadowy Seas were that part of the Belegaer that lay closest to the shores of the Aman, to the immediate east of Tol Eressëa and the Bay of Eldamar. After the Exile of the Noldor and the first rising of the Moon, the Valar elected to shield their realm from the outside world. They enmeshed these seas with a bewildering shadow - the source of their name - and created a chain of Enchanted Isles, each of which had the power to ensnare any mariner braving this region. Throughout the centuries that followed, no ship reached the shores of Aman, until Eärendil finally succeeded in passing through the shadows of the Shadowy Seas.
