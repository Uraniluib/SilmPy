Arktik (or Arctic) was the language spoken by the folk of the North Pole: the Red Elves, the Polar Bear, and others.
A sample of Arktik is seen in one of the letters: Mára mesta an ni véla tye ento, ya rato nea which translates as "Good-bye until I see you next, and I hope it will be soon."
==Inspiration==
Although the Letters from Father Christmas are not part of the legendarium, the known sample of Arktik written by Tolkien is actually Qenya, which he had developed by then.
