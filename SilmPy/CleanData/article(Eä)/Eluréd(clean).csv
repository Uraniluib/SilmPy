Eluréd ( – ) was a son of Dior and Nimloth of Doriath.  He had a twin brother named Elurín and a sister Elwing, and all three had been born in Lanthir Lamath while Beren and Lúthien lived there.  However, after the host of the Naugrim had plundered Menegroth, Dior brought his family to the Thousand Caves to renew the kingdom of Doriath.
But soon, after not many years had passed, a messenger brought the Nauglamír to Dior, which told him that Beren and Lúthien were gone from the world.  The news that Necklace of the Dwarves, which bore one of the Silmarils, was in Diors keeping provoked the sons of Fëanor to attack Menegroth.  Dior and Nimloth were slain and Eluréd and Elurín were captured (Elwing escaped with the Silmaril).  The two young boys were taken into the woods by the servants of Celegorm and left to starve.  Maedhros repented and sought for the two but never found them.
==Etymology==
The Sindarin name is said to mean the same as the boys fathers name, Eluchíl, that is, "Heir of Elu".
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an early stage, Eluréd was called "Elbereth", an Ilkorin name containing the word bereth "valor". During the writing of The Lord of the Rings, the name was applied to Varda, and the original meaningThus probably envisioned as *"star-valor" was struck out and the character was renamed "Eldún"., entries BARATH, BER
In the genealogical table of the House of Bëor, "Eldún"s date of birth was given as  492 (and he was not a twin).  He and his brother did die in  but their father died in .  In commentary following the table, Christopher Tolkien explained the year of 511 for Diors death was incorrect and that in later sources the two brothers were twins born in ., (i) The House of Bëor
