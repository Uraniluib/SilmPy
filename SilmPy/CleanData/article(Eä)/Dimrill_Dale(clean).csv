Dimrill Dale (Nanduhirion in Sindarin and Azanulbizar in Khuzdul) was a valley on the east side of the Misty Mountains, beneath the Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol peaks. It was the eastern end of Redhorn Pass and was bordered by the Dimrill Stair. Dimrill Dale was the source of the Celebrant river. At its southeast corner was Mirrormere, a sacred lake to the Dwarves of Durins Folk.
During the Years of the Trees, Durin wandered south to Dimrill Dale and founded the Kingdom of Moria beneath the surrounding mountains. Thousands of years later, after Orcs had turned the Dwarven city into the "Black Pit" of Moria, the climactic battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs was fought here. The Battle of Azanulbizar, which occurred in , ended as a defeat of the Orcs and their leader Azog. The Dwarves, though, were unable to take back Moria because of the Durins Bane that still dwelt there.
The Fellowship of the Ring briefly rested in Dimrill Dale after escaping from Moria, following the loss of Gandalf.
==Etymology==
The name Dimrill means "overshadowed rills" referring to the rills that ran down the mountain-side.
