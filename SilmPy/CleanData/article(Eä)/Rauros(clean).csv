Rauros, the Falls of Rauros or the Rauros-falls, were the great falls of River Anduin beneath Nen Hithoel, where the river fell from Emyn Muil to the wetland of Nindalf.
==History==
The Kings of Gondor had built the North Stair, a portage-way that bypassed the Falls.
At the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee paddled a boat from the west bank of the river to the east just above the falls and had to use all their strength to avoid being swept over the falls by the current. Shortly afterwards Boromirs body was placed in another boat by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli who sent it over the Falls. Aragorn declared in the Lament for Boromir that ever after the Tower of Guard would gaze "to Rauros, golden Rauros falls until the end of days".
But it apparently survived the fall; at any rate, soon afterwards it was seen by his brother Faramir upon the lower reaches of the Anduin in what felt to him like a dream yet from which there was no waking, and he retrieved Boromirs cloven horn in truth and not in seeming.
==Etymology==
In his unfinished index, J.R.R. Tolkien glossed the name Rauros as "roaring spray"., p. 327 A pencilled annotation in a manuscript also gives the translation "Rush-rain" or "Roar-rain"., p. 285
In another manuscript, the name Rauros(se) is said to be composed of raw and ros, and meaning "roaring rain". It is noted that the repetition of r in a name is usually retained in those with "phonetic or onomatopoeic significance"., p. 99
