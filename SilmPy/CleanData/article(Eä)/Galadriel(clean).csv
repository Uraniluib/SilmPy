1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Galadriel is voiced by Annette Crosbie.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by Marian Diamond. In addition to the Lothlórien episodes, the voice of Galadriel is heard in Shelobs Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Elrond in the final episode in the Shire, as they journey towards the Grey Havens.
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Galadriel is played by Cate Blanchett. Galadriel narrates the Prologue, explaining the creation of the Rings of Power and the War of the Last Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events. 
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Galadriel, voiced by Jennifer Hale, is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:Galadriel frequently consults telepathically with Elrond; there is an indication from the books that the two were able to communicate in some way, without specific reference. In the film, unlike the book, Galadriel and Elrond send an army of Elves - led by Haldir - to Battle of the Hornburg to aid the Rohirrim. In the DVD commentary, Peter Jackson and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves dont seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screentime and resources.  
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelobs Lair, soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him.  She is later seen leaving Middle-Earth along with other Ring-Bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.
2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:Galadriel is the strongest of "Hero" units available to the Free Peoples. If a players army manages to spot Gollum on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to "summon" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring movie.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Galadriel is a non-playable character, who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the second Volume of the Epic story. Introduced in The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria Book VI: The Shadowy Abyss, she usually resides on a talan at Caras Galadhon.
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel, although the character itself is absent from the novel. She appears as part of the White Council alongside Saruman, Gandalf and Elrond. Later, she telepathically urges Gandalf to further seek the true identity of the Sauron#Saurons Return. Finally, during the attack on Dol Guldur, Galadriel plays a larger role. She first rescues Gandalf from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Sauron from the fortress using her Phial of Galadriel.
2014: Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor:
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character.
