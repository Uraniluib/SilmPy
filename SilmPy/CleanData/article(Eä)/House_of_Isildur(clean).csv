The House of Isildur were the descendants of Isildur, elder son of Elendil. The House came close to destruction at the beginning of the Third Age, when Isildur and his three eldest sons were lost at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. His youngest son Valandil (King of Arnor) was kept safe in Rivendell, however, and from him came the line of the Kings of Arnor that led over three thousand years to Aragorn.

===The Realm of Arnor===
Elendil and his two sons, Isildur and Anárion founded the two Númenóreans realms in exile: Arnor and Gondor.  Elendil was the High King of all of the Dúnedain but the rule of the southern kingdom of Gondor was delegated to joint ruled under his sons.  After the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men both Elendil and Anárion were dead, so Isildur became the new High King.  When he left Gondor to take up his kingship in Arnor he delegated rule of Gondor to Anárion’s son, Meneldil.  However, Isildur and his first three sons perished in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields.  From that time forward the two realms were sundered, with the Kings of Gondor descending from the House of Anárion and the Kings of Arnor descending from the House of Isildur.

===The Realm of Arthedain===
Due to dissention among the sons of King Eärendur, the realm of Arnor was divided in three.  The eldest son, Amlaith, became the first King of Arthedain and his descendants maintained the line of Isildur while that line died out in the other two kingdoms.

===The Chieftains of the Dúnedain===
After the destruction of Arthedain by the attacks of Angmar the heirs of Isildur ceased to be kings.  Instead, they continued as chieftains of the remnant of the northern Dúnedain until Aragorn II was crowned as Aragorn of the Reunited Kingdom.
