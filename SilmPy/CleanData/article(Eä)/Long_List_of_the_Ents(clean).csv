The Long List of the Ents was a song of lore known to the Ents that listed every living creature known to them.
On 29 February , Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took met Treebeard in Fangorn Forest.  Puzzled to meet creatures he had never seen before, Treebeard began reciting the list to see if he could recall where the two Hobbits might fit in, but decided that they were indeed missing.

the wide-walkers, water drinking;
and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children,
the laughing-folk, the little people,
