 
Dark Tree is an abstract term used by J.R.R. Tolkien in his fragment of a story "The New Shadow", (Part IV of The Peoples of Middle-earth).
Dark Tree is a description of the growing threat of evil in Middle-earth - its roots can never be fully destroyed so that evil will once again arise if the tree is left untended or unwatched. The term is used by Borlas in the The New Shadow in his conversation with Saelon.
