Almaida was a shoreland town that apparently lay on the Bay of Andúnië in the northwestern region of Númenor known as the Andustar. It seems to have been built a little further westward along the bay than the main city of Andúnië itself, but little more can be said of Almaida. 
==Etymology==
The name is only known from a single Númenórë (map)‎, where it is unintelligible, and is never mentioned elsewhere. The name is apparently Quenya but also it is incompatible with Quenya phonology as the sound d does not occur in Quenya names outside "nd", "rd" and "ld".A similar problem is seen with the word Aldudénië from the Silmarillion. It has been suggested that the actual word was misread by Christopher Tolkien.
