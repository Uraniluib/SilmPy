:Perhaps the oldest of the 13 Dwarves (next to Balin), Óin is also hard of hearing, as he carries an ear trumpet (which got trodden on by a Orcs in Goblin-town when the company was captured, though he mostly manages to bend it back into its original shape after their escape).  Because of the fact that he was the groups de facto medicine man (and also presumably due to his older age), he opts to stay behind in Lake-town (along with Fíli) to look after Kíli when Thorin deems him too ill (from having been struck by a poisoned arrow) to accompany the group on the final leg of their quest up to the Lonely Mountain.  He is in awe of Tauriels Elvish healing powers when she ultimately heals Kílis wound.
