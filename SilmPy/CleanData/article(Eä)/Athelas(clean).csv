Athelas, also known as Kingsfoil or asëa aranion ("Beneficial of Kings"), was a sweet-smelling herb with healing powers, such as curing wounds, poison and counteracting evil influence such as the Black Breath. 
==History==
During the First Age athelas was perhaps growing in Beleriand. Huan had found athelas to heal Beren of his wounds.
Athelas most notably grew on the island of Númenor and was brought to Middle-earth by Númenóreans. It grew sparsely in Eriador and only in places where the Men of Westernesse had camped or lived, but by the end of the Third Age only the Rangers of the North retained the knowledge of its healing properties. 
In Gondor (where it was known as Kingsfoil) its healing virtues were unknown and its leaves were esteemed only for their refreshing scent but it was especially powerful in the hands of the Kings of Gondor, perhaps because of the Elves heritage of the House of Anarion.
It was used by Aragorn on several occasions: healing Frodo Baggins from the Morgul wound, tend the wounds of Frodo and Sam after the exit from Moria, and, secretly entering Minas Tirith upon his return to Gondor, to heal those touched by the Black Breath, an act that enhanced his reputation and strengthened his claim to the crown.
==Properties and Effects==

Athelas, when dried and crushed in hot water, is refreshing, clears, calms the minds and strengthens those smelling the scent. It also has a particular scent that is particular to individual who smells the herb:
* Faramirs scent is of "dewy mornings of unshadowed sun... in which Spring is itself but a fleeting memory"
* Ioreth smells "roses of Imloth Melui" of her childhood
* Éowyn smells no scent as if the air was clean, fresh and had never "been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam."
* Meriadoc Brandybucks smell is that of "orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees"
==Etymology==
Athelas is a Sindarin word, consisting of athae + lass., p. 49
Kingsfoil has the Old French element foil, "leaf" as seen in Wikipedia:cinquefoil., p. 781
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Athelas doesnt appear in the published The Silmarillion or in the tales of the First Age in general; however in the early Lay of Leithian it was used by Huan and Lúthien to heal wounded Beren. It contradicts the information from The Lord of the Rings of it being brought to Middle-earth by Númenóreans, so its history was either revised by J.R.R. Tolkien, or athelas grew in Beleriand before it was destroyed, and then brought back to Middle-earth by Númenóreans in the Second Age.
