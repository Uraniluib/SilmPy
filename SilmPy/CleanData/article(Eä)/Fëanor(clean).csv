== Etymology ==
Fëanors father-name was Curufinwë, "Skillful Finwë", by adding curu, the Quenya noun for "skill", to his fathers name. He later gave his favorite son Curufin the same father-name. His Amilessë was Fëanáro, which translates as "spirit of fire", being formed by adding fëa, a Quenya noun for "spirit" and Nár (Quenya), "flame". Apparently, the masculine ending -o is also present. 
The name Fëanor is the Sindarization version of his mother-name; the proper Sindarin form of his name was Faenor.
