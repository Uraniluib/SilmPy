* Death of Elphir, Princes of Dol Amroth of Dol Amroth., The Line of Dol Amroth, p. 223In the list of the Princes of Dol Amroth in The Peoples of Middle-earth the death of Elphir was first shown as "(3087=) F.A. 57".  This is incorrect since 3087 should correspond to F.A. 67. Later on the same page 3087 is equated with F.A. 67 so the date of 57 was a typo.
* Alphros, son of Elphir, becomes the twenty-fourth Princes of Dol Amroth of Dol Amroth.
