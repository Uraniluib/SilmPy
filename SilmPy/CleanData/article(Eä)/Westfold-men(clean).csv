Westfold-men were the Men of Rohan who lived in the regions westward of Edoras, in the lands beneath the White Mountains. At the time of the War of the Ring, their commander was Erkenbrand. Many of them were lost in the Battles of the Fords of Isen, but enough remained to form the bulk of the defence of Helms Deep when Sarumans forces attacked.
