Utumno (in Quenya) or Udûn (in Sindarin) was a fortress of Morgoth in the far north of Middle-earth. It was the first and greatest of Melkors citadels, delved in the earliest days. It was the home to hosts of demons, the fallen Ainur who allied with Melkor, and numerous monsters of corruption were made in mockery of Middle-earths naturally intended creatures and beings.
==History==
Utumno was built by Melkor after his first expulsion from Arda. The Valar had by this time created the Two Lamps. Utumno was built under the Iron Mountains, where the light of Illuin and Ormal was dim and cold. Though the Valar did not yet know it, from this place, "the blight of his Melkors hatred flowed out thence, and the Spring of Arda was marred."
Melkor used Utumno as his base of operations from the Valian Year 3400 until , when the Valar assailed Melkors fortress, which fell in . From there he had destroyed the Two Lamps, so that the Valar left Almaren, their dwelling-place in Middle-earth, and removed into the West. He then began his corruption of Arda. Utumno was also where the first captured Elves were taken and the creation of Orcs began as a mockery of the Firstborn.
Utumno was laid waste in , in Siege of Utumno that the Valar began against Melkor for the War for the Sake of the Elves. The Valar attacked Udûn in full force, and destroyed it utterly, carrying its master back to Valinor as their prisoner. Melkor was chained and dragged as a captive to Valinor.
Melkor had established a second and lesser fortress at the western end of the Iron Mountains to act as the first line of defence for Utumno from Aman. This became Angband, which was at first held by Sauron. After the destruction of Utumno, Melkor chose to rebuild and fortify Angband as his lair.
==Etymology==
The name Utumno (pron. ), contains the stem Utumnu-. An older version of the name, Utumna, is said to derive from Tumna (Quenya: "low-lying, low, profound, deep").
The name Udûn is Sindarin, meaning "dark pit, Underworld", p. 297 or "hell".
In the Annals of Aman, Tolkien wrote: "Utupnŭ √TUP cover over; hide" and "that stronghold was ever after called Utumno the Deep-hidden." In Etymologies (V.394) with the stem TUB, the original form of the name is given as Utubnu.
Udûn (pron. ) was the less commonly used Sindarin name of Utumno. In The Lord of the Rings, this name appears just once, in Gandalfs words to Durins Bane.
It survived, though, as a name for Udûn (valley) of Mordor that lay behind the Morannon. Undoubtedly, Sauron chose this name in memory of his ancient masters greatest stronghold.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
J.R.R. Tolkien was not entirely consistent with the location of Utumno, but it was always located within the northern Middle-earth, in or behind the Iron Mountains.
As noted from one of Tolkiens earlier sketch maps about Utumno from the Ambarkanta, Utumno was previously spelled as "Utumna" and was north of the Iron Mountains, towards the western end of the mountain chain.
