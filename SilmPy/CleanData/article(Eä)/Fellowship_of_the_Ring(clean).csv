==History==

The Fellowship of the Ring was formed in Rivendell with the purpose to destroy the One Ring, and the only way to do so was to throw it into the Cracks of Doom. It was decided that nine walkers should contrast the Nazgûl of Sauron with Frodo as the Ring-bearers and Gandalf as the leader.
Although the purpose was fixed by the Council of Elrond, it was not decreed how, in what manner and through which route this could be done; such details were left to the Fellowships discretion. As a consequence, the Fellowship started with no detailed plan. One option was to go directly to Mount Doom, the other was to ask help from Boromirs father, Denethor.
The way of how to reach the East was a problem. After moving south from Rivendell, they encountered crebain on their arrival in Eregion. Fearing that they were used as spies by Saruman, the Fellowship spent the entire day in hiding, without a campfire.
When they had to pass the Misty Mountains; Boromir proposed the Gap of Rohan (the way through which he journeyed to Rivendell), Gandalf insisted on passing through Moria but Aragorn thought the Redhorn Pass would be safer. However after attempting in vain to pass the blizzard, they followed Gandalfs option.
After fighting with wolves and the Watcher in the Water, they managed to open the Doors of Durin and enter Moria. 
There they found the Orcs who overran Balins Colony years ago. They also saw Durins Bane, who devastated Moria in the first place. Gandalf to buy them time, destroyed the Bridge of Khazad-dûm and both Maiar fell together into the abyss, while the Company escaped back to the light.
Aragorn was appointed the head of the Company, and their next stop was to meet with Galadriel and Celeborn, the elf-lords of Lothlórien. They stayed there for four weeks, resting and counseling for their plan and route. On their leave, the elves gave them several useful gifts of Galadriel and gave them boats to sail the Anduin.
Meanwhile, Saruman who served Sauron, sent a band of Uruk-hai to capture the Halflings who bore the Ring and bring him to Isengard.
Frodo began to realize not only that Gollum was following them, but also that the Ring was having a malevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir. It was he who tried to take the ring from him, after the passage through the Argonath. In the process, Frodo put on the ring to escape him, but he was followed by Sam. The rest of the Company was attacked by orcs while trying to find the Ring-bearer. Seeing no other halfling, the Orcs succeeded in capturing Merry and Pippin, killing Boromir who tried to protect them.
And so, the Fellowship was broken, but not yet disbanded. Sam followed Frodo down the Emyn Muil having decided to go to Mordor himself. Aragorn with Gimli and Legolas (the "Three Hunters") decided to follow the Orcs into Rohan and rescue Pippin and Merry. Unknown to them all, Gandalf had resurrected and visited Lothlórien after them.
After many adventures the eight remaining members of the Fellowship reunited after the downfall of Sauron.  When King Théodens funeral escort set out from Minas Tirith all eight journey together until they met Treebeard at Orthanc.  There Gimli and Legolas departed to visit the deep places of Fangorn Forest on their way to their own homes, and Aragorn declared that the Fellowship of the Ring was at last ended.

==Inspiration==
The notion of the number nine balancing nine evils (here, the Ringwraiths), is a motif seen in literature, as in the famous Old English Wikipedia:Nine Herbs Charm, where nine herbs are used to remedy nine contagions or venoms that go through the land.
==Terminology==
Though usually called Fellowship of the Ring in adaptations and by fans, the actual term is not used in full until the chapter Many Partings, when Aragorn disbanded it. In the story itself, they are usually referred to as the Fellowship, the Company of the Ring (more so than Fellowship), and the Nine Walkers (in opposition of the Nazgûl who pursued them).
