File:Larry Forcella - Lesser ring.jpg
The lesser rings were forged by the elves as essays in the craft of ring making.   These rings were made sometime between , when Sauron came in disguise to Eregion, and , when they began crafting the greater Rings of Power.
Unlike the greater rings, these were round and unadorned, without gems, much like the One Ring.
Gandalf mentioned these rings to Frodo Baggins when recounting the origins of the Rings of Power. Supposedly also did the messenger of Sauron, who asked Dáin Ironfoot to find and return to Sauron "a little ring, the least of rings", that is, the ring of Bilbo Baggins.
