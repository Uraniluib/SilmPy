Valacirca (Quenya "Sickle of the Valar") was one of the constellations set in the heavens by Varda to enlighten the awakening of the Elves and gathered by Varda from among the ancient stars. It was Seven Stars set in the north as a challenge to Melkor.
In  when Bilbo Baggins came to the Long Lake (on the Nandor raft) he noticed the Valacirca twinkling in the north above the entry of the River Running into the lake.
On 29 September  Frodo Baggins looked out of the window in the hobbits room in Bree and saw the Valacirca bright above the shoulder of Bree-hill.
==Other names==
In Sindarin, the name was translated as Cerch i-balan. The names Otselen and Edegil were also used in reference to the seven stars of the constellation. Hobbits called it the Burning Briar (it was also referred to as the Wain in The Hobbit and the Sickle in The Fellowship of the Ring). The constellation is also known as the Plough, a name used in British English to refer to the seven brightest stars in Ursa Major, known in American English as Big Dipper.  It is unclear whether the Dwarvish constellation Durins Crown, seen in the reflection of Mirrormere, is the Valacirca.
==Inspiration==
Valacirca is identified as the constellation of the wikipedia:Ursa Major.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Valacirca is by far the most important constellation in the heavens of Arda. It is also the first to appear in the mythology that J.R.R. Tolkien began to develop in the 1910s., passim.
In the earliest map that Tolkien made for The Hobbit (referred to as Fimbulfambis map by John D. Rateliff in The History of The Hobbit) the compass rose used a tiny diagram of the Valacirca to indicate "North"., p. 21
