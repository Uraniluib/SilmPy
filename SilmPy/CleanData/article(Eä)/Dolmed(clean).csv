Mount Dolmed was a mountain in the Blue Mountains.
==History==
Mount Dolmed loomed over the only known pass from Eriador into Beleriand. It was here that according to the Dwarves two of the Fathers of the Dwarves, the founders of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards, awoke. Their descendants later established the Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost.
The two cities were established on the Eastern side of the mountain.  Just a little of North-east of Dolmed was Belegost, and a little to the South-east was Nogrod.
In , the First Battle of Beleriand was fought between the Elves, and the forces of Morgoth.  In the end the Elves had the victory and the surviving Orcs fled east toward the Ered Luin.  They were however met by the Dwarves and annihilated by them.    
Almost five hundred years later, a short War of the Elves and Dwarves occurred between the Elves of Doriath and the Dwarves of Nogrod. In , after returning from their victory in Menegroth, the Dwarves were Battle of Sarn Athrad at Sarn Athrad and slaughtered. The survivors were climbing the slopes of Mount Dolmed when they were waylaid and annihilated by Ents.

Some Tolkienists such as Robert Foster and Karen Fonstad speculate that after the War of Wrath Dolmed was destroyed when the Ered Luin were broken and the Gulf of Lune, broke through it.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, page 89Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 37
However, Ronald KyrmseRonald Kyrmse, "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in Mallorn_(journal) no. Mallorn_26, September 1989, pp. 25–27 and later Didier WillisDidier Willis, Bulletin de géographie Hiswelóce, special issue no. 1, Winter 1994 (French); http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Mystères géographiques n°1 : Mont Dolmed & cités naines (c. 2000), http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/index.php?lng=fr Hiwelokë, accessed March 23rd, 2011 (French); revised and augmented in "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" in Tolkien, le façonnement dun monde, vol. 2, 2014, pp. 197-230. independently noted a prominent unidentified mountain exactly on the location of Dolmed in the map of Beleriand as well as Mount Rerir to the north.  This, coupled with a reinterpretation of Tolkiens maps, shows that Dolmed at least partially survived the devastation.
==Etymology==
The name means "wet head" in Sindarin, from dol and med. The word for head is used often in Sindarin to refer to hills.
