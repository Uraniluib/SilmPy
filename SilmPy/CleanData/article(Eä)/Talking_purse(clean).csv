The talking purse was the purse of the Trolls William. When Bilbo Baggins tried to pick the purse from Williams pocket, the purse suddenly squeaked "Ere, oo are you?". William was thus warned of the pickpocketing and captured Bilbo.
The size of the purse was huge: it is told to have been "as big as a bag to Bilbo". Apparently "Trolls purses" were known for their mischief.
==Background==
Tolkien fandom have suggested that the purse was perhaps not made by trolls, but that it was stolen and, because of it ability to speak (like the sword Gurthang), of Dwarves or Elves origin.
==Portrayal in adaptations==

:David T. Wenzel portrays the purse having holes resembling a shouting mouth.
2003: The Hobbit (2003 video game):
:Not only does the purse (called "wallet" in the game) talk, but it has eyes that open up when Bilbo touches it.
