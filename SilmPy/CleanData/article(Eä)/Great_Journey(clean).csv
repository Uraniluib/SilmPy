The Great Journey, or the Great March was the journey that the Elves known as the Eldar took from Cuiviénen, the place of their Awakening of the Elves, to Valinor.
After the War for Sake of the Elves of the Valar against Morgoth much of northern Middle-earth was broken, and then Oromë returned to take the Elves with him into the West. In  the majority of the Elves began to depart and were called Eldar, but a part remained behind, becoming known as the Avari (The "Refusers"), in the Sundering of the Elves. Even the Eldar however were reluctant, being used to the beauties of Middle-earth, and were urged by Oromë and their respective chieftains; the most eager were the Minyar, followed by the Tatyar, and the most reluctant were the Nelyar.
Oromë guided the Eldar north of the Sea of Helcar, passing under the smoke of the ruined Iron Mountains. Some Eldar fled in fear, and disappeared from history, perhaps merging back with the Avari. Later the host passed through a great forest (the Mirkwood), on the path where later was the Dwarf Road, and then long waited at the shores of a Great River Anduin while Oromë sought a way to get them over the Misty Mountains mountains, which were much higher in those days.
By  Oromë returned, having found (or forged) the High Pass (where later was built Rivendell), most Eldar went on, but a group of the Teleri remained behind and went down the Anduin under their leader Dan (or Lenwë), becoming known as the Nandor.
The remaining Eldar passed north of the immense forests that covered all of Eriador, along a route that would become later the Great West Road (that ran through Arnor). Finally in  the Minyar and Tatyar crossed the Ered Luin and reached Beleriand, while the Lindar still lagged behind in Eriador. For this reason they became known as the Teleri (the "Last").
The Teleri finally entered Beleriand in  but remained east of Gelion; in  the first two clans were ferried across Belegaer on Tol Eressëa by Ulmo. When Ulmo returned for them in , the greater part of the Teleri finally crossed Belegaer under Olwe. But a part of the Teleri remained behind again, either because they were enamored by the shores, or because the Eglath were looking for their leader Elwe, becoming the Sindar.
