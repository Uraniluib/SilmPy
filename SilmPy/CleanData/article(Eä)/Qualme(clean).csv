Qualme is a Quenya term that refers to the natural "death" of the Elves.
Although the Elves dont grow old, after the passage of millennia withered their bodies and "passed away" with their physical disappearance. 
Qualme may occur either naturally, or voluntarily by a weariness of life, due to a deep yearning.
