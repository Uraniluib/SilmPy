==History==
File:Donato Giancola - Telchar forging Narsil.jpg‎ - Telchar forging Narsil
The sword was forged during the First Age by the famed Dwarven-smith Telchar of Nogrod. 
In the Second Age, Narsil was an heirloom of the descendants of Elros, the first King of Númenor. Although nothing is said of Narsil during this period, it eventually came into the hands of Elendil, a distant descendant, towards the close of the Second Age.
Elendil carried Narsil in the Battle of Dagorlad where it shone with the light of the Sun and Moon, and then in the Siege of Barad-dûr; but Sauron killed him and the sword broke into two pieces under him as he fell, and its light was extinguished. Elendils son Isildur took up the sword and used its shard to cut the One Ring from the hand of Sauron.  Isildur took the shards home with him. Shortly before Isildur was killed in the second year of the Third Age in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, the shards were rescued by Ohtar, esquire of Isildur. He took them to Rivendell, where Isildurs youngest son Valandil (King of Arnor) was fostered, but Elrond foretold that it wouldnt be forged again until the One Ring was found agan and Sauron returned.
The Shards of Narsil were one of the heirlooms of the Kings of Arnor, and after the Northern Kingdom was destroyed they remained an heirloom of the Rangers of the North.  It was not reforged until the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age in Rivendell as Andúril, the "Flame of the West", for Aragorn, who was by that time the Chieftains of the Dúnedain and heir of Isildur.  
He carried the sword during his journey south as part of the Fellowship of the Ring, and fought with it in many instances. He referred to it as the "Sword That Was Broken" or "The Sword Reforged".
== Etymology ==
Narsil is a Quenya name meaning "red and white flame"., p. 231, p. 29 The name is said to consist of the Sundocarme NAR ("fire"; cf. Nár (Quenya) "fire") + THIL ("white light"). It was a symbolic name, pointing to the Sun and the Moon, the "chief heavenly lights, as enemies of darkness"., p. 425
