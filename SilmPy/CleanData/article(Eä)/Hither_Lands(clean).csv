The Hither Lands was a name for Middle-earth; the lands of mortals as opposed to Aman, the Undying Lands.
On J.R.R. Tolkiens earliest maps of Arda, the term "Hither Lands" was written across both Middle-earth and the southern continent that would eventually contain Harad. Lacking a definite name for this southern landmass, "Hither Lands" is occasionally used by fans.
