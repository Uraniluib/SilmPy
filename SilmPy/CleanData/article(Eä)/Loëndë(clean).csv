Loëndë was also known, especially by the Hobbits, as Mid-years Day. Loëndë was the day that fell in the middle of the year in many of the calendars of Middle-earth. Since Mid-years Day in the Shire Calendar was intended to correspond with the wikipedia:Solstice, then this should apply to loëndë in the Kings Reckoning and Stewards Reckoning calendars of Gondor as well. In the New Reckoning, loëndë corresponded with 24 September in the Shire Calendar.
