__NOTOC__


== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In one version of the Akallabêth, Míriel was betrothed to Elentir, the brother of Amandil (the last Lord of Andúnië). However, she fell desperately in love with Pharazôn and chose to marry him when he took up the Sceptre of Númenor. This story is very different than the tale in the published The Silmarillion, where Ar-Pharazôn takes Míriel very much against her will in order to claim the Sceptre.
