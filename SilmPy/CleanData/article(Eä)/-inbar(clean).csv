inbar "a horn" is an element in the Khuzdul name Caradhras.
==Etymology==
The word derives from the Sundocarmë N-B-R, which was mistyped as Sundocarmë M-B-R, p. 174 in The Treason of Isengard.http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish by Magnus Åberg
Magnus Åberg speculated that the actual word might be *nibar or *mibar since words of three radical vowels such this dont begin with a vowel, but the form given in Parma Eldalamberon 17 is merely inbar. The currently-unpublished notes on Khuzdul phonology and root modifications may shed light on this matter.
