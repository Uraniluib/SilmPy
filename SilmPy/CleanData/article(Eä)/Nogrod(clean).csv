__NOTOC__
Nogrod was one of two Dwarves cities in the Ered Luin that prospered during the First Age. It was home to the Dwarves of Nogrod.
==Description==
Nogrod lay in the north-central part of the mountain range, near Dolmed where the Dwarf-road of Beleriand crossed into Eriador. It guarded one of the only passes through the mountain range., p. 24 ("But the Dwarves had built some great Mansions in those mountains the Ered Luin (commanding the only passes)") It was home to the Dwarves of Nogrod.  Nogrod was also the home to the great Dwarven smiths Gamil Zirak and Telchar., The Departure of Túrin
==History==
The city was built sometime during the Years of the Trees when the western Fathers of the Dwarves awoke from beneath Mount Dolmed., p. 24 ("...which had certainly been founded long ago ... before the coming of the exiled Noldor, probably before the Eldar of the Great Journey ever reached Beleriand")
Nogrod traded with throughout Beleriand and the Dwarves were employed for delvings and crafts, most famously the Nauglamir for King Thingol. Eöl the Dark Elf often went there, as did his son Maeglin. 
At the end of the First Age, Nogrod was ruined in the War of Wrath, and around the Second Age 40 of the Second Age the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began to migrate to Moria, abandoning Nogrod and Belegost.  However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterward. p. 235
==Etymology==
Nogrod is a Sindarin name; it was originally known as Novrod which means "hollow delving" aka Hollowbold, like its original Khuzdul name, Tumunzahar. 
Novrod was altered to Naugrod under the influence of the similar-sounding word Naug "dwarf". Therefore while the name Hollowbold is provided as the translation of Nogrod it is not a literal translation; the new name means rather "Dwarf dwelling"., entry "Nogrod"
The second element of Novrod/Nogrod is Sindarin groth/grod meaning "delving, underground dwelling". 
In The Etymologies the name is labelled as Noldorin and is said to contain the element Naug "dwarf". The second element -rod is not explained, but a note by Christopher Tolkien points to entry ROD, an etymological root meaning "cave". Relevant Noldorin words include rhond "cave" and rhaud "hollow, cavernous"., entries NAUK, ROD
Its name in Khuzdul was Tumunzahar (meaning "Hollowbold"), and its Quenya name was Návarot., p. 389
