The Stonefoots were one of seven houses of the Dwarves that dwelt in the mountains of the East. They were originally paired with the Blacklocks., pp. 301, 322 (note 24)
It is possible that the Stonefoots were among the "Houses of other Fathers" who sent troops to help Durins Folk in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.

: The unnamed Dwarven tribes were given invented names in an early supplement. While these were published before the publication of Tolkiens late note on the name of the Dwarven houses of the East, it has been suggested that the Stonefoots could correspond to Barins Tribe (as portrayed in Middle-earth Role Playing).Thomas Morwinsky, "A Brief History of the Dwarven Mansions", in Other Minds issue 4 (July 2008)
2002-5: The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game:
