Upbourn was a hamlet located in Rohan, south of Edoras on the banks of the Snowbourn in the valley of Harrowdale.
==Etymology==
The name is a modernisation of the Old English Upburnan as would represent Rohirric.
It derives from the fact that the hamlet was some way "up" the river Snowbourn.
As J.R.R. Tolkien noted, up- is used in English place-names for river-side villages (as wikipedia:Upavon in wikipedia:Wiltshire), especially in contrast to larger places near its mouth (as wikipedia:Upwey, Dorset above wikipedia:Weymouth, Dorset)., p. 778
