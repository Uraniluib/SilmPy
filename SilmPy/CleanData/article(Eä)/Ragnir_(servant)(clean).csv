 
Ragnir was a servant of the Lady Morwen.  When Morwen informed her young son Túrin that it was time for him to leave Dor-lómin he objected, and part of his objection was that his mother would be left with only old women and two male servants, Sador who was lame and Ragnir who was blind.  Nevertheless, Túrin did leave in fulfillment of his mothers command.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When Húrin returned to Dor-lómin many years later he picked up a small party of followers who went with him over the mountains and into the wild.  One companion was also named Ragnir, but he was almost certainly not the same person as blind Ragnir the servant., note 24, p. 302
