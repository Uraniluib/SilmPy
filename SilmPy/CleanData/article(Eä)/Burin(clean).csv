 
Burin was a Dwarf that J.R.R. Tolkien abandoned while in the process of creating The Lord of the Rings.
==History==
Burin first started out as the son of Balin and attended the council of Elrond with Glóin, as well as accompanying the Fellowship of the Ring on their quest.  When that idea was abandoned and Gimli was created in his stead, the name was used for the father of Balin, but that was scrapped in favour of Fundin.
==Etymology==
Burin, or Burinn, is a dwarf from the Völuspá. His name most likely means "Son-like".Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967
