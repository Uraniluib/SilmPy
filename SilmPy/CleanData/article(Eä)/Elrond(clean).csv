1977: The Hobbit (1977 film):
:Elrond appears in Rivendell, crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the Thorin and Company, and identifies Orcrist and Glamdring. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although Tolkien clearly states Elves do not have beards. His voice was provided by Cyril Ritchard.
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Elrond, voiced by André Morell, appears at the Council of Elrond. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until the One Ring is brought forward does he take an active part.
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:Elrond appears roughly the same as in the first of Rankin/Bass films. The premise of the film, a minstrel of Gondor who tells the tale of "Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom" at Bilbo Baggins 129th birthday party in Rivendell, allows Elrond to be a member of the audience. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on The Hobbit, Rankin/Bass regular Paul Frees took over as his voice.
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
:Elrond, played by Hugo Weaving, first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of Gil-galad in the War of the Last Alliance. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking Isildur into Mount Doom, trying to persuade him to destroy the Ring. Círdan is omitted. 
:As in the book, Elrond heals Frodo Bagginss wound from Weathertop. Elrond then has a conversation with Gandalf, discussing the many challenges that face them.  Elrond argues that the Ring cannot remain in Rivendell (in the film, Frodo appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Ring there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of Men, and gives the first hints about Aragorns real identity. In the Council of Elrond, Elrond himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Ring. He does not select the Fellowship, but accepts those who volunteer.
:Elrond gains two additional scenes in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition) of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aragorn beside the grave of Aragorn’s mother. Elrond encourages the reluctant Aragorn to accept his fate of becoming Kings of Gondor. In the next scene, Elrond blesses the departing Fellowship of the Ring.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers:
:Though he had no scenes in the book, Elrond appears mainly in conversations with Arwen, whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aragorn remembers Elrond telling him to abandon his love for Arwen, allowing her to sail to Valinor. Aragorn attempts to do this, but Arwen denies him. In another scene, Elrond persuades Arwen that she should sail to Valinor, describing what will happen if she remains and Aragorn dies. Elrond then has a telepathic communication with Galadriel discussing the War of the Ring that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to Helms Deep to aid the Rohirrim there, since when Haldir arrives at Helms Deep he says that he brings "word from Elrond of Rivendell."
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King:
:In the final installment of Jacksons film series, Elronds first scene is with Arwen, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Elrond acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the shards of Narsil Andúril, then carries the new sword to Aragorn at Dunharrow. He finally convinces Aragorn to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the Paths of the Dead. Later, Elrond escorts Arwen to Minas Tirith for Aragorn coronation, and he finally sails to Valinor with the Ring-bearers.
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Elrond. As in the book, he identifies Gandalfs and Thorins respective swords, as well as translating the Moon-letters on Thorins Thrórs Map in the The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey film. There is an additional scene where Elrond meets with the White Council. Like Saruman, Elrond is somewhat skeptical of Gandalfs claims, deeming the Quest of Lonely Mountain unwise. However, he is clearly alarmed by Gandalfs revealing of the Morgul-knife from Dol Guldur. Elrond is seen again in the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies of these films where he participates in the Attack on Dol Guldur of Dol Guldur, joining Saruman in fighting off the Nazgûl.

1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):

He reappears in the final 2 episodes - first in the return to Rivendell warning Frodo to look out for Bilbo in the Shire one Autumn soon, and finally with Galadriel and Bilbo in the Shire before they all ride to the Grey Havens.
