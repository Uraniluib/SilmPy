Eöl the Dark Elf hated the sunlight. He lived among the deep forest shadows of Nan Elmoth and emerged from his halls only under the stars. When he wedded Aredhel of Gondolin, she, too, took on a life of darkness and shade. When she gave birth to a son, she gave him a secret Quenya name, Lómion, meaning "Child of the Twilight". 
The childs father Eöl gave him no name until he was twelve years old. At that time, Eöl selected the name Maeglin, "Sharp Glance", and it is by the name Maeglin that Lómion became known to history.
