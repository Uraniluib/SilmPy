:Ethring was the only settlement in the Ringl贸 Vale. During the War of the Ring, it was ruled by "Lord Borhador", who dwelt in the Crossing-Hall. Due to Borhadors old age, his son Dervorin led the soldiers of the Vale to Minas Tirith in his stead, and his other son "Arvaethor" assisted in protecting the Vale.
