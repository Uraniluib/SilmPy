Eru was considered transcendental, removed and distant from the affairs of Arda and was seldom worshiped and His name was too holy to be invoked. 
Manwë made a high feast in praise of Eru to celebrate each gathering of fruits. The Númenoreans worshiped Eru in the Three Prayers held during the course of a coranar. 
Fëanor swore Oath of Fëanor in the name of Eru. Elendil bound the Last Alliance of Elves and Men with an oath to Eru; the next known instance when a Man invoked Erus name "who is above all thrones for ever", was by Cirion, millennia later.
==Etymology==
===Eru===
Eru is a Quenya name meaning "He that is Alone"., p. 83
===Ilúvatar===
Ilúvatar (pron. Noldorin , Vanyarin ) is Quenya for "the Father of All", more commonly referred to as Ilúvatar.
The name Ilúvatar is a compound of two words, ilu and ilúvë "universe" and atar "father."
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Ilúvatar appears since the earliest form of the Legendarium, in The Book of Lost Tales. It is to be noted that in earlier works of the legendarium the name Ilúvatar meant "Sky-father" since the element il- refers also to the sky (cf. Ilmen), but this etymology was dropped in favour of the newer meaning in later revisions. 
In the earlier versions Ilúvatar was the main name of God used. Another name was Ainatar "Father of Gods" — the word Eru first appeared in The Annals of Aman.
==Inspiration==
Tolkien understood Eru not as a "fictional deity" but as a name in a fictional language for the actual monotheistic God, although in a mythological or fictional context. In a draft of a letter of 1954 to Peter Hastings, manager of the Newman Bookshop (a Catholic bookshop in Oxford), Tolkien defended non-orthodox aspects as rightly within the scope of his mythology, as an exploration of the infinite "potential variety" of God. Regarding the possibility of reincarnation of Elves, Hastings had written:

Tolkiens reply contains an explanation of his view of the relation of (divine) Creation to (human) sub-creation:

Hastings had also criticized the description of Tom Bombadil by Goldberry: "He is", saying that this seemed to imply that Bombadil was God. 	 
Tolkien replied to this:	 
:As for Tom Bombadil, I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point. ... You rather remind me of a Protestant relation who to me objected to the (modern) Catholic habit of calling priests Father, because the name father belonged only to the First Person.
