Sebastian is the name of Radagasts hedgehog in Peter Jacksons film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Radagast discovers a sickness falling upon Mirkwood while just outside his Rhosgobel one day, seeing several plants and animals that are dead or dying -- Sebastian being one of the latter. He brings the hedgehog back in an attempt to revive him, but none of his home remedies work. In the process, several large spiders begin to descend on Rhosgobel. Radagast decides to use his magic on Sebastian, and when he finishes his incantation of the spell, the spiders return to the Dol Guldur from whence they came. Meanwhile, the spell has cured Sebastian, and he appears completely back to normal.
Sebastian is featured in the figurine "Radagast the Brown with Sebastian" released for The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game, displayed hiding by the feet of Radagast.
