The haven of Rómenna was the main seaport of Númenor situated on its east coast, through which much of the traffic with the old lands of Middle-earth passed. Many of the Faithful were forced to relocate to Rómenna late in Númenors history.
==Overview==
Rómenna was located in the region of Arandor about 50 miles east of the capital city of Armenelos. The port stood on the south side of the Firth of Rómenna which opened onto the Bay of Rómenna and then onto the Sea. The main road of Númenor ran from Rómenna through Armenelos past Meneltarma and on to Andúnië on the west coast.
==History==
Rómenna was the greatest port in Númenor. There were large shipyards in Rómenna and the most highly skilled shipwrights worked there. The mariner Vëantur had a house with its own quay in Rómenna and Tar-Aldarion frequently came there and kept his ships in the harbour.
Tar-Meneldur closed the shipyards in Rómenna during a dispute with his son Tar-Aldarion in . The shipyards were reopened in  and Aldarion repaired and expanded the harbour works and built sea-walls. Aldarions wife Erendis died in the water at Rómenna in .
During the reign of Ar-Gimilzôr (-), many of the Faithful of Númenor were forced to relocate from Andúnië to Rómenna so the Kings Men could keep watch on them. More were drawn there by Amandil, the leader of the Faithful during the reign of Ar-Pharazôn. When Númenor was destroyed in , the Faithful led by Elendil boarded ships at Rómenna and escaped to Middle-earth.
==Etymology==
The name Rómenna means "eastwards" in Quenya from rómen meaning "east" and the suffix -nna indicating movement towards.
