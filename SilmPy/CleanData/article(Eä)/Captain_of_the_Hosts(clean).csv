Captain of the Hosts was a military title of Gondor, perhaps the supreme military position in the Kingdom.
The title is mentioned alongside the name of Prince Tarannon who, in this capacity, extended the realm along the shores. As King of Gondor, he later took the name "Falastur". It is possible that the position was held by the Kings Heir or another member of the House of An√°rion.
