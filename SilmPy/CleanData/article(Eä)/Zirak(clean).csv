zirak is a Khuzdul word, appearing in Celebdil#Etymology ("tine of silver")., p. 35
The word also appears as a short form of Zirakzigil, the Dwarves name for the mountain called Celebdil or Silvertine by other races.  Gimli referred to the Mountains of Moria as Baraz, Zirak, and Shath√ªr when he first saw them.
As zigil apparently means "silver", Zirak presumably means "tine" in Khuzdul.
