The name Legolas is a Silvan Elvish dialect form of pure Sindarin Laegolas, which means "Greenleaf". At one point he is called "Legolas Greenleaf" by Gandalf, coupling his name and its translation like an epithet.Greenleaf is not his surname, as is sometimes erroneously believed; nor is it an epithet (like Oakenshield). 
Legolas consists of the Sindarin words laeg, a very rare, archaic word for "green" (cf. Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim, the Green Elves), which is normally replaced by calen (cf. Calenhad, Parth Galen and Pinnath Gelin); and golas, a collection of leaves, foliage (being a prefixed collective form of lass, "leaf")., pp. 84, 153 The Quenya cognate of Laegolas is said to be Laicolasse., p. 56Helge Fauskanger, http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
A character "Legolas (elf of Gondolin)" appears firstly in The Fall of Gondolin (chapter) in The Book of Lost Tales (in the context of another unrelated character) who guided some survivors of the sack of the city to safety. His Qenya name is Laiqalassë., §2 Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin
Tolkien considered Glorfindel to be the Elven character of the Fellowship, however he dropped the idea, and Legolas was created to replace him. Perhaps this is the reason why Legolas is considered the most underdeveloped character of the Fellowship, playing only a minor role in The Lord of the Rings.

1955: The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series):
:Frank Duncan was the voice of Legolas.
1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):
:Legolas was voiced by Anthony Daniels. In the film, he takes Glorfindels place in the Flight to the Ford sequence; he meets Strider and the hobbits on their way to Rivendell, and sets Frodo on his horse before he is chased by the Nazgûl to the ford of Bruinen. Here, he is apparently from Rivendell, because he answers to Elrond; he is not identified as a Wood-elf.
1979: The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series):
:John Vickery provided the voice of Legolas.
1980: The Return of the King (1980 film):
:Neither Legolas nor Gimli appeared in this film, as they were essentially followers irrelevant to the plot.
1981: The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series):
:David Collings provided the voice of Legolas.
2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):
:Michael Reisz provided the voice of Legolas.
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Legolas was portrayed by Orlando Bloom. 
:In the "official movie guide" for The Lord of the Rings, a birthdate for Legolas is set to 87 of the Third Age. This would make him 2931 years old at the time of the War of the Ring. This date for Legolas birth was made up by the movie writers. Curiously, the year 2931 was the year Aragorn was born; the writers may have picked the number at random from the Tale of Years in the Appendix B.
:He is presented as an unstoppable fighter, arguably to the point of stealing the show; he performs show-stopping yet implausible stunts in battle scenes. For example, in the Battle of the Hornburg, he slides down a staircase using a shield, shooting arrows all the while, and in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, he takes down an Oliphaunts all by himself. However, in the books, Legolass exploits in battle are not presented in great detail. Aside from shooting the fell beast, he undertakes no major actions other than to make peace with Gimli, overcoming their longstanding mutual racial animosity — he and Gimli are followers, rather than leaders. The film-makers later stated that the entire scene of Legolas killing the Oliphaunt and its entire crew was filmed during pick-ups (months after original filming) to insert a major action scene showcasing him, because at that point they realized that he simply doesnt get to do much in the third part of the trilogy.
:Legolas bears two long knives, while in the book he bears only one. Another, more trivial change, was the number of Orcs he and Gimli kill at Helms Deep: 42 and 43, respectively. It is not clear whether this was an intentional change on the part of the filmmakers, though it seems likely that it was, since the original numbers were so clear in Tolkiens own text.
:Playing Legolas in the trilogy was Orlando Blooms breakout route to superstardom. His handsome features and Legolas "coolness", so to speak, as depicted in the film, have led to the character becoming an unprecedented fan favourite with both fangirls and fanboys, not to mention other Tolkien fans. Although the disproportionate popular reaction to Legolas met with mixed reactions from fans, many debaters on the Internet during earlier stages of production were worried that a film portrayal of Legolas might render him as far too effeminate for popular consumption. Later, many felt that Bloom was able to avoid this entirely. Christopher Tolkien recounts that his father wrote the following "wrathful" comment protesting against a "pretty" or "ladylike" depiction of Legolas: 

2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game):

2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
: Orlando Bloom reprised his role as Legolas in Peter Jacksons adaptation of the Hobbit. Bloom was Wikipedia:de-aging in film to match his appearance as Legolas in Lord of the Rings 13 years ago. He is one of the Elves who capture Thorin and Company who traverse Mirkwood. His company, including Tauriel, were ordered by Thranduil to clean up the spider nests. As he examines Gloin, he finds a locket with a picture of Gimli, his future friend, and comments on his ugliness. His father notices Legolass affection for Tauriel, which he doesnt approve because she is a pure Silvan-elf. However he joins her in pursuit of the pack of Orcs (led by Bolg) who are after Thorin. Thranduil and Legolas later interrogates Narzug, a captured Orc. Alarmed by the news, Thranduil orders his Realm to be sealed from the outside world, but when Legolas hears that Tauriel has ran after Kili, he leaves to find her.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:Legolas appears after the destruction of Lake-town. With Tauriel he goes to investigate the Orcs armies in Gundabad where his mother was killed during an old battle, something about which his father never talks. He returns to the ruins of Dale where the Lake-men are regrouping. He participates in the Battle of Five Armies and goes with Tauriel to the Ravenhill to support Thorin. In order to save Tauriel from Bolg, he uses a mutilated Trolls to demolish an ancient tower and duels with Bolg. Bitter with his fathers treatment towards Tauriel, he says that he wont return to Mirkwood; Thranduil advices him to go to Eriador and find the Rangers of the North and a young ranger called "Strider (Aragorn)." Before parting, Thranduil assures him that his mother loved him more than anything else.
