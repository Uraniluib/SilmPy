In the introduction to The Grey Annals, Christopher Tolkien stated that they were written in the 1930s., p, 3  This work was laid aside while J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings, after which he returned to his work on the elder days.  In his later writings Tolkien relocated the coming of the Edain over the Blue Mountains nearly a century earlier, which occasioned a large-scale overhaul of the chronology and genealogies., The new genealogies of the Edain, p. 229
In the older Grey Annals Bëor was followed by his sons Bregolas and Barahir.  In the new version four generations were inserted between Bëor and the brothers Bregolas and Barahir.  Along with this change Belen was added as the ancestor of Beren., (i) The House of Bëor
