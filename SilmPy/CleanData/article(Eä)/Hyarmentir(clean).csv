Hyarmentir (Quenya, pron. ) was a mighty mountain to the south and east of Valinor, perhaps of the Pel√≥ri. It was one of the tallest in Aman, but not as Taniquetil to the north, which was the tallest of the world. 
Morgoth and Ungoliant climbed it, as Ungoliant wrought her webs between clefts and pinnacles. From its summit, they looked out over the Tree-lit land of the Valar, before they descended Hyarmentirs long, shallow western slopes and set out to destroy the light of Valinor of the Two Trees.
