The Bay of Belfalas, also called the windy Bay of Bel,, p. 15 was a great gulf of the Belegaer lying to the south of Gondor, within whose waters stood the island of Tolfalas; the River Anduin flowed into the Bay.  Directly north of it was the Gondorian region of Belfalas.
During the Akallabêth, the Bay of Belfalas was much filled at the east and south, and land upheaved around it. Anduin carved a new path by many Ethir Anduin to the Bay.
Tolfalas was almost destroyed, and was left at last like a barren and lonely mountain in the water not far from the issue of the River.
==Other names==
