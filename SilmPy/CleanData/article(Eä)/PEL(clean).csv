__NOTOC__
PEL, or PELE, is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme signifying "edge, bound, fence, limit, border"., pp. 65, 92, 171 (roots appearing as "√PEL", "PEL", "√PELE)"
In his Appendix to The Silmarillion, Christopher Tolkien noted the Elvish element or root pel- (signifying "go round, encircle"). It is unknown if he reconstructed this element from writings by J.R.R. Tolkien which have appeared in print after 1977 (when the work was first published), or if he used manuscripts which still are unpublished.
