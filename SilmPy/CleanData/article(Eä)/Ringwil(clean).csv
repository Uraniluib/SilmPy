The river Ringwil was a short and foaming river of West Beleriand that flowed east through the hilly Taur-en-Faroth north of Nargothrond until it joined the Narog.  Where it met the Narog a secret door was built, which was used by LÃºthien to escape from Nargothrond when Celegorm and Curufin held her prisoner.
