__NOTOC__
BAN is a Primitive Quendian Sundocarme with two different significations. BAN1 signifies "fair, beautiful", originally having "referred simply to beauty — but with implication that it was due to lack of fault, or blemish"., pp. 149-50 (root appearing as "√BAN." and "√BAN-; BAN-") BAN2 signifies "meet, come up against"., p. 150 (appearing as "√BAN")
J.R.R. Tolkien experimented with the idea that BAN was related to MAN ("good").
