__NOTOC__
russa is a Quenya adjective which means "red-haired" or "russet".
==Etymology==
It obviously derives from a root *RUS-. See RUSKÄ€, p. 385
==Examples==
*Ambarussa
*Minyarussa
*Atyarussa
* Russandol = Copper-Top
==See also==
*russe
==Inspiration==
The word russa represents the color called "russet" in English, which derives from the Latin word Wiktionary:russus "red". Although we cant know if the similarities between the Quenya word and russet/russus were intentional by Tolkien, it is possible that they are.
