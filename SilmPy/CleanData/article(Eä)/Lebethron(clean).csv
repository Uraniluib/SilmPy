Lebethron was a hardwood tree that grew in Ithilien.
==History==
Lebethron was said to be fair, and beloved by the woodworkers of Gondor.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, "Journey to the Cross-Roads" The staves given by Faramir to Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were made of lebethron, as was the casket, described as made of "black lebethron", in which he brought the Crown of Gondor to the coronation of Aragorn.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, "The Steward and the King"
==Etymology==
The name was invented by Tolkien at the time of writing, as melinon, then lebendron and finally lebethras. It was replaced by lebethron on the fair manuscript copy. pp. 180 and 207.
According to a later source, lebethron was a Gondor Sindarin word. The first element, lebeth, was related to Quenya lepsë,J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Gilson (ed.), "Words, Phrases & Passages in The Lord of the Rings", published in Parma Eldalamberon Parma Eldalamberon 17 (July 2007), page 89. "finger".J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, The Lost Road and Other Writings, "The Etymologies" The second element was said to be derived from oron, "tree", though a later addition also ties it to the Sundocarmë RUN, "rub, grind, smooth, polish". In this light, the tree was named lebethorn, and the wood of the tree lebethron, and the two words merged into one over time.
