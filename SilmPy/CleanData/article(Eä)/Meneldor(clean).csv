Meneldor was a great Eagles of the northern mountains, one of the followers of Gwaihir. He was among the squadron of Eagles who flew to the aid of the Captains of the West in the last desperate battle before the Gate of Mordor. With his lord Gwaihir, and Gwaihirs brother Landroval, he flew into the Mordor to the rescue of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, and carried one of these two (we are not told which) out of the destruction of Mount Doom.
