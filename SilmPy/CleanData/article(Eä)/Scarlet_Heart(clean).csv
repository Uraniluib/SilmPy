In J.R.R. Tolkiens earlier work The Fall of Gondolin (chapter), the Scarlet Heart was the heart of Finwë, then Turgon father, cut out by orcs in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad., p. 241  It was regained by Turgon, and made the emblem of his House of the King., Note 27, p. 200
If this story survived to be Tolkiens "final intent", then the heart would probably be that of Fingon, Turgons brother.  Finwë was slain by Morgoth himself in Aman, Fingolfins body was taken away by Thorondor before Morgoth could desecrate it, and Fëanors body turned to ashes after death.  But altogether it is doubtful that Tolkien ever kept this story, but changed or abandoned it with much of the other material found in the Fall.
