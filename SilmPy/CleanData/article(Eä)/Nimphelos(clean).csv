Nimphelos was a huge pearl said to have been the size of a doves egg (that is, an inch or more in diameter) that was found along the shores of the Isle of Balar by the Falathrim. Círdan gave it, along with many lesser pearls, to his friend and ally Thingol. When Thingol called on the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in the building of Menegroth, Nimphelos was among the rewards he gave them, and the Lord of Belegost was said to have prized the pearl over a mountain of wealth., pp. 11, 108 (§22)
