==Genealogy==


==Other versions of the legendarium==
A different Vairë (wife of Lindo) appeared in some of J.R.R. Tolkiens earliest writings. In The Book of Lost Tales Part One, she was an Elves of Tol Eressëa, and the daughter of Tulkastor. She and her husband Lindo tell the stories that would become the Quenta Silmarillion to the human mariner Ælfwine/Eriol. Her role as storyteller may have influenced the naming of the Vala responsible for recording stories., p. 16
