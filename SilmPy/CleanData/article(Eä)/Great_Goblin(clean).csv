The Great Goblin was the chief of the Orcs#Orcs and Goblins who dwelt in Goblin-town beneath the High Pass in the Misty Mountains, and presumably was the leader of all the Orcs of the Misty Mountains., entry "Great Goblin"  He was described as "tremendous" and had a huge head.
==History==
In  Thorin and Company were captured by the Great Goblins people after taking refuge in a Front Porch while crossing the Misty Mountains.  When the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins were hauled before the Great Goblin he questioned them regarding their intentions, while accusing them of being spies, thieves, murderers, and friends of Elves.  When one of his guards showed the Great Goblin Thorins sword, Orcrist, he howled with rage and rushed at Thorin with open mouth.  At that moment all of the lights in the cave were extinguished and a flashing sword stabbed the Great Goblin fatally.  The company soon realized that it was Gandalf who had killed the Great Goblin with his blade Glamdring.
==Legacy==
It was the death of the Great Goblin that tickled Beorns fancy enough to gain the Company access to his hall and hospitality.  Once Beorn confirmed their tale he warmed up to true friendship and provided the party with aid, advice, and mounts to ride to the border of Mirkwood.
A further consequence of the Great Goblins demise was a rekindling of the goblins hatred towards Dwarves, which led to preparations for war to secure domination of the North.  The goblins assembled at Mount Gundabad and were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of Smaug.  Altering their plans, the goblins marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at Lonely Mountain, almost immediately after the arrival of Dáin Ironfoot, and participated the Battle of Five Armies.
