__NOTOC__
-nd is a toponymical ending in Sindarin, an ending "commonly used in the names of regions or countries". Vowels could be attached to the ending, yielding the forms -and, -end, -ond. In names such as Rohan, the -d was dropped, due to its lack of pronunciation in speech (this also occurred in Anorien and Ithilien)., p. 248
The form also appears as -ian(d), -iann, -ion, -ien., pp. 42-3, 115

*Cardolan
*Rohan
===With e===
*Hildórien (note that Hildor is a Quenya name)
*Arthórien
*Arvernien
*Lothlorien
*Ithilien
*Anorien
===With o===
*Dorthonion
*Dorwinion
*Region
*Lindon
*Eregion
*Calenardhon
==Etymology==
-ian(d) and ultimately -ien are reduced from -iand(a), -iend(e), p.37 and said to be derived from PQ yandē "a wide region, or country".
-(i)on appears in later-formed names and is in origin distinct from the above. It is explained to be from root YANA- and/or root YONO.
==Cognates==
Relevant endings dont appear in other languages such as Quenya save perhaps the name Hildórien and Calacirian (from Kalakiryande), p. 70. However there is the Qenya name Valariande p.202 and Ossiriande., pp. 158-9 The book The Road Goes Ever On (book) gives the Quenya name of Lothlórien as Lóriende.
The above hint that in Quenya the endings were preserved as -iande and -iende, without loss of final -e. On the other hand, Valariande is perhaps non-canon as early Qenya (but consistent to the later rules of phonology); as for Lóriende, it seems to be constructed after the Sindarin name and can not be indicative of Quenya etymology.
