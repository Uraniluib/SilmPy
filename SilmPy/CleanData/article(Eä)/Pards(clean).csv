Pards were Wikipedia:Felidae only mentioned in Hobbits poetry. Apparently the pards lived in wooded lands of the East (perhaps referring to the lands beyond Rh√ªn, the Uttermost East). The beast, "fleet upon feet", leaped on its prey from above.
==Inspiration==
At the Bodleian Library in Oxford are kept several manuscripts of medieval bestiaries containing descriptions of the legendary pard. The animal is described as very swift, killing its prey with a single leap. It was believed that the mating of a pard and a lions produced the leopard."http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast116.htm Pard" at http://bestiary.ca/ The Medieval Bestiary (accessed 12 March 2011) In 1962 J.R.R. Tolkien published the poem "Cat (poem)",, which, carrying many similarities with this medieval notion, shows that he was likely familiar with these manuscripts.
