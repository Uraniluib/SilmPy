Dol Amroth was a promontory situated on a peninsula in Gondor facing the Bay of Belfalas. 
The emblem of the Prince of Dol Amroth was a silver-upon-blue banner, bearing a ship with a swan-prow upon the sea.
==Description==
Its northern shore defined part of Cobas Haven, the small bay into which the Morthond River flowed.  Upon the headland the Princes of Dol Amroth established a castle and thus Dol Amroth referred to this stronghold and to the neighboring port-city, the chief city of the fief of Belfalas.  Within the walls of the city was the Sea-ward Tower or Tirith Aear,  which had a bell that was rung for the benefit of mariners.
==History==
Elves refugees from Beleriand, p. 247 settled the area and established an Elven settlement about 50 miles north of the promontory, at Edhellond, note 18, p. 255
During the Second Age, a Númenóreans family of the Faithful settled near the Elves. Elendil who was of their kin, gave them title to rule the fief of Belfalas.  They built their stronghold upon the promontory.
According to one story, Galadriel and Celeborn dwelt among the Elves of Dol Amroth., p. 240 When the Elvish king Amroth was lost at sea in  the last of these Elves left the realm which from then on became a realm of Men. 
It was from the name of this king that Dol Amroth (the "Hill of Amroth") took its name. The first Prince of Dol Amroth was Galador, the son of Imrazôr. According to legend, Imrazôr had married the Elven-lady Mithrellas., Note 39, p. 316
Being a coastal city, Dol Amroth was subject to occasional attacks by the Corsairs of Umbar.  The fifteenth prince was slain in battle against these sea raiders in ., The House of Dol Amroth, p. 222
In all there were twenty-one Princes of Dol Amroth before the twenty-second, Imrahil, led a company of knights and a contingent of 700 men from the city to Minas Tirith during the War of the Ring.
==Population==
The first settlers of the area were Sindar from Beleriand until Faithful from Númenor came to the promonitory. The last Elves left in TA 1981.
The Faithful and later the Gondorians that settled in Dol Amroth never intermarried with Middle Men so as a result, the citizens were of pure Númenórean blood and, according to the legend of Mithrellas, their Princes had an Elvish strain. 
The people of Dol Amroth were tall, grey-eyed, and dark-haired. They were famous as the most skillful harp players in all of Gondor, who played at the coronation of Aragorn. The inhabitants of Dol Amroth and in the lands nearby were some of the few people of Gondor who spoke Sindarin on a daily basis.
==Etymology==
Dol Amroth is Sindarin from dol "hill" and Amroth "Upclimber".
