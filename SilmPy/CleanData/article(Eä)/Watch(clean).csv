The Watch was a body of Hobbits responsible for maintaining the peace in the Shire. Its members wore caps with feathers to distinguish themselves.
It consisted of the Shirriffs, a police force of twelve hobbits (three in each Farthings) responsible for Internal Work, and the Bounders, a larger body that guarded the borders of the Shire. The head of the Watch was the First Shirriff, a post attached to that of the Mayor of Michel Delving.
During Sarumans occupation, the body was greatly increased by him and the Chief Shirriff.  This expanded force was organized into companies, one of which was the First Eastfarthing Troop.
