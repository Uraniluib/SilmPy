Boldog was the name of an Orcs chieftain during the First Age as well as likely a title for Maiar who took Orc-shape. 
== History ==
Morgoth, hearing of the beauty of Lúthien and pondering the purposes of Thingol, sent a great force against Doriath, led by Boldog; but with another purpose also - for Morgoth wanted to take Lúthien into Angband, for reasons undisclosed. However, the Iathrim defeated the invading army and Thingol himself slew Boldog.
Some time later, when Finrod, Beren, Edrahil and their companions (clad in Orc-form) were brought before Sauron, they said that they were a part of the army under the command of Boldog, and had urgent news to deliver to Thangorodrim - but Sauron saw through their disguise, revealing to them that Boldog was slain but lately, and also due to Berens dismay and anger due to Saurons mention of Lúthien and how Morgoth coveted her.
== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In Tolkiens later works, he proposed that the name "Boldog" was not merely the name of an individual, but rather a title borne by Orc-shaped Maiar:
Some of these things may have been delusions and phantoms but some were no doubt shapes taken by the servants of Morgoth, mocking and degrading the very forms of the children. For Melkor had in his service great numbers of Maiar, who had the power, as their Master, of taking visible and tangible shape in Arda.  (Morgoths Ring, "Myths transformed", text X)
Boldog (&#8230;) is a name that occurs many times in the tales of Battles of Beleriand. But it is possible that Boldog was not a personal name, and either a title, or else the name of a kind of creature: the Orc-formed Maiar, only less formidable than the Balrogs (Authors footnote to the text X)
Melkor had corrupted many spirits &mdash; some great as Sauron, or less as Balrogs. The least could have been primitive Orcs. (Authors note to text)
