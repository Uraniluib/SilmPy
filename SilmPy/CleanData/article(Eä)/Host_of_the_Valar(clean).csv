The Host of the Valar or Host of the West was the mighty army that overthrew Morgoth and his legions at the end of the First Age. 
The army itself was composed of Vanyar under Ingwion, and the remaining Noldor of Valinor, under Finarfin. Manwës herald Eönwë came with them, and possibly other Maiar and some Valar also joined the Host.No other Ainur are mentioned, but Eönwës presence alone is an indication that other Maiar would accompany him, if not some Valar as well. This is implied by the name "Host of the Valar" itself as well as the cataclysmic result of the War which drowned Beleriand. Cf. , p. 202 and Michael Martinezs http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/10/10/how-was-beleriand-destroyed-in-the-war-of-wrath/ article: " It would be reasonable to infer that some of the Valar also accompanied the Host — presumably Tulkas and Oromë would have wanted to be included in that conflict."
They were brought to Middle-earth by the ships of Falmari, who took pity on the words of Elwing; however the Falmari refused to fight beside the Noldor, remembering the First Kinslaying.
The Host of the West met Morgoths Host of the North in the titanic clash of the War of Wrath. Assisted by the Great Eagles and Earendil, they were victorious.
