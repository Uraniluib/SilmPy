Anach (from an = "long") was a long, narrow pass that ran down out of the highlands of Dorthonion, cutting south-west between the near-impassable mountains of the Crissaegrim and Ered Gorgoroth. Towards its southern end, where it opened into the land of Dimbar, were the springs of the River Mindeb.
In the later years of the First Age, Dorthonion fell under Morgoths control, and with it the Pass of Anach. His Orcs began to use it as a way down from the highlands, building a road through the valley to reach and harass the lands beyond. Ultimately they succeeded in conquering not only Dimbar, but also the regions to the east that ran along the borders of Doriath.
