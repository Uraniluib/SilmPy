==Inspiration and Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkiens concept of Faërie uses a deliberate variant spelling of fairy. While both spellings derive from Middle English faie ("possessing magical powers"), the name fairy carries connotations of prettiness. Tolkien wanted to distance himself from this modern sense, and by using Faërie (variants included Faery and Fayery) he sought "connotations older and considerably darker"., p. 85
