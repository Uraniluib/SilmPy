:Because Ori was made the youngest of the 13 Dwarves in the Hobbit films, Kíli is presumably the second youngest. He also comes to have an infatuation with Elves of Mirkwood Tauriel (a character made up exclusively for the films). When struck with a poisoned arrow by Bolg during the Companys escape from the Wood-elves custody via wine barrels, it is she who ultimately heals him with Athelas. Due to said injury, Thorin did not allow him to journey with the others up to the Lonely Mounatin from Lake-town. Óin and Fíli then both opted to also stay behind in order to look after him. As he and the other Dwarves make their way to the Lonely Mountain after Smaugs demise, Kíli shares a tender moment with Tauriel, and gives her the talisman that his mother had given to him. In the Battle of Five Armies, he assists Thorin (along with Fíli and Dwalin) in attempting to kill the Orcs army leader Azog on Ravenhill. However, after witnessing Azog kill his brother, he goes into a rage, attempting to charge the Pale Orc, only to instead come across Tauriel getting severely beaten by Bolg, and proceeds to attack him. Kíli is stabbed to death by Bolg, and a heartbroken Tauriel returns the talisman to his lifeless hand before leaving his side.
