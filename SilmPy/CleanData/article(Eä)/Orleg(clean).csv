Orleg was an outlaw of Túrin band of men in the First Age. He was a member of the Gaurwaith or Wolf-men who hunted in the woods of Taeglin. When the group passed south under the leadership of Túrin they came upon a group of Orcs who were raiding southward. Túrin and Orleg were scouting the land when they were discovered by the Orcs and hunted westward toward the wilds of Nargothrond. There Orleg was slain by many arrows but Túrin escaped and it was a long road to return to the outlaws camp., pp. 110-111
