The Sea of Núrnen also known as Lake Nurnen was an inland sea in Mordor.
The lake was fed by all four (unnamed) major water courses that traversed most of Mordor, before flowing into Nurnen., entry "Nurnen"General Map of Middle-earth
It held bitter water not suitable for drinking, but the area around it, Nurn, was fertile enough (watered by a river system coming from the Ephel Dúath) to feed the entire armies of Sauron.
==Etymology==
Núrnen is glossed as "sad-water"., p. 457 J.R.R. Tolkien also suggested the form Nûrnen ("death, dead water"), and noted the related Sindarin word gurth ("death")., p. 87
The name is commonly understood to be Sindarin,, p. 457
 consisting of the elements Nurn#Etymology + nen ("water").
==Commentary==
In The Atlas of Middle-earth, Karen Wynn Fonstad assumed that the Sea of Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were the remnants of the inland Sea of Helcar. The atlas was however published before The Peoples of Middle-earth, where it was revealed that the Sea of Rhûn existed already in the First Age, as an apparently different body of water than the Sea of Helcar.
