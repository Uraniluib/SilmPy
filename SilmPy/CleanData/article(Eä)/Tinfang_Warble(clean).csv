Tinfang, whom the children call Tinfang Warble, is a creature mentioned in The Book of Lost Tales and in the poem Tinfang Warble (poem).
Vairë (wife of Lindo) tells to Eriol about Tinfang Warble, a spirit who is half fay of Palúrien and half Elf (Gnome or Solosimpi). He was a flautist whose fluting had an enchantment, and the stars twinkled according to his notes. Not even the Solosimpi could rival his fluting.
He led the Elves forth with his piping, and could be heard in the Great Lands and sometimes also in Alalminórë. Eriol also heard him., p. 94 ff
== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
Tinfang Gelion is mentioned in the Lay of Leithian as being one of the greatest of the minstrels of the Elves, beside Maglor and next to Daeron., p. 174

==Etymology==
The meaning of Tinfang is "star-beard" (from tinu "spark, little star" + fang "beard"; found in The Etymologies of The Lost Road). He apparently was one of those few elves who grew beards during the first age of their life, like Mahtan.
Gelion can also be found in several other compounds.
== Inspiration ==
His name probably comes from an earlier poem Tolkien penned named Tinfang Warble (poem), about a fairy-bird.
