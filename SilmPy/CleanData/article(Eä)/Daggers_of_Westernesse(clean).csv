The Daggers of Westernesse were weapons that Tom Bombadil brought out of the mound in which Frodo Baggins and his friends had been imprisoned.  Each dagger had a long, leaf-shaped blade, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold.  They had black sheaths of an unknown metal, light and strong, adorned with fiery stones.  Despite their great age they were sharp and unrusted by time.
==History==
The daggers were created by the Dúnedain of Cardolan during their war against the Witch-king.  They were made for fighting forces sent from Angmar.  After the fall of Cardolan, at least four of these daggers ended up in the tomb of the last prince of that realm who fell in .
On 28 September  Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took became lost in the Barrow-downs and were captured by one of the Barrow-wights and imprisoned in the tomb.  Frodo was able to call Tom Bombadil to their aid, and he opened the tomb and drove the wight away.  Tom gave each of them a dagger from the tomb and told them their history.
Frodos dagger was broken by the Witch King at the Ford of Bruinen.
Merry laid his sword in the lap of King Théoden on 6 March  offering service to him.  The king gladly made Merry an esquire of Rohan of the household of Meduseld.
When Pippin came before Denethor in Minas Tirith on 9 March he offered his sword to the Steward in token of service.  Denethor smiled at first but was impressed by the dagger, recognizing it as coming from his own Dúnedain of Arnor.
On 15 March during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Merry stabbed the Witch-king in the back of the knee with his dagger, which enabled Éowyn to thrust her sword into his face.

The dagger that Merry stabbed into the Witch-king had a power beyond mere metal, for it broke the spell that held the spirits body together.  However, after Merrys blow the blade of the dagger writhed and withered, vanishing like a dry branch in a fire. Thus while the blade was created centuries before to battle against the forces of Angmar, it contributed to the demise of the Witch-king.

==Inspiration==
Swords that dwindle can be seen in the Volsungasaga and the Nibelungenlied. In Beowulf (poem), the sword melts "like ice" after decapitating Grendel and his mother.
