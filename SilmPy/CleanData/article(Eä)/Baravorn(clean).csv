Baravorn is the translation into Sindarin of the Hobbitish name Ranugad. Aragorn addressed Gaffer Gamgee as such in the Kings Letter.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), Sauron Defeated, "The Epilogue"
==Etymology==
The first element is bar, "home". The second element, avorn, is unclear. Though it is usually taken to be related to boron, " steadfast",Carl F. Hostetter, "The Kings Letter, An Historical and Comparative Analysis", in Vinyar Tengwar 31 (September 1993), pages 12-34., it could also be related to the root ABA, indicating a reluctance to leave.
