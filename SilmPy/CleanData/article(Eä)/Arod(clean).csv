Arod was a light horse of Rohan. It bore a Knight of Rohan in Éomers éored that engaged the Orcs outside Fangorn Forest. His rider was lost during the skirmish, but Arod himself survived and remained with the rest of the éored on their way back. In the Wold, Éomer gave him to Legolas. 
Arod served his new rider faithfully, and for much of this time, Arod carried also Legolass friend Gimli. At the Paths of the Dead Legolas spoke Elvish to calm the beast so that it would enter the Dark Door. Presumably he bore Legolas on his way throughout the War of the Ring and during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields., entry "Arod"

In The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Arod is played by a white stallion named Percy. According to Orlando Bloom, it was the friendliest horse on the set.
