Dor Dínen was a small, roughly triangular region to the east of Nan Dungortheb that lay between the upper courses of the rivers Esgalduin and Aros. It was crossed by a road passing from the stone bridge of Iant Iaur on Esgalduin to the ford of the Arossiach on Aros. Its southern edge met the forests of Doriath, so that during the First Age it bordered on the magical Girdle of Melian that prevented entry into Thingols woods.
==Etymology==
Dor Dínen is Sindarin and comes from dor "land" and dínen "silent".
