Grof is a Dwarves from the Blue Mountains in The Lord of the Rings: War in the North. He appears on the marketplace of Bree, where he sells several goods. He was asked by a Bree-men, Otto Aster, to sell weapons to him, so he could arm the towns of Bree-land. Grof originally refused, but after Eradan (video game character), Andriel and Farin (video game character) talked with him, on the request of Otto, he changed his view. Grof then returned to his home in the Blue Mountains to forge weapons for the Bree-landers.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Forewarned is Forearmed
