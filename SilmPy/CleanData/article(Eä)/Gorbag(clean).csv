Gorbag was the captain of the Uruk-hai of Minas Morgul. He served the Nazgûl who dwelt in the Dead City.  
==History==
During the peak of the War of the Ring, the Two Watchers exhibited unease because a Hobbits, Frodo Baggins, had passed by them. Gorbag and a patrol then, left Minas Morgul and were sent to Cirith Ungol where Shagrat was in command.
On 13 March  Gorbag and Shagrat came across Frodo, now paralyzed by Shelob. They ordered Frodo carried back into the Tower of Cirith Ungol as their prisoner.  
During their return to the tower Samwise Gamgee, who was wearing the The One Ring, overheard them talking. It quickly became apparent that Gorbag was the more observant of the two, and noticed that the paralyzed halflings cords were cut, meaning that he had a companion: Shagrat said that the Nazgûl were uneasy and that something nearly slipped, and Gorbag corrected him saying that something had slipped; Shagrat pointed out that Shelob got the halfling, but Gorbag pointed out that he was not alone, as someone else cut the cords from Frodo. Shagrat dismissed Gorbags reasoning by claiming that he always took a gloomy view.  Shagrat, who had been in the tower longer, was able to tell Gorbag that Frodo was not dead.
On 14 March the two Orc leaders stripped Frodo of his possessions.  Upon discovering Frodos Mithril#The Mithril Coat Gorbag tried to keep it, which provoked a fight between the underlings of the two leaders.  Gorbag knifed Shagrat, who in return attempted to throttle him. Later he attempted to stab Shagrat with a broken spear but Shagrat, hearing him, then stabbed him in the throat and trampled on his body.
