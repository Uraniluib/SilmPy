Bruithwir was the father of Fëanor in The Book of Lost Tales Part One., p. 145 J.R.R. Tolkien toyed with the idea of him being Fëanors brother or his son, but chose to make him his father., p. 155 Fëanors father in the later versions of the legendarium, Finwë, was already in existence but was unrelated to Fëanor., p. 132
== History ==
On the last day of the feast of Double Mirth, Morgoth went to Sirnúmen, where many of the Noldor lived at that time, and killed those guarding the treasures. He killed Bruithwir and seized the Silmarils.
His tomb was known as the Mound of the First Sorrow, which was so named because of all the sorrow that Bruithwirs death was to achieve., p. 149-50
