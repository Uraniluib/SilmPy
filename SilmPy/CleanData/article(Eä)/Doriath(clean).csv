Doriath (Sindarin, pron. ) was the land of the Sindar.  It was called the Fenced Land, for its queen, Melian, put a girdle of enchantment about it, so that none could enter without King Thingols permission.
==Geography==
Doriath was a realm of forests about the great river Sirion, with in it the forests Neldoreth (also Taur-na-Neldor, the northern Beeches forest), Nivrim (also West-march, an oak forest), and Forest of Region. Additionally, the forests of Brethil and Nan Elmoth were held as part of Doriath, but these last two lay outside the Girdle of Melian. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also High King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the Gelion to Belegaer.
==History==
The Vanyar and Noldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had been ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then their lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them a part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves, and when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.
Doriath was originally named Doriath#Etymology, but in the last years before the rising of the Sun, attacks by Orcs and other Morgoths creatures began to increase in Beleriand, and Melian fenced the forests of Neldoreth, Region, and Nivrim. Thingol then called all the Sindar to Doriath, but many remained in the wild. After the First Battle of Beleriand, many Green-elves removed to Doriath.
Eöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid the sword Anglachel for it.
The Dwarves of Belegost and Nogrod were contracted to build the halls of Menegroth, which became Thingols capital.
When the Noldor returned to Middle-earth after the rising of the Sun, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the children of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.
When later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but at Finrods request the Haladin were allowed to live in Brethil.
Beren, son of Barahir and lord of the House of Bëor, passed through the Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth. There Thingols daughter Lúthien fell in love with him. After the Quest for the Silmarils the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol, Beren, and Thingols captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the beast.
Túrin was sent to Doriath, and lived there until he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and sister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.
Húrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of Finrods realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamír, the Dwarves Necklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol, and slew him, stealing the necklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with her the protective Girdle.
Doriath was briefly restored under Beren and Lúthiens son Dior, but he was attacked and killed by the sons of Fëanor in the Second Kinslaying. Afterwards Doriath remained abandoned until it was sunk along with most of the rest of Beleriand.
==Etymology==
Doriath is a Sindarin name meaning "Land of the Fence" or "Land of the Girdle of Melian". The name consists of the elements dôr + iâth., pp. 370, 378
The earlier name of Doriath, Eglador, probably means either "Land of the Forsaken" or "Land of the Elves" in Sindarin.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Artanor ("The Land Beyond") was in early versions of the legendarium the name for what was later called Doriath.J.R.R. Tolkien; Christopher Tolkien (ed), The Book of Lost Tales
