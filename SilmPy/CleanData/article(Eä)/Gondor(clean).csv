Gondor was the South Kingdom of the Númenóreans in Middle-earth, established soon after the downfall of Númenor by Isildur and his brother Anárion. Their father Elendil, who ruled the North Kingdom Arnor, held the overlordship of the realm, however. Though it waned in power over time and the line of its Kings failed, Gondor survived to the end of the Third Age, and had an instrumental role in the War of the Ring. After the defeat of Sauron, Gondor was ruled by Aragorn, Heir of Isildur. Gondor was the seat of the Dominion of Men in the beginning of the Fourth Age, and many of the tales and legends of the earlier Ages of the Children of Ilúvatars of Middle-earth come from the lore and history it preserved.
== History ==
=== Early History ===
Before the Downfall of Númenor, the region that would become Gondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mingled with the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them into Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. The land on which Gondor was founded was more fertile than the more northerly areas of Middle-earth, and therefore it already had a fairly large population and settlements, including a well-established haven, Pelargir founded by the Faithful Númenóreans in the year  of the Second Age.
The refugees from Númenor led by Isildur and Anárion were given a warm reception upon their arrival by those Númenóreans colonists. Those north of the river Anduin accepted Elendils claim to kingship over them, being a heir of the Faithful Lords of Andúnie. South of the Great River, however, there were also-newly-exiled Black Númenóreans, descendants of the Kings Men of Númenor, who opposed the Faithful, and therefore did not recognize Elendils claim. Much of Gondors early history was marked by conflict with the Black Númenóreans.
Image:Ted Nasmith - The White Tree.jpg - The White TreeAfter their arrival and acceptance by the people, Isildur and Anárion put themselves to the task of ordering their realm. Isildur took the area then known as Arnen (later Ithilien), p. 17 and built the tower of Minas Ithil near Mordor as a threat to the Mordor, and within its walls he planted a seedling of the Nimloth of Númenor of Númenor that he had taken before its burning. Anárion raised the tower of Minas Anor on the other side of Anduins floodplain as a bulwark against the Wild Men. In between their cities, the brothers founded Osgiliath, their capital, from which they jointly reigned; these three cities also housed three of the palantíri, the Seeing Stones that the Faithful had taken with them from Númenor, to maintain contact with Elendil and the other areas under their control.
=== First Conflict with Sauron ===
The Dúnedain were at first unaware that Sauron, who had been taken as a prisoner to Númenor before its destruction, had survived the disastrous Downfall. However, not long after the kingdoms cities were built, the awakening of the fires of Orodruin signalled his return. At that time, the Men of Gondor first called the mountain Amon Amarth, or Mount Doom. Soon after, Sauron launched an attack on Minas Ithil, which forced Isildur into a retreat. Sauron took the fortress and burned the White Tree that had grown there, but Isildur saved one of its seedlings and took it and his family on a ship down the Anduin. He sailed to the north to confer with Elendil about these events. Anárion remained in Gondor and continued to hold Osgiliath. He also managed to push back Saurons forces to the mountain range of Ephel Dúath, but Sauron began to gather reinforcements, among whom were a large number of Black Númenóreans, and the Men of Gondor knew that their realm was in great danger of being destroyed unless aid came.
=== The War of the Last Alliance ===
Elendil reacted to the threat of Sauron by combining forces with Gil-galad the Elves-king to make the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Their armies marched south-east from Arnor and Gil-galads realm of Lindon. Supported by the forces of Gondor, Lórinand, Mirkwood and the dwarves of Moria, the Alliance fought a great battle on the plain of Dagorlad north of Mordor. The armies of Elendil and Gil-galad were victorious, and entered Mordor itself, where they laid a siege on Saurons Tower of Siege of Barad-dûr for seven years. During this time, Anárion was killed by a rock thrown from the Tower that broke his helm. The siege ended when Sauron himself emerged from Barad-dûr to fight the Alliance. Gil-galad and Elendil attacked and destroyed Sauron, though they themselves were slain the process.
=== Gondor in the Beginning of the Third Age ===
====Rebuilding====
After the battle, during which the long Second Age came to an end, Isildur built a secret tomb for Elendil on the mountain Amon Anwar. He also aided Anárions son Meneldil, who was now King, in reorganizing Gondor. Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree that he had saved in Minas Ithil, and brought to Minas Anor (later known as Minas Tirith), and it endured for several centuries. After these acts, Isildur left Gondor in the third year of the Third Age with the intent of ruling his fathers kingdom of Arnor. He Disaster of the Gladden Fields.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), Unfinished Tales, "The Disaster of the Gladden Fields"
==== Gondor Prospers ====
After the war, Gondors power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted by an Easterlings invasion in Third Age 492). Its power would continue to grow into the 9th century of the Third Age.  While the power of Gondors sister kingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various successor states, Gondors greatest glory was yet to come.
==== Gondors Golden Age ====
File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA1050.jpgGondors power reached its Golden Age under the four "Ship-kings": Tarannon Falastur, Eärnil I, Ciryandil, and Hyarmendacil I.
The reign of Tarannon was an unhappy one: he married Berúthiel, nefarious and loveless. Unlike her husband, she hated the Sea, its smells and its sounds. Mystery began to surround her as she used her cats to spy on the Gondorian nobility, and paranoia and fear rose. After much ado, Tarannon banished her from Gondor, setting her on an adrift ship with her cats. The ship was last seen passing Umbar in the South., note 7  Because he exiled his wife, Tarannon died childless, and the kingship went to hsi nephew Eärnil I. But not all went ill for Tarannon. Around , Tarannon captured the land of Harandor, and took the name Falastur, meaning Lord of Coasts.
But Gondor was not the supreme lord of the coasts as Tarannon boasted, the haven of Umbar stood in their way of complete domination.  So in 933, Eärnil I defeated the Umbarim, seizing control of the seas.  Even though Gondor held unrivaled control of the seas, Eärnil I was lost at sea and was never seen again. The exiled nobility of Umbar sought to depose the newly established Gondorian control of Umbar.  They mustered a Haradrim army and besieged the city. In hopes of relieving the siege, Ciryandil I led an army into Harad, but in 1149 he died fighting the Haradrim.
In the reign of the powerful king Hyarmendacil I Gondor reached the height of its power. During Hyarmendacils reign Gondors borders reached their furthest extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn; south to the Harnen and all the coast up to the cape of Umbar; as far north as Celebrant; and west towards Greyflood. Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of peace due to its military might. The Men of the Vales of Anduin as well as the Haradrim acknowledged its authority and overlordship, with the Kings of Harad paying homage.
Rómendacil II built on the northern approach to Nen Hithoel the giant pillars Argonath to mark the northern border of Gondor following a great victory over the Easterlings in .
=== The Decline of Gondor ===
After Rómendacil IIs reign, decadence spread under the kings of Gondor and a long period of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals). Three great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the Third Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline:  the Kin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a tribe of Easterlings), one of series of conflicts in the Wainrider/Balchoth War.  
==== The Kin-strife ====
In the 15th century a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the nation apart.  The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother was of the Northmen.  Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of King Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondors naval forces who possessed some royal blood.  Eldacars son was slain, and Eldacar fled north.  Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir.  During his ten year rule he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of his old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the interior provinces were ignored and left to rot.  Eldacar then returned with an army of his Northmen kinsmen, and they were joined by armies of Gondorians from interior provinces such as Anórien.  Osgiliath was devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its palantíri lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but Castamirs sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great port of Gondor.  They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined with the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their descendants died out.
==== The Great Plague ====
In Third Age 1636 the Great Plague struck and the White Tree of Gondor died.  This Plague was no localized event:  the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth, reaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in the North. King Tarondor (King of Gondor) found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved the capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During this time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding against the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned.  It is believed that had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at this time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondors enemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was capable of mounting new offensives.
==== The Invasion of the Wainriders ====
The first invasion of the Wainriders began  during the reign of King Narmacil II, following the sapping of Gondors strength by the plague.  The spirit of Sauron in the East stirred up the forces of the Wainriders to attack the lands of Gondor and her allies.  The Wainriders were stronger than any other horde of Easterlings before, and so in 1856, on the fields of Rhovanion, the Wainriders defeated the forces of Gondor and the Northmen, killing Narmacil II and enslaving Rhovanion.  During the enslavement of Rhovannion, the Nazgûl entered Mordor.  But the Gondorians would not sit idle, while their allies to the north were suffering under the Wainriders.  In 1899 Kingn Calimehtar led a revot in Rhovanion, and defeated the Wainriders in the Battle of Dagorlad.  
 The King Ondoher took council with Araphant the king of Arthedain. The kings realized that one force was beset on destroying the kingdoms of the Dunedain.  For a long time it had lain dormant, but in the weakness of both kingdoms, it attacked.  The Kingdoms allied against the power, and Prince Arvedui of Arthedain married Firiel the daughter of Ondoher.  
After licking their wounds for 45 years the Wainriders returned with allies from Khand and Harad .  The Wainriders came in the north from Rhovanion and the men of Harad and Khand attacked from the South.  The Wainriders destroyed the Northern Army of Gondor, but in the south Gondor defeated the Southrons at the River Poros.  Their Captain Eärnil gathered the remnants of the northern army, and went north to challenge the Wainriders.  In the Battle of the Camp Eärnil surprised the Wainriders, while they were celebrating their victory.
=== The Line of the Kings Fails ===
==== Reunification Rejected ====
In 1944, Gondor also faced a constitutional crisis when King Ondoher was slain in a previous battle with both his sons. Prince Arvedui, son of King Araphant of Arthedain and Ondohers son-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant blood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arveduis claim lay mainly in the reintroduction of the old Númenórean law of accession, which stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If the law was reintroduced, then Arveduis wife Fíriel, Ondohers daughter and last remaining child would become Ruling Queens of Númenor, making their descendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put weight behind his claim as he was Isildurs heir. The Council of Gondor recognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but they dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of Anárion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a millennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of both Isildur and Anárion.

Eärnil lay his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar Umbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he had gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the Wainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward Pelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of succession, intervened in favour of Gondors victorious general who would rule as Eärnil II.
==== The Last Heir of Anárion ====
During the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil IIs heir Eärnur led Gondors forces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the Lord of the Nazgûl.  Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnurs horse was terrified and fled the battle against his wishes.  By the time he mastered his horse and return, the Witch-king had fled.  Glorfindel the Elf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord of the Nazgûl because "never by the hand of man shall he fall".  
Eärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (Tower of the Sun).  During this time, the Ringwraiths captured Minas Anors sister city, Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon), renaming it Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery) and taking it as their lair.  Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) as a result.  The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly sent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat, taunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during the Battle of Fornost.  Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and rode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the challenge.  They were never heard from again.  So ended the Line of Anárion.
=== The Stewards of Gondor ===
==== The Ruling Stewards ====
The realm was governed by a long line of hereditary Stewards after the disappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that the last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be accepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed, and Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would surely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would swear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only an heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor there was no one who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the northern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not considered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without having the title.
==== Cirion and Eorl ====
Image:Ted Nasmith - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl.jpg - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl
In Third Age 2510, when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one of its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the Balchoth invaded Gondor with massive force. Gondors army marched to fight the Balchoth but were cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the Limlight.
Messengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe which lived in the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers to reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor, however, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of Calenardhon north of the Ered Nimrais from the Gap of Rohan at the southern end of the Misty Mountains, Fangorn Forest, rivers Limlight to river Anduin, western Emyn Muil and the Mering Stream, where they established the kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A perpetual alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath Eorl swore to Cirion.
In  King Déor asked the help of Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor) to drive off the Dunlendings from the occupied Ring of Isengard, but a renewed war against the Orcs prevented the Steward from fulfilling the Oath.
Southern Gondor was assailed by three great fleets from Umbar and Harad and Beren (Steward of Gondor) spent much of his rule fighting the Corsairs of Umbar. In the meantime, during the Long Winter of  - , Rohan came under attack from the Dunlendings, so neither nation could help the other, until captain Beregond, Berens son, repeled the invaders. Therefore when Saruman suddenly appeared and requested leave to dwell in Isengard, Beren gladly gave the Wizard the key of Orthanc. By the time of Beregond, Gondor started recovering its strength.
Upon the death of Belecthor, the White Tree of Gondor also died, but was left standing "until the King comes"., p. 206
In , when Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King Folcwine of Rohan fulfilled the Oath and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Steward Túrin II won a victory at the Crossings of Poros. Since then, Gondor withdrew from Ithilien and only the Rangers of Ithilien remained with special refuges for them, and a fortification on Cair Andros.
It was near the end of Turgon (Steward of Gondor)s rule, in  , when Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding Barad-dûr. Ecthelion II strengthened Pelargir and refortified Cair Andros. Under his service, the stranger Thorongil, severely damaged the Corsairs fleet at Umbar in a Surprise Attack on Umbar.
=== War of the Ring===
File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA3019.jpg
In 3019, during the War of the Ring, Gondor was the strongest of the free nations that opposed Sauron, and thus, its defeat was his primary strategic goal in the war.  Gondor faced an all out attack on its capital Minas Tirith in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Although nearly defeated, the Rohirrim once again turned the tide of battle, and helped win the war, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West then carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint to distract Saurons attention from Frodo Bagginss quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Saurons destruction and the allies ultimate victory.
After the second and final defeat of Sauron the Kingship was restored, Aragorn became king of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor. 
Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, was to retain the office of steward (though not ruling), and was made Prince of Ithilien, which had been reconquered from the forces of Mordor.J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King, "The Steward and the King" Faramir would serve as the Kings representative during absence or illness, and became the chief counsellor of the Council of Gondor.
==Geography==
Initially, Gondor was comprised of the lands to the North and South of the White Mountains, but Calenardhon was gifted to the Éothéod in Third Age 2510. Gondors close proximity to Saurons land was the catalyst of many battles and skirmishes, but its location also gave the Gondorians more ability to protect the other regions of Middle-earth from the Dark Lord and his servants.
===Regions===
Gondor was divided between several nearly autonomous regions. These were the following:
* Ithilien, the lands across the Anduin from Minas Tirith
* Anórien, surrounding Minas Tirith and north of Ered Nimrais
* Lossarnach, in the mountain vales south-west of Minas Tirith 
* Lebennin, the land between Lossarnach and the Bay of Belfalas 
* Belfalas, peninsula jutting out from the southern coast of Gondor 
* Dor-en-Ernil, ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth
* Lamedon, north of the Ringló
* Ringló Vale, between Lamedon and Belfalas
* Anfalas, or the Langstrand, in the south-west
* Morthond, south of Erech
*Pinnath Gelin, the hills north of Anfalas and east of the river Lefnui
* Ethir Anduin, south of the mouths of the Anduin
The long cape of Andrast was not populated.
Additionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain points in its history:
* South Gondor, which was contested between Gondor and Harad
* Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan
* Enedwaith, the timberlands of Gondor, which were never really populated and soon abandoned
*  Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but under Gondorian influence at certain times during the Third Age
* Umbar, which was retaken by the Corsairs of Umbar and the Haradrim
* Haradwaith, tributary of Gondor for a while
===Cities===
Cities in Gondor included:
* Calembel
* Dol Amroth, a city on the coast of Belfalas
* Linhir
* Minas Tirith (originally named Minas Anor), City of the Kings
* Osgiliath, city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin, largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age
* Pelargir
* Tarnost (debatable)J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, The War of the Ring, "The Second Map"
===Fortresses and outposts===
Additionally, Gondor used the following locations as military strongholds at certain points in its history, many of which Mordor later took:
* The outposts of Amon Hen and Amon Lhaw on Emyn Muil probably had small garrisons
* Isengard, the fortress of Isengard, later granted to Saruman
* The Gondorian fortress later known as Hornburg, guarding the Helms Deep
* The Towers of the Teeth, built by the Gondorians to keep watch over Mordor
* The Tower of Cirith Ungol guarding the pass of Cirith Ungol
* The castle that came to be called Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard the Ephel Dúath
* Minas Ithil, conquered by Mordor and renamed Minas Morgul by the Gondorians
* Tharbad to the north, held by both Gondor and Arnor but abandoned and later ruined after Gondor retreated from Enedwaith
* Umbar, a harbour in the south which was contested by the Haradrim and lost and reclaimed several times
==Languages==
As the Gondorians came from Númenor, so came their language: Westron, or the Common Speech, was the main language of the people of Gondor. Though the source of Westron lay in Pelargir,J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F, "Of Men" the clearest form, without any accent, was spoken in Minas Tirith.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 193 (dated 2 November, 1956) This style was nobler and more antique than other dialects, and this was the Westron the Elves adopted.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 144 (dated 25 April, 1954) In reverence of the mighty lords of Númenor of old, Eldarin was spoken by nobility. Quenya was known to the learned, and Sindarin was used to be polite, especially by those of high Númenóreans blood.J.R.R. Tolkien, Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 347 (dated 17 December, 1972) However, especially the Sindarin contained several Gondor Sindarin.J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), Unfinished Tales, "Cirion and Eorl", note 49
==Etymology==
In earlier times, it was called the South Kingdom, or Hyaralondie, Hyallondie and Turmen Hyallondiéva in Quenya, and Arthor na Challonnas in Sindarin from the Númenórean point of view: the elements londie and lonnas mean "harbour, landing".
The name Gondor was likely adopted from the lesser peoples terminology and translates from Sindarin as "Stone-land", from the words gond, "stone", and (n)dor, "land". The (generally not used) Quenya form of the name was Ondonóre. Gondor received its name because of the abundance of stone in the Ered Nimrais, and the usage of it in great stone cities, statues, and monuments, such as Minas Tirith and the Argonath. 
In Rohan, it was known as Stoningland (a modernization of Old English Stāning-(land), p. 776), and Ghân-buri-Ghân of the Drúedain also recognized their use of stone.
==Inspiration==
The history and civilization of Gondor has been compared to historical elements of the real world.
===Italy===
Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955) about an impending trip in 1955, Tolkien identified Gondor as Wikipedia:Italy., p. 462
===Egypt===
Tolkien himself likened Gondor in a degree to ancient Egypt, in terms of how Gondorians constructed gigantic stone structures, and the Crown of Gondor being similar to the Wikipedia:Pschent., p. 281 Notably, some "scholars" claimed that ancient Egypt was a colony of Atlantis,Wikipedia:Ignatius L. Donnelly, http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4032 Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882), Part V, Chapter II: The Egyptian Colony much like how Gondor was a survival of Númenor (although it is unknown if Tolkien considered this aspect).
===Byzantine Empire===
In online discussions, many Tolkien fandom have entertained the idea that Gondor is comparable to the Wikipedia:Byzantine Empire, and Tolkien himself referred to Minas Tirith as a "Byzantine City"., p. 570 Some of the parallels noted between Gondor and the Byzantine Empire are:Miryam Librán-Moreno, "Byzantium, New Rome!: Goths, Langobards, and Byzantium in The Lord of the Rings", in Tolkien and the Study of His Sources (edited by Jason Fisher
Gondor is the south-eastern portion of Elendils original kingdom. The Byzantine Empire was the Eastern remnant of the Roman Empire. The Wikipedia:Western Roman Empire eventually withered and dissolved, like Arnor, while the Byzantine Empire endured, although in declined state. Their geographical role is also comparable as the Byzantine Empire encircled the Mediterranean while Gondor occupied the region around the Bay of Belfalas; both were threatened by Easterlings and Haradrim adversaries. The Byzantine Empire absorbed several "barbaric" peoples like the Wends and Slavs, much like Gondor did with the Northmen and other Middle Men. 
As a final note, the last Byzantine Emperor, Wikipedia:Constantine_XI_Palaiologos#Legacy, remained in legend and folklore as the Wikipedia:King in the mountain whose messianic ressurection and return would signal the restoration of the Empire. This parallels the fate of Earnur and Gondors interregnum period until the "Return of the Aragorn" who Reunited Kingdom. However unlike the Byzantine Empire, Gondor did not fall.
