There were many battles between the Elves of Beleriand and the forces of Morgoth in the centuries making up the First Age.
These battles are often referred to as the Wars of Beleriand or Battles of Beleriand, but also as the War of the Jewels as the Silmarilli were behind them all but the First Battle of Beleriand.
== Significant Battles ==
The following are the major battles in this long, extended conflict.  Morgoth ever used Angband as a mighty fortress, and the base from which to launch his devastating attacks.  While the Ñoldor had their victories, the Doom of Mandos always hung over their efforts. Many Men fell in these battles on both sides, and for a long time after the Elves had scorn for the Houses who supported Morgoth.
#The First Battle of Beleriand was fought before the Noldor arrived, and was fought by the Sindar and Laiquendi.
#The Second Battle was the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, or Battle-under-Stars, fought by the Ñoldor following Fëanor and his Sons of Fëanor.
#*During this battle the Battle of the Lammoth was fought by the host of Fingolfin.
#The Third Battle was the Dagor Aglareb, or Glorious Battle, which led to the Siege of Angband.
#*Various minor battles were fought during the Siege which are not counted among the majors.
#The Fourth Battle was the disastrous Dagor Bragollach, or Battle of Sudden Flame, in which Ard-galen burned and many Ñoldor, including Fingolfin, were slain.
#The Fifth Battle was the Nirnaeth Arnoediad or Battle of Unnumbered Tears, in which the Union of Maedhros was utterly broken by Morgoth.
#*The Fall of the Falas, in which the havens of Brithombar and Eglarest were sacked and fell, took place after the Nírnaeth.
#*The Sack of Nargothrond, where the city was destroyed by Glaurung and his Orcs.
#*The Fall of Gondolin, in which Morgoths hosts besieged and destroyed the Ñoldor and their citadel of Gondolin, killing King Turgon.
#The Sixth and Last Battle of Beleriand was the War of Wrath, which defeated Morgoth, ended the First Age of Arda and destroyed Beleriand.
