Oromë was a Valar and one of the Aratar, also known as the Huntsman of the Valar and the Great Rider. 
==Attributes==
Oromë delights in hunting monsters and evil creatures, riding on his steed Nahar and blowing his great horn Valaróma. He loves horses and dogs as well as all trees and forests. In Yavannas woods in Valinor he trains his folk and beasts for hunting.
He was the brother of Nessa and the husband of Vána.
==History==
During the Years of the Trees, after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in Aman, Oromë was the last who came to Valinor, and even then he still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion. He visited Middle-earth during the Sleep of Yavanna, hunting monsters and fell creatures and the shadows fled temporarily until he left.
Thus, he was responsible for finding the Elves when they awoke at Cuiviénen, and was the first to name them the Eldar. Seeking to ensure their safety, Oromë accompanied the Elves from Cuiviénen to Beleriand. Being a powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Morgoth.
Because Oromë was the only Vala who travelled in Middle-earth during the Elder Days, it was believed, even during the Third Age that the wild cows found near the Sea of Rhun descended from his Kine of Araw. 
Béma was the name used by the Northmen for Oromë. As the great huntsman and horseman of the Valar, he and his steed Nahar were known to the horse-loving people of Rohan, who claimed that their great horses, the Mearas, had ancestors brought out of Aman by Béma himself.
==Etymology==
The name Oromë is said to be derived from his Valarin name Arōmēz. 
His name is translated as "Horn-blowing" and "Sound of Horns"., pp. 82, 85
Araw () was the Sindarin form of the name of the Oromë., p. 96, p. 10
Tauron was an epithet used by the Sindar for Oromë. In the Valaquenta, Tauron is translated as "Lord of Forests". Another translation is "The Forester"., p. 358 (note 21) The language, to which the name pertains, remains non-explicit in J.R.R. Tolkiens texts:
#Quenya word? The root of the word could be taure ("great wood") plus the ending -on. The name would thus have the sense "One of forests".Suggestion by User:Sage
#Sindarin word? This would be suggested by its usage among the Sindar and by the Noldorin form it replaced (see below).
Tolkien used at least two earlier forms of the by-name Tauron:
#Tavros - the form Tauros replaced - used in such early texts as the Lay of Leithian., passim The name is Noldorin, defined as "Chief wood fay the Blue Spirit of the Woods"., p. 69, p. 267The form Tavros cited here from the Parma Eldalamberon 11, is defined as a "proper name". The form tavros (with a minuscule t) is defined as "forest, wooded land".
#Tauros - the form Tauron replaced - is a Noldorin word defined in the The Etymologies as meaning "Forest-Dread" (Sundocarme TAW + GOS)., p. 391
The name Béma is from the Rohirric (J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by the Old English word Wiktionary:beme "trumpet")., p. 153
In Eriols Old English translations, Oromë is referred to as Wáðfréa "Huntinglord", Huntena  fréa "Hunting  Lord and Lord of  Hunters" and Wealdafréa "Lord of Forests". The name Béaming is a translation of Q. Aldaron.
