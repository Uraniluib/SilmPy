1978: The Lord of the Rings (1978 film):

1980: The Return of the King (1980 film)
:The Nine are skull headed demons, who ride winged horses. The Witch-king himself rides a dragon-like creature, and has no face. Only a suspended crown and two red eyes can be seen. The Nazgûl have the Red Eye of Barad-dûr rather than the emblem of Minas Morgul.

2002: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)
:Black Riders form a threat in the Shire-stages of the game, where they need to be avoided by the player (in the persona of Frodo Baggins), and as the end boss for the game (in the persona of Aragorn). They are tall and robed in black, and nothing is seen underneath. 
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:The Nazgûl serve as the suspense in the first half of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

Under their robes, they are pale white ghostly creatures.

2006: The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II:
:A new Ringwraith is introduced in the expansion pack, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king. Morgomir is the "Lieutenant of Carn-Dûm", the right-hand man of the Witch-king, of Black Númenóreans descent. The design is similar to that in Peter Jacksons films: he is hooded and cloaked when he works for the Mordor faction, and white and ghostly when he fights for Angmar.
2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The Nazgûl appear several times throughout the game. Hobbit characters first witness the Black Riders in the Shire during the Prologue. Early in the game one of the Nine wounds a Dúnedain Ranger Amdir with a Morgul-knife, who is later transformed into a Wraith himself, despite the best efforts of Free Peoples. Later, the player attempts to resist the troubles the Nine are spreading in Bree-Land. Various people along their path - from Hobbits, to Men of Bree, to people east of Weathertop - note how the local wildlife became unusually aggressive lately, though few connect it to the influence of Nazgûl.
:As stated in The Fellowship of the Ring, only eight horses of the Wraiths were found along the shores of Bruinen. Glorfindel, Elrond, and his sons all enlist you to find the missing one - and while the horse is eventually found, it is clear that the Nazgûl himself escaped. The player foils his attempts to organize the Trolls of the Trollshaws and pursues him into the Misty Mountains, where the severely weakened Wraith is finally defeated, with his spirit sent back to Mordor.
:During the Fellowships stay in Lothlórien, the Galadhrim Elves launch a military strike against Dol Guldur, to draw the attention of the Eye from the company departing down the Shores of Anduin. At this point, three Nazgûl reside in the fortress; their names are given as "The Black Blade of Lebennin", "The Gloom of Nurn" and the strongest of the three "The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur". A large force of players confronts the Lieutenant and his Fell Beast at the chief tower of Dol Guldur.
:During their travel down the waters of the Great River, Legolas shot and killed a fell shadow in the sky, not knowing it to be a Nazgûl. The player is later able to find the corpse of the fell beast in the Brown Lands and it becomes clear that a Nazgûl is not far - only this time the player cannot receive help from Elrond or Galadriel, who helped him survive the last two encounters. At night, the Wraith ambushes your friends, but the player manages to drive him away with the use of fire. A girl named Nona is wounded in this fight, but the Free Peoples managed to bring her to Lady Galadriel in time to heal the wound. The player later meets the Bane of Rhun in the Blackroot Vale and the Black Blade of Lebennin in Osgiliath. When Minas Tirith is attacked, the Witch-King breaks the gate with Grond (battering ram). 
2009: The Lord of the Rings: Conquest:
:In the Evil Campaign, the Eight Nazgûl bring Witch-King back to life after Sauron reclaims The One Ring.
2011: The Lord of the Rings: War in the North:
:The Nazgûl appear in a flasback during the prologue of the game, in which they attack the Rangers of the North at Sarn Ford, the entrance of the Shire. Later in the flashback their leader, the Witch-king, speaks with Agandaûr.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:In the context of the film adaptation, the Witch-king and the other Ringwraiths were buried in a dungeon in the High Fells of Rhudaur after the Battle of Fornost of Angmar. The Witch-king of Angmar initially appears in Dol Guldur, where he briefly fights Radagast (who also discovers a Sauron#Saurons Return within the fortress) with his Morgul-blade. He drops it and  Radagast takes it with him, ultimately bringing it to Gandalf, who then shows to the White Council in Rivendell. Later, Gandalf, per Galadriels advice, visits the High Fells dungeons and discovers that they had been brought back to life, as their cells were empty, broken open from the inside. Through this investigation, he is convinced that the Necromancer is indeed Sauron.
:During the Attack on Dol Guldur they appeared in armored, ghostly versions of their mortal forms after Galadriel rescues Gandalf From his cage in Dol Guldur. The Nine do battle with Galadriel, Saruman, and Elrond. During a confrontation between Galadriel and Sauron, they are driven to Mordor, with their master eventually following suit.
