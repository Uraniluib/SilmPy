Lindir was an Elf of Rivendell. 
__NOTOC__
== History ==
After Bilbo Bagginss rendition of his Song of EÃ¤rendil, Lindir claimed that he was unable to tell which parts were written by Aragorn, and which by Bilbo himself, explaining that he knew little of Mortals and their ways.
==Etymology==
The name Lindir seems to be composed of lin ("tune") + ndir ("man"), therefore meaning "song man".
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2012-14: The Hobbit (film series):
:Lindir is portrayed by Bret McKenzie. He welcomes Gandalf and the party of Dwarves to Rivendell in place of Elrond, who is hunting, and later reports to Lord Elrond that Thorin and his companions have departed in secret.  McKenzie also appeared in The Lord of the Rings (film series) as an extra dubbed "Figwit" by fans. It is unclear whether that character is intended to be Lindir.
