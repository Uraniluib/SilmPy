Ened was a small island that lay straight out from the Firth of Drengist, southwest of Lammoth and northwest of Nevrast.  The island was roughly four times longer than it was wide, and its long axis lined up with the Firth.  There is no mention of the island in the annals of the First Age so it may have been uninhabited.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the "Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North" in The Silmarillion the island was shown but unnamed.  In The War of the Jewels, Christopher Tolkien said of the second Silmarillion map that over the years it had become covered with alterations and additions of names and features.  On Sheet 1 of this map the island bears the name "Ened" - concerning the name Christopher stated that he could cast no light., p. 181
