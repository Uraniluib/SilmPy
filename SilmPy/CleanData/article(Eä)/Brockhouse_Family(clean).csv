==Etymology==
Brock is an old (up to the end of the 19th century) country word for "badger" and, in that Hobbit name, refers to its building complicated and well-ordered underground dwellings. 
J.R.R. Tolkien noted that English place-names and surnames contain this old word, such as Brockbanks., p. 754
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the fifth version of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings the Brockhouse family did not have any members living in the Shire; instead those that attended Bilbos party were from Combe and were Hobbits that Bilbo had befriended on his travels.
