The Wandering Companies were traveling groups of Elves in Eriador of the Third Age. 
They set out from Rivendell to various destinations, of which only the Tower Hills are known. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee and Peregrin Took encountered one such Wandering Company, led by Gildor, in September . They were on their way back to Rivendell, after having gazed in the Palant√≠ri of the Tower Hills, seeking Varda.
