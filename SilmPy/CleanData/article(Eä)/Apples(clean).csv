Apples were the fruits of apple trees cultivated in the Shire and in Bree-land. Bilbo Baggins served apple-tart to Bifur at the An Unexpected Party.. Before Frodo Baggins left the Shire he noticed how fine the weather had been, such that "the trees were laden with apples".  When Aragorn led the hobbits from Bree, Samwise Gamgee chewed on one of the apples given to him by Nob and Bob at the Prancing Pony.  Apples were so much a part of the diet of Hobbits that Sam recited a proverb: "Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting."  As the party passed the house of the scornful Bill Ferny, Sam chucked an apple at him and struck Bill square on the nose.
Apple trees are not directly mentioned in The Lord of the Rings but one of the men of Bree was Rowlie Appledore, whose last name was an old English word for "apple tree".

The Sindarin translation of the name Peregrin Took is Cordof., pp. 129-31 As Wikipedia:Coxs Orange Pippin is a kind of apple, it has been suggested that cordof refers to a "small red apple".http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókës Sindarin Dictionary (accessed 24 March 2011)
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2001: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:
In the movie Sam does not eat any apples and he does not throw one at Bill Ferny.  However, in Scene 16, "The Nazgûl", when the hobbits start to prepare a breakfast Strider tells them, "Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall."  Startled, Peregrin Took asks, "What about second breakfast?"  Strider says nothing and walks on.  Soon though he tosses an apple from behind a bush, which Meriadoc Brandybuck catches.  A second tossed apple smacks Pippin in the forehead.
