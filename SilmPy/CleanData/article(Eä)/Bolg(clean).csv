2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:
:Bolg is played by Conan Stevens in this film via practical costume. He makes a brief appearance during the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he is seen fighting against Dwalin during the flashback to the battle outside Moria, until he is incapacitated and knocked down. He is, however, never actually identified as being Bolg in the film.While Bolg was redesigned for motion capture performance and recast for the two following films, Conan Stevens does reprise this character as the Keeper of the Dungeons at Dol Guldur in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies who torments Gandalf as he is imprisoned there. The Orc also attempts to reclaim Narya from the Wizards for his Sauron right before being vanquished by Galadriel upon her arrival, though this segment only occurs in the films The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)
2013: The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug:
:Bolg is played by Lawrence Makoare via motion capture in this film. Azog - who survives the War of the Dwarves and Orcs in these films - is summoned to Dol Guldur to become the commander of Saurons Orcs armies. While there, Azog dispatches his son Bolg to take his place in hunting Thorin and Company. With his pack of Orcs, Bolg tracks Thorin and Company through Mirkwood, attacks the Wood-elves as the Company escapes in barrels, and eventually follows the Thorin and Company to Lake-town.
:At Lake-town, Bolg and a team of stealth-Orcs raid Bards home in search of the Dwarves, but find only four. When they attack, they are in turn attacked by two Elves: Legolas and Tauriel. He goes after Legolas, and the two begin a duel (in which the Elf uses Orcrist, the weapon of Thorin). However, the two adversaries prove to be evenly-matched, so Bolg decides to make his retreat. While Legolas is distracted by other Orcs, Bolg withdraws and rides a Warg down a dock. He is then pursued by Legolas, now on a horse.
2014: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies:
:Once again performed via motion capture, Bolg is played by John Tui this time. He is first seen in this film when he meets his father who is leading Saurons forces to capture Lonely Mountain. When he realises Elves of Mirkwood will come to Erebor, Azog sends Bolg to lead a separate Orc army detachment raised in Gundabad. Arriving with an advance force, he aids his father against Thorin Oakenshields commando team on Ravenhill, nearly kills the Elf Tauriel, and slays the Dwarf KÃ­li when he comes to her defense. Soon afterwards, however, he is confronted and killed by Legolas, who drives one of his battle-knives into his head. Bolgs body subsequently falls off the mountain and is crushed by a boulder falling on top of it.
