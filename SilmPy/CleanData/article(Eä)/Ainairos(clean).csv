Ainairos was an Elf of Valinor. He was one of the Solosimpi that escaped the Kinslaying at Alqualondë in which his brother was killed., p. 234
As the result of this, he, along with many of his people, became bitter and resentful of the Noldoli. When Manwë summoned the Valar and the Eldar to a council, Ainairos was the one to speak against the Exiles and for the concealment of Valinor, and the most that were gathered there agreed with him, desiring neither Melko nor the Noldoli to return., p. 234-235
