Belfalas was a region of southern Gondor, encompassing the coast from the mouth of the Anduin to Dol Amroth.
==History==
Belfalas formed a part of Dor-en-Ernil, or the "Princes land". The Prince in question here was the Lord of Dol Amroth, who lived at the city bearing his name.
At the start of the second millennium of the Third Age, a certain Imrazôr the Númenor lived in and ruled over the Belfalas. He married Mithrellas, a Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, and their son Galador became the first Prince of Dol Amroth.
The Belfalas was also home to an old Elf haven named Edhellond. Its chief city was the Princes residence of Dol Amroth.
South of the Belfalas lay a great Bay, which was named after it the Bay of Belfalas.
During the War of the Ring, the Belfalas was raided by the Corsairs of Umbar, and therefore did not send any men to help defend Minas Tirith, until Aragorn liberated the coast with the Grey Company, freeing Gondors southern armies to follow him north to relieve Minas Tirith.
==Etymology==
The name Belfalas consists of bel (a Pre-Númenórean element of unknown meaning) + Sindarin falas ("shore")., p. 15

2014: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:The Havens of Belfalas were an area in the region of Western Gondor. They were located south of the Blackroot Vale via "Tarlangs Crown" and south-west of Lamedon. The "Emyn Ernil" lay to the east, dividing Belfalas from Dor-en-Ernil. During March of , the two bridges to the Emyn Ernil were destroyed, preventing direct travel between the two areas through the hills. The capital was Dol Amroth and other settlements included "Tadrent" and "Ost Lontir". There were two Warning beacons of Gondor in Belfalas, on the north edges of the Emyn Ernil: "Amon Lontir" and "Nendath". The small island "Tol Aduial" was in the bay north of Dol Amroth and the larger island "Tol Fennas" was west of Dol Amroth. A reclusive group of Elves, the "Avorrim", kept watch upon the abandoned haven of Edhellond in secret.
