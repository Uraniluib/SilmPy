Firs were Evergreen trees that grew across the northern parts of Middle-earth, and especially in the upper Vales of Anduin.  On 23 September  Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Peregrin Took encountered firs at midnight in the Green Hill Country.  The hobbits made a fire of fir sticks and cones and slept in angles between a great fir-trees roots.
