Turtle-fish was a legendary race of giant sea monsters, mentioned only in Hobbits verse. The last of the Turtle-fish was named Fastitocalon.
Turtle-fish appeared as treacherous islands, really being monsters capable of drowning seafarers.; see also "Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)" (letter)
==Inspiration==
J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by an Old English bestiary, appearing in the Wikipedia:Exeter Book. The idea of giant marine turtles ultimately derives from Eastern myths, and in the European versions the monster is often confused with whales.
==Other version of the legendarium==
It is never explained whether the turtle-fish was an actual race or just a fictional character for the poem "Fastitocalon (poem)". In an earlier version of the legendarium, Ulmo, Lord of the Waters, uses his giant whale, Uin, to drag Tol EressÃ«a towards Aman. This whale reappears in J.R.R. Tolkiens story Roverandom. It is thinkable that Tolkien, in an early phase of the mythology, imagined the fastitocalon to be another one of Ulmos creatures.
