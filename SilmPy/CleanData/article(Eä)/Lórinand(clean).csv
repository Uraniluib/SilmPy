Lórinand was one of the many old names for the land usually called Lothlórien.
==Etymology==
In a manuscript composed by J.R.R. Tolkien sometime after The Lord of the Rings, Lórinand is said to be a Nandorin name, meaning "valley of gold" (containing the "Elvish word meaning golden light")., note 5
However, Christopher Tolkien notes that in a later manuscript the name Lórinand was reconceptualized as "a transformation, after the introduction of the Mallorn, of a yet older name Lothlórien#Names".
