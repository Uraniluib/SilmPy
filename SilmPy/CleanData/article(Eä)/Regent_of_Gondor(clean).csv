Regent (Quenya. Karma-kundo, "Guardian of the Helm") was a title applied to those granted executive authority in place of a legitimate reigning king.
==Númenorean precedent==
Before the time of Tar-Aldarion, no Kings of Númenor had ever left the Elenna during his reign. When Tar-Aldarion resolved to travel to Middle-earth, the Council of the Sceptre sought a regency to rule in his place. The kings father, Meneldur, refused the regency when offered, and Meneldurs cousin, Hallatan of Hyarastorni, became regent instead.  Ancalimë served as regent on more than one occasion while her father voyaged.Christopher Tolkiens discussion of his fathers notes for the unfinished portions of Aldarion and Erendis
==Gondor==
In all the history of the Kings of Gondor, only one Regent of this kind was ever appointed, Minalcar.
Minalcar was the grandson of Atanatar II and son of Calmacil (King of Gondor). In the closing years of his grandfathers rule, he had become a forceful presence in the royal councils as neither of the Kings sons, Narmacil I nor Calmacil, showed great interest in state affairs. Just a few short years after his uncle Narmacil succeeded the King, he conferred the office of Karma-kundo on Minalcar; from that point he effectively ruled Gondor for no less than sixty-four years, though officially doing so in the Kings name. Minalcar would eventually ascend to the throne of Gondor himself under his better-known name Rómendacil II.
After the death of Ondoher and his sons, Steward Pelendur ruled Gondor briefly between  and  until Earnil I was appointed as Ondohers successor. The Ruling Stewards were effectively "Regents" who ruled Gondor indefinitely in the Kings absence.
==Etymology==
Karma-kundo is translated "Helm-guardian"., p. 260 
In the orthography used in The Lord of the Rings, this name would be written Carma-cundo, since Tolkien usually represented the k-sound with the letter "c".
