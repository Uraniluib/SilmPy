Armenelos the Golden, referred to as City of the Kings, was the capital and (in later years) the largest city of Númenor.
It was situated on a hill in eastern central Númenor, in the district called Arandor, the Kingsland, close to Meneltarma and the haven of Rómenna. Armenelos contained the royal palace, the Kings House, reportedly built with the help of the Maiar, with Nimloth. 
==History==
It was founded as far back as the end of the First Age, when the Edain first migrated to the island. Conceivably Arandor was the first district they settled after landing in a firth that later led to the haven of Rómenna.
Its finishing, together with the coronation of Elros in , marked the beginning of the Númenóreans realm.
In the later years Armelenos became the largest city of the island as Andúnië declined. The Temple was built there by Sauron.
==Etymology==
The name is obviously Quenya and possibly means "royal-heaven-fortress", entry "Armenelos" analyzed as ar- + menel + ost.
The Adûnaic name is Ar-Minalêth, p. 145 which appears to be a direct translation of the Quenya name, analyzed as ar- + minul (Adûnaic name of menel).
At early stages of writing, this city was called by other names: Númenos,, pp. 11, 14, 19, 30 Númar or Nûmar, p. 26 (at first used of what became Númenor)
