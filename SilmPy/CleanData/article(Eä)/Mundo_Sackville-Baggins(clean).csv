Mundo Sackville-Baggins is a character created specifically for The Lord of the Rings Online. 
He was mistakenly identified by the Blackwolds to be the Hobbit carrying the Ring that they were looking for and taken to Bree-land in hopes of selling him to the Nazg没l. He was rescued by Strider and Amdir (Shadows of Angmar), in which Amdir was stabbed by a Nazg没l. After the Nazg没l was driven off, they fled to Archet to recover. Shortly after, Archet was attacked by the Blackwolds and burned down. In the wake, Amdir was taken by the Nazg没l to become a Cargul.
When he returned to the Shire he requested compensation for his treatment at Archet from the Mayor of Michel Delving, Will Whitfoot.
He is the nephew of Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.
