Hawks were the swiftest birds of prey, smaller than Eagles, but just as sharp-eyed. 
==History==
Spirits (creatures) in the shapes of hawks and eagles were the servants of ManwÃ«, continually flying over Middle-earth to gather information for their master. Above many flocks of crebain, Aragorn noticed hawks, flying high in the sky, during the War of the Ring., "The Ring goes South"
==Etymology==
Christopher Tolkien noted that one of two possible readings for the unintelligible entry PHI in The Etymologies could be "hawk" (the other being "haste")., Sundocarme PHI Carl F. Hostetter and Patrick H. Wynne argue that "hawk" is the more likely reading, especially given the onomatopoeic suitability of the form of the base to the cry of a hawk, and the possible relation to the root PHILIK, "small bird"., p. 9 The Quenya word for "hawk" would then be fion, plural fiondi.
In a linguistic manuscript dating from the 1930s, appears the Qenya gloss haro ("hawk")., p. 8
