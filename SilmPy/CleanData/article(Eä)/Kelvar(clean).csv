Kelvar was a name used by the Valar Yavanna to refer to that part of her natural realm capable of moving or escaping, as opposed to the olvar which were rooted in place. The terms kelvar and olvar, then, refer respectively to animal and plant life, and are essentially equivalent in meaning to fauna and flora.
After the awakening of the Elves, some of the kelvar were said to have been inhabited by powerful spirits. Most famous among these were the great Eagles that overlooked events in Middle-earth from their mountainous eyries.
==Etymology==
Kelvar is an Elvish word meaning "animals, living things that move", probably derived from the stem KEL, meaning "go" or "run"., p. 363 It has been suggested that kelvar is a Quenya word, and that the (unattested) singular form would likely be kelva.Helge Fauskanger, "http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist" (accessed 15 March 2011)
Other words for "animal" (names which in general only referred to "four-footed beasts, and never to reptiles or birds") were Quenya laman (pl. lamni or lamani), and Sindarin lavan (pl. levain)., p. 416 (note 33)
In Gnomish, one of J.R.R. Tolkiens early conceptions of an Elvish language, the word for "living creature, animal" is cuid. The word meg is glossed as "any small animal, especially mole"., pp. 27, 56
