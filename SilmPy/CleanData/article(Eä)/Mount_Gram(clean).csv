Mount Gram was a mountain inhabited by Orcs.
==History==
Mount Gram was inhabited by Orcs led by their King Golfimbul. In  they attacked much of northern Eriador, but were defeated in the Battle of Greenfields.
==Location==
The location of Mount Gram has never been established and the mountain could have been anywhere within the northern Eriador region.
The Appendix B mentions that in  "Orcs renew their invasions of Eriador", obviously referring to Orcs of the Misty Mountains, mentioned in the immediate previous entries. "The Orcs#Orcs and Goblins of Mount Gram" who invaded the Shire in  obviously were a subsequent wave of them.
This must be the reason why Robert Foster considers Gram to have been one of the Misty Mountains, although he does not cite a specific source or reason to do so.
On the other hand, Karen Wynn Fonstad (also without explanation) placed it on a promontory in the Ettenmoors.
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the earliest writings of The Hobbit, Mount Gram was merely "Gram Hill"., p. 8

Gram in Old English means "fierce, grim" but it is not certain that the name was intended as Old English.
