Brandagamba is the original Westron version of the Hobbits translated into English as Brandybuck.
==Etymology==
It contains the element branda- borderland (referring to Buckland being on the eastern edge of the Shire), but also evokes Branda-nîn, border-water (the early hobbitish name for the Brandywine river).
The second half of the compound, -gamba, is a re-occurrence from the older name Zaragamba, or Oldbuck in the sense of a male deer or ram.
The river Branda-nîn was later jokingly altered to Bralda-hîm, heady ale. According to Tolkien, "only a very bold hobbit would have ventured to call the Master of Buckland braldagamba in his hearing". 
===Note on translation===
While "Marchbuck Family" would be a literal translation of the name, it would lose the traditional connection with Brandywine, apparent in the actual Brandagamba-Branda-nîn. J.R.R. Tolkien rather translated the name as "Brandybuck" in order to retain this connection.
