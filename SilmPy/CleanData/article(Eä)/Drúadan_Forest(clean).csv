Drúadan Forest was in the fief of Anórien, in Gondor, lying north of the eastern end of the White Mountains.  Located near or in the Forest were three of Warning beacons of Gondor: To the west was Nardol, within the woods was Eilenach, and just east of the woods was Amon Dîn.  Skirting the northern edge of Drúadan Forest was the great road that connected Gondor to Rohan, while within the southern part of the forest was the long-abandoned road through Stonewain Valley.
It was avoided by the people of Gondor and Rohan, who believed it was haunted: in reality the forest was home to a small enclave of Drúedain, or Woses, who only survived in these woods and in the Drúwaith Iaur., p. 383
During the War of the Ring, a host of Orcs was found by scouts of the Rohirrim three miles west of Amon Dîn upon the Great West Road and moving toward Théodens forces.  A leader of the Woses, Ghân-buri-Ghân came forward and offered to lead the Rohirrim by secret paths through the forest so they could avoid the Orcs.  Taking the forgotten road down Stonewain Valley the riders of Rohan were able to come to Pelennor Fields undetected.
In exchange for this help the forest was later given to the Drúedain as a protected enclave inside the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor by Aragorn.
The name of the forest apparently means "Forest of the Drúedain".
