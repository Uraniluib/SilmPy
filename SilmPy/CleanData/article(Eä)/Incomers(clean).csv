Incomers refers to the Easterlings (First Age) usurpers who ruled the land of Dor-lómin granted them by Morgoth after their treachery in the of Nirnaeth Arnoediad. It was a term used by the remnant of the House of Hador left as serfs and thralls under the tyranny of Brodda of the House of Ulfang., p. 253
Lady Aerin used this term in her meeting with Túrin Mormegil after his sack of the Hall of Brodda.

The name Incomers was also used in a rejected version of the legend of Amroth and Nimrodel, apparently referring to Elves from lost Beleriand which entered Lothlórien., p. 13
