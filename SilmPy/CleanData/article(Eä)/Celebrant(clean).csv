Celebrant (translated as Silverlode) was a stream rising in the eastern Misty Mountains from the Mirrormere in the Dimrill Dale. It then ran through Lothl처rien where it was met by the Nimrodel (river) river, and emptied into the Anduin. 
==History==

Around November  Elladan and Elrohir, sent by Elrond to a secret errand, passed down the Silverlode into a "strange country" and were the last to return to Rivendell, in December.
The Fellowship of the Ring followed this river when they travelled from Moria to Lothl처rien.
