The "Three Hunters" was the name that Aragorn bestowed upon the remnant of the Fellowship of the Ring—including himself, Legolas, and Gimli—on 26 February  as they began tracking the Uruk-hai that had captured Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took at Amon Hen. 
 
The Three Hunters descended Emyn Muil and entered Rohan; with Aragorns tracking skills, they successfully followed the right track and even found Pippins Elven brooches, which had been dropped for them to find. The hunt continued for three days.
 
On 30 February they encountered Éomer and his éored who had slaughtered the Orc-band the day before and were on the way back to Edoras. Éomer demanded their names and business and fighting almost broke out between Gimli and Éomer.  Aragorn prevented the fight and Éomer listened to their story of their journey and the losses of Gandalf, Boromir, and the two young hobbits.  Although Éomer believed that the hobbits must have been slain in the attack, he lent them two horses—Hasufel and Arod—and asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Edoras.
 
With their horses, the Three Hunters followed Éomers instructions and reached the outskirts of Fangorn Forest.  As night fell they encountered an old man who vanished, as did their horses.  On 1 March Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli met Gandalf the White and their hunt was over, although it was not until 5 March that they again saw Merry and Pippin at Isengard.  Later the two hobbits would follow other paths during the War of the Ring but Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stayed together to the end.
