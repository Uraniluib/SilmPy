File:John Howe - Wolf Riders.jpg - Wolf Riders
Wolf-riders were mostly Orcs, who rode wolves.
Orcs used wolves as steeds back in the First Age, as well as wargs well into the Third Age, when wolf-riders came in the Battle of Five Armies.
During the War of the Ring, Saruman employed "Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men"Ã‰omers reference seems to suggest that Wolf-riders are not necessarily Orcs, nor Men, making their identity uncertain. Cf. . to harass Rohan.  Before the Battle of the Hornburg, scouts reported that Wolf-riders were roaming the valley about Helms Deep.
