Arvernien was the coastland of Beleriand west of the Mouths of Sirion. It had the protection of Ulmo.
==History==
Arvernien was originally an uninhabited land, known mainly for the forest of Nimbrethil,, "Index" but after the rout that became known as the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and the subsequent destruction of the Havens of Brithombar and Eglarest, Círdan and Falathrim dwelt in this region. Though at first they lived on the Isle of Balar, they later founded the Havens of Sirion. The area became a known refuge, as when Gondolin Fall of Gondolin, many of its people fled southward too and those were followed by Iathrim from Doriath.
The Havens were devastated by the Third Kinslaying when the remaining Sons of Feanor came to claim the Nauglamir held by Earendil. Following Eärendils return from his journeys out at sea and the War of Wrath in which Morgoth was defeated, Beleriand, and Arvernien with it, was destroyed.
==Etymology==
Tolkien only ever gave an incomplete translation of the name Arvernien: "(the land) beside the Verna"., pp. 19, 71 (July 2007) 
Except the core element Verna, the name can be analyzed as prefix ar meaning "beside, without" (see also argad) and the geographical ending -ien which translates as "land of". The meaning of Verna is, however, unclear. 
Considering that the name was an invention of Tolkiens early legendarium, when Beleriand was still called Broseliand, David Salo suggested the name might actually have been inspired by the French region of wikipedia:Auvergne.David Salo, http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/34598 Message 34598, Elfling
