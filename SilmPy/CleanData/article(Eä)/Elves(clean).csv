The Elves (Quendi) were the first of the races of the Children of Ilúvatar, known also as the Firstborn for that reason.  The Elves are distinguished from the other two races, the Men and the Dwarves, especially by the fact of their near immortality.
==History==
===Awakening===

File:Ted Nasmith - The Dawn of the Firstborn Elves.jpg - The Dawn of the Firstborn Elves About the same time that Varda, Queen of the Valier, ended her labours in creating the Stars, the Elves awoke beside the lake Cuiviénen.  The first things they saw were the stars, and henceforth they adored them.  The first sound they heard was the flowing of water, and henceforth they loved water as well.
They made speech then, and called themselves the Quendi.  Morgoth was the first to be aware of them, and he caused evil spirits to go about among them.  When one or a small group wandered abroad, they would often vanish.  It is believed that Melkor may have created Orcs with the elves he captured.
Oromë, the Huntsman of the Valar, happened upon them when he heard their singing far-off.  He was amazed to see them, and called them the Eldar, "People of the Stars".
===Sundering===

File:Anke Eißmann - Oromë espies the first Elves.jpg - Oromë espies the first Elves Though at first the Quendi were afraid of Oromë, the noblest among them saw that he was no dark horseman, as the lies of Melkor claimed.  He had the light of Aman in his eyes and face, and they were drawn to him.
After spending a while among the Quendi, Oromë returned to Valinor and took council with the other Valar and Valier.  At the counsel of Ilúvatar, Manwë, King of the Valar, decided that they must go to war against Melkor to protect the Quendi from him.  After a great battle and Siege of Utumno, which reshaped the earth itself, Melkor was bound and cast into the prison of Mandos.  Then the Valar, pleased with the outcome, summoned the Elves to Valinor, seeking fellowship with them.
At Oromës urging, many of the Elves (especially the kindreds of Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë) agreed.  But others, henceforth called the Avari, declared that they preferred starlight and the wide spaces of Middle-earth.  So the Elves were first sundered.  During the journey to Belegaer, gradually the number of the Elves began to lessen as various groups dropped away.  Some of the Teleri (kindred of Elwë) refused to cross the Misty Mountains, and settled in Anduin under the leadership of Lenwë, to be called later the Nandor.  Elwë then went missing, and in dismay the rest of the Teleri remained behind, while the Noldor (kindred of Finwë) and Vanyar (kindred of Ingwë) used an island as a ship, and found at last Aman and Valinor.
After several years, Oromë returned to search for the Teleri.  Some, under Olwë, relented and followed.  Others remained to continue to search for Elwë.  Still others, under Círdan, remained because in that time they had become devoted to Ossë and the Sea.  Those Teleri that chose to remain were called the Sindar.  Elwë, who had fallen asleep due to his enchantment with Melian, returned to claim lordship and establish them in Doriath.  The Noldor and some of the Teleri, however, built the great cities of Tirion and Alqualondë (respectively) in Aman.  The Vanyar dwelt in Valmar, for they were closest to the Valar of the kindreds.
===Exile of the Noldor===

File:Jenny Dolfen - The Coming of Fingolfin.jpg - The Coming of Fingolfin Melkor, having been released on the promise of good behavior, spread lies about the Valar among the Noldor.  Fëanor, the eldest son of Finwë and one of the greatest Elves to have ever lived, hated Melkor more than all the other Noldor, but was paradoxically one of the most influenced by his lies.  He forged weapons, and his greatest works, the Silmarils, captured the light of the Two Trees – and his own heart.  After Melkor stole the Silmarils and killed Finwë, Fëanor stirred the Noldor to open disobedience to the Valar.  In an epic journey filled with treachery, death, and deceit, the Noldor entered in to Exile, crossing over into Beleriand.
===Battles of Beleriand===

There were five great battles fought in Beleriand.  The First Battle was the result of an attack by Melkor on Círdan and Elwë (now known as Thingol).  Though the Elves managed to resist the attack successfully, this left Melkor essentially with full reign of Beleriand.  Upon the sudden and unanticipated Return of the Noldor, the tables were reversed in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.  The third battle (“Dagor Aglareb”) occurred when Melkor tried unsuccessfully to destroy the Elves, breaking forth from Angband.  This only resulted in the vigilant Siege of Angband.  Morgoth was more successful in the next battle, Dagor Bragollach, which ended in the deaths of many Elven princes, among them Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor.  The siege was broken.  Several decades later, Maedhros, eldest son of Fëanor, counterattacked in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.  Although at first very successful, the tide turned against the Elves, and ended in the destruction of Hithlum.  It was not half a century later that Gondolin, the last real stronghold of the Noldor, was Fall of Gondolin.  Doriath, the centre of the Sindarin realm, was sacked by Dwarves.File:Ted Nasmith - Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons.jpg - Eärendil and The Battle of Eagles and Dragons
===Salvation===

With the near destruction of the Elves, the last survivors were at the Mouths of Sirion and Isle of Balar and were led by Gil-galad and Círdan. Among them was Eärendil, the son of Tuor and Idril.  Eärendil made a miraculous voyage to Valinor to beg the pardon of the Valar.  His request was granted.  The Valar came across the Sea to Middle-earth, and in the War of Wrath thrust Morgoth into the Void and purged Beleriand.  They offered to let the Elves return with them to Valinor; some accepted, but many others, under Gil-galad, chose to remain.
===Decline===
File:Angus McBride - Celebrimbor.gif - Celebrimbor Though Morgoth was gone to trouble the world no longer, Sauron, his greatest servant, was still there, and he made war on the remaining Elves who chose not to depart Middle-earth throughout the Second Age and Third Ages.  
During this time the Elves realized how Men were rising to take their place, and Sauron exploited their longing. Annatar corrupted Celebrimbor, the grandson of Fëanor, to make the Rings of Power, especially the Three Rings to preserve the Elves. Annatar was a guise of Sauron who also forged a ring – the One Ring. However the Elves realised the deception and defied Sauron, who then War of the Elves and Sauron. In the following centuries Elves continued to heed the invitation of the Valar, desire the Sea and depart for the Undying Lands. Realms such as Dol Amroth were deserted and gave their place to Men.
It was not until the end of the Third Age that the One Ring was destroyed, marring the Three Rings at the same time.  In the years that followed the last of the Elves departed across the Sea to Valinor, their mission against Sauron complete, never to return.
Well into the Fourth Age and the Dominion of Men, most Elves apparently had left the Westlands, with most populations remaining at least in Mirkwood and Lindon. Rivendell and Lothlórien appeared mostly abandoned around the time of King Elessars and Arwens death.
The Elves eventually faded, as their spirits overwhelmed and consumed their bodies. At the end of the world, all Elves will have become invisible to mortal eyes, known as Lingerers, except to those to whom they wish to manifest themselves. Ilúvatar had not revealed the role of the Elves after the End.
==Life and customs==
:Main articles: Elven characteristics, Elven life cycle, and Elven customs
Besides being considered more beautiful than men, Elves were also generally taller.  Their hair colour varied; but the basic rules were that the Noldor generally had dark hair (brown or black), the Vanyar golden, and the Teleri silver or dark.  Their eyes are usually described as grey. 
Their lives were counted to begin at conception rather than birth, and though their minds sharpened much earlier in life than in the race of Men, their bodies grew more slowly.  They were considered fully-grown at about a century.  They married usually only once in their lives, and their children were often few and far-between.
Their most distinguishing characteristic from the Mortals races was the fact that they were invulnerable to age or disease; unless they were killed by sword or sorrow, they would live to the end of the world. Unlike Men whose fëar (spirits) left Arda when their bodies died, Elves fëar were bound to Arda until its ending. If an Elfs hröa (body) died, its fëa would be summoned to the Halls of Mandos, where the Valar could re-embody the Elf in a hröa that was identical to the Elfs previous hröa. However, if an Elf committed evil acts during their lifetime and refused to repent, the Valar could delay the Elfs re-embodiment, impose conditions on it, or refuse it altogether., p. 339, pp. 380, 389 An Elf could refuse the summons to Mandos or choose to remain disembodied,, p. 334 but the Elfs houseless fëa would still be unable to leave Arda.
==Arts, crafts, powers and magic==
Other races often spoke of Elf magic, or of objects made by Elves as if they contained enchantments. It is unclear how accurate it is to call Elvish arts and crafts magic or enchanted. Elves themselves only used these words when attempting to simplify or clarify how elvish-made things seemed to have a special quality that no other races were able to achieve. Powerful Elves seemed to have control over nature and the elements, their clothes seemed to shine with their own light, their blades seemed to never lose their sharpness. Less educated folks could not explain these effects, so they simply called them magic.
==Major divisions==







The term quendi refers to all Elves; it was was created at Cuiviénen before the Elves had contact with any other race. When Oromë invited the Elves to Valinor, those who followed him on the Great Journey were called the Eldar, while those who refused were called the Avari. The Eldar were divided into three clans−the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri. All of the Vanyar and Noldor reached Aman. Two groups of Teleri abandoned the Great Journey: the Nandor, who came to live in the Vale of Anduin, and the Sindar, who remained in Beleriand. The Nandor eventually split into the Laiquendi, who migrated into Beleriand and settled in Ossiriand, and the Silvan Elves, who established realms in Mirkwood and Lothlórien. Those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and settled in Aman were called the Falmari. Those Noldor who later returned to Middle-earth in exile were called the Etyañgoldi.
==Languages==

File:Donato Giancola - Lore.jpeg - Lore Because J.R.R. Tolkien developed the Elves almost for his languages, those he developed are of special interest to many Tolkien scholars.  His primary languages are Quenya and Sindarin, but these have many variants and dialects as is seen in the table below.  They were generally written in the Cirth and Tengwar scripts.

**Avarin
***Various Avarin languages (some later merged with Nandorin)
**Common Eldarin (the early language of all the Eldar)
***Quenya (the language of the Noldor and the Vanyar)

==Inspiration==
===Germanic influence===
In The Book of Lost Tales, a diminutive fairy-like race of elves had once been a great and mighty people who had "diminished" as Men took over the world.Dimitra Fimi, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_117/ai_n16676591 "Mad" Elves and "elusive beauty": some Celtic strands of Tolkiens mythology in Folklore, vol. 117, iss. 2, August 2006, pp. 156–170 They were influenced by the Wikipedia:Elf of Northern European mythologies, especially the god-like and human-sized Wikipedia:Light elf of Norse mythology,Tom Shippey, The Road to Middle-earth also appearing in medieval works such as Sir Orfeo, the Welsh Pwyll Prince of Dyved, The Fall of Arthur and the legends of the Wikipedia:Tuatha Dé Danann.J.R.R. Tolkien and Douglas A. Anderson (ed.), The Annotated Hobbit, p. 120 
Terry Gunnell also claims that the relationship between beautiful ships and the Elves is reminiscent of Njörðr and Skíðblaðni, Freyrs ship.
===Celtic influence===
Tolkien expressed a dislike in Celtic legends and denied that his legendarium is "Celtic",, p. 26 however it is believed that Celtic Mythology had a great influence on Tolkiens writings on Elves John Garth, Tolkien and the Great War, p. 222Terry Gunnell, "http://www.hi.is/Apps/WebObjects/HI.woa/wa/dp?detail=1004509&name=nordals_en_greinar_og_erindi Tívar in a Timeless Land: Tolkiens Elves" conference lecture delivered on 13 September 2002 and some of the stories Tolkien wrote as their legends are directly influenced by it.  For example, the Noldor are based on the Tuatha Dé Danann in the Lebor Gabála Érenn, and their migratory nature comes from early Irish/Celtic history. John Garth has also referenced the Tuatha Dé Danann in suggesting Tolkien was essentially rewriting Irish fairy traditions.
Tolkien also retains the usage of the Celtic and popular term fairy for the same creatures.Marjorie J. Burns, Perilous Realms: Celtic and Norse in Tolkiens Middle-earth, p. 22 The Elves are also called fair folk (based on Welsh Tylwyth teg the beautiful kindred = fairies), p. 757 cf. "Fair folk" although they are unrelated to fairies.
===Eschatology===
The larger Elves are also inspired by Tolkiens Christian theology — as representing the state of Men in Eden who have not yet "Wikipedia:Fall of Man" — similar to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature, freed from human limitations, immortal, with wills directly effective for the achievement of imagination and desire.
===Fairies===
Traditional "Victorian" dancing fairies and elves appear in Tolkiens early poetry, and have influence upon his later worksDimitra Fimi, "http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/working_with_english/Fimi_31_05_06.pdf Come sing ye light fairy things tripping so gay: Victorian Fairies and the Early Work of J. R. R. Tolkien". Working With English: Medieval and Modern Language, Literature and Drama. Retrieved 11/01/08 in part due to the influence of a production of J.M. Barries Peter Pan in Birmingham in 1910Humphrey Carpenter, J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography and his familiarity with the work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson whose work Tolkien had acquired in 1914.
In The Book of Lost Tales Tolkien includes both the more serious medieval type of elves such as Fëanor and Turgon alongside the frivolous, "Jacobean-era" type of elves such as the Solosimpi and Lúthien. 
Tolkien also developed the idea of children visiting Valinor in their sleep. Elves would also visit and comfort chided or upset children at night. This theme was largely abandoned.
However after the publication of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien repeatedly expressed his misgivings concerning the undesirable associations of the name "elf" like those of A Midsummer Nights Dream, the Victorian notions of fairies or mischievous imps, the imaginations of Michael Drayton or the fanciful beings with butterfly wings. 
He proposed that in translations of The Lord of the Rings the "oldest available form of the name" be used for more elevated notions of beings  "supposed to possess formidable magical powers in early Teutonic mythology" (OED viz. the Old English ælf, from Proto-Germanic *albo-z). Tolkien warned against associations to the debased English notion of elfin and suggested that Germans would not translate his Elves as Elf, elfen, words which might retain the undesirable images.
He rather suggested words such as Alp, Alb, historically the more normal form and true cognate of English elf., p. 756, s.v. "Elven-smiths".
