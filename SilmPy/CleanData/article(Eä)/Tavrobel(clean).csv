__NOTOC__
Tavrobel or Tathrobel was a village on Tol Eressea, the home of Pengolodh when he returned to the West, and where Aelfwine saw and translated the Annals.
==Etymology==
In the Etymologies, the name is envisioned as Noldorin and is reinterpreted to contain the Noldorin words tavr "woodpecker" and gobel "encircled village"., entries TAM and PEL(ES)
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tavrobel appears in the earliest phases of the Legendarium as a town on the western part of Tol Eressëa., p. 62 The Tower of Tavrobel was beside the rivers Afros and Gruir which joined at the bridge of Tavrobel. Nearby the bridge was the Gilfanons home, the House of the Hundred Chimneys. Around the land, the Gnomes lived as one people., p. 175 It was located a league away from the Heath of the Sky-roof.
In Tolkiens notes, Gilfanon hosted Ottor Wǽfre (Eriol) in his House, where he compiled the Golden Book with the tales he had heard, and then was allowed to drink limpe. Eriol died in Tavrobel. One of his sons, Heorrenda afterwards settled Tavrobel, and it became Wikipedia:Great Haywood.
Tavrobel was also considered to be the name of a settlement in Brethil of the Haladin and Túrin. See: Amon Obel.
In the early Gnomish Lexicon, the name is said to mean "wood-home", including the Gnomish words taur, tavros "forest" from root TAVA; and pel said to mean "village, hamlet, -ham".
==Inspiration==
Tavrobel is identified as Great Haywood, or more specifically Staffordshire village. Tolkien was stationed in a camp near Great Haywood and Edith Tolkien lived there after their marriage. Tolkien was again in Great Haywood in the winter of 1916-1917, after his return from France.
G. L. Elkin, the Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, has further suggested to Christopher Tolkien that Gilfanons House of Hundred Chimneys may have been based on the Wikipedia:Shugborough Hall at the Great Haywood, and likewise the bridge of Tavrobel may have been based on the Wikipedia:Essex Bridge, Staffordshire that crosses River Trent 100 metres of its confluence with River Sow. The nearby Heath of the Sky-roof, the site of a battle among Men, was perhaps inspired by Hopton Heath, the site of the Wikipedia:Battle of Hopton Heath.
Christopher Tolkien notes that as Great Haywood is near the confluence of Wikipedia:River Sow and Wikipedia:River Trent, the two Tavrobels are also near the confluence of two rivers: Afros / Gruir (Tol Eressea) and Taeglin / Sirion (Brethil).
