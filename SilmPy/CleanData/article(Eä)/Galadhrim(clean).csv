The Galadhrim or the Tree-people were the Elves, mostly Silvan Elves in origin, who inhabited the woods of Lothlórien. 
==History==
Some of the Nandor, the Teleri who abandoned the Great Journey of the Eldar on the  eastern side of the Misty Mountains, settled down in the Vales of Anduin and later on established the realms of Mirkwood in the north and Lothlórien in the south of Mirkwood. 
In the beginning the Silvan Elves of Lórien were a small and scattered people, and as the power of the Longbeards of Moria grew, they relocated to the eastern side of the Anduin.
===Second Age===
After the War of Wrath at the beginning of the Second Age many of the Sindar of Beleriand migrated eastward. The Elves of Lórien welcomed them. The coming of the Sindar was a great boost to the power and culture of the Silvan Elves. The Silvan language was replaced by Sindarin. 
The arrival of one in particular affected them: the Sinda Amdír took over Lórien. Under his leadership the people of Lórien prospered and their numbers grew. Amdir led an army of Galadhrim to the War of the Last Alliance, where most of them, including Amdír himself, were slain in the Battle of Dagorlad. 
===Third Age===
The Galadhrim were now ruled by Amroth the son of Amdír. Around , some Galadhrim passed over the Misty Mountains to join forces with Rivendell under Elrond against Angmar. Along with assistance with the Elves of Lindon, they were successful in subduing the witch-kingdom for some time.
Around  with the freeing of Durins Bane in Moria many of the Galadhrim fled south to Dol Amroth and sailed over Sea to Valinor. Amroth grew weary of Middle-earth and wished to sail. But he drowned in the Bay of Belfalas.
In her wisdom Galadriel saw that Lórien would be a stronghold and a point of power to prevent the shadow from crossing the Anduin, for the Galadhrim were hardy and valiant. But they needed a ruler of greater strength and wisdom than they possessed. That is why Galadriel and Celeborn took up their permanent abode in Lórien and its government. Under the leadership of Galadriel and Celeborn the Galadhrim prospered and their skill grew.  
The Galadhrim defended their home against orcs, who attacked around the end of the Third Age, just before Sauron was destroyed. The Galadhrim weathered all of the attacks. 
With the departure over Sea of Galadriel, most of the Galadhrim went with Celeborn to East Lórien.
==Culture==
The Galadhrim prospered and were instructed under their Sindarin rulers, and afterwards by Lord and Lady of Galadhrim. They became proficient in making Lembas, Elven rope, Elven-cloaks and many other crafts. They lived in telain built in the trees.
They spoke Silvan Elvish, and a dialect of Sindarin. Some, like Haldir, but not all, could speak Westron.
==Etymology==
Galadhrim is a Sindarin name meaning "Tree-people". The name consists of galadh ("tree") + rim ("great number")., p. 50 See also LotR (50th) p. 341.
In the first edition of The Lord of the Rings, Galadhrim was spelt Galadrim. In later editions, this was emended to the former, which J.R.R. Tolkien had decided was the correct Sindarin form., p. 305
