The Battles of the Fords of the Isen were the first battles in the War of the Ring. In order to invade Rohan, Saruman had to cross the river Isen first (as well as take care of other things). The first battle, known as the First Battle of the Fords of Isen was on 25 February . Its main objective seems to have been to kill Th√©odred (in which Saruman succeeded). In the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen on 2 March, Saruman finally won passage over the river, beating a heavily outnumbered army of Rohirrim under Grimbold and Elfhelm.
