Nardol was the third Warning beacons of Gondor of Gondor. It stood on the broad end of a ridge of the White Mountains, west of the Drúadan Forest, and the guard station maintained there could create a huge signal fire when needed. It was well-stored with fuel and at need a great blaze could be lit. Its fire could be visible on a clear night even as far as the Amon Anwar (some 120 miles to the west). The guard of Nardol also protected the quarries., p. 510
A line of hills ran from Nardol to Amon Dîn.
On the night of 7 March  Gandalf and Peregrin Took, riding east on Shadowfax, saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.
==Etymology==
Nardol is Sindarin, meaning "fire-hilltop" (naur "fire" + dol "hill"), because its beacon-fire was so bright., p. 19
