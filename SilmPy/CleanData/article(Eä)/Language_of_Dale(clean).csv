__NOTOC__
The Language of Dale was the tongue spoken by the Men of Dale Dale and as a Northern Mannish, it was related to Rohirric and more distantly, to Westron. 
The language, as well as the personal names of the Men of Dale closely resembled those of the Men in the Vale of Anduin and those of the Rohirrim; even those of some Hobbits who used high-sounding names and words from the Mannish language of the upper Anduin.The relationship of the languages can be seen in the D. name Brand along with the H. name Ferdibrand Took and the R. name Erkenbrand.
The language of Dale was adopted by the Dwarves from that region, such as the Dwarves of Erebor. In fact they used this tongue to introduce themselves to outsiders, forming their "outer" names, as it was a taboo to use their true, original Khuzdul names to other races.
The writing system used by the Men of Dale was an old and simple form of the Cirth.
==Translation==
In J.R.R. Tolkiens stories, the language of Dale was rendered with North Germanic languages, a language related to Old English and modern English as the tongue of Dale was related to Rohirric and Westron.
