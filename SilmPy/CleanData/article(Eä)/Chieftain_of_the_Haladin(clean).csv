The Chieftain of the Haladin, later Chieftain of the House of Haleth was an elected title given to the leader of the Haladin during the early First Age, the second group of the Edain to cross the Blue Mountains and enter Beleriand and become allies of the Elves. Shortly after arriving the Haladin were attacked by Orcs and Haleth, daughter of the recently slain Chieftain, was responsible for the survival of her people. Thereafter, the Chieftain of the Haladin became a hereditary title.
Not only did Haleth save her people, she led them to a safer Forest of Brethil and bargained for their home. In exchange for defending a river crossing their would remain freemen, never swearing eternal allegiance to any lord. In honor of her memory, the Haladin would rename themselves the House of Haleth, and Chieftain of the Haladin would become the Chieftain of the House of Haleth and Warden (Halad) of Brethil.
