Azanulbizar was the Khuzdul name for "Dimrill Dale". The name was lent to the Battle of Azanulbizar fought there.
==Etymology==
J.R.R. Tolkien explored various possibilities regarding the exact interpretation of the elements occurring in the name: it is either Azanul + bizar or Uzn+Ã»l+bizar, though the whole was to somehow express "Dimrill Dale".
Tolkien stated that "the Common Speech form is an accurate translation: the valley of the dim (overshadowed) rills that ran down the mountainside".Jared Lobdell (ed.), A Tolkien Compass, p. 182 In another point it is given as "Vale of Dim Streams" with three elements., p. 466
The first interpretation says that azan "shadows, dimnesses", -ul genitive marker and bizar "streams, rills"; in this interpretation it means "rills of shadows", and the word "dale" is understood (the full name being duban Azanulbizar)., p. 269 
According to the second interpretation, bizar means "dale" and ul "rill(s), streams".
