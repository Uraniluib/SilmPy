Adalgar Oldbank was a Bree-hobbits of Bree in the Lord of the Rings: War in the North.
He owns a shop near the Prancing Pony and sells potions and arrows. Unlike many other Bree-landers, he is friendly to Rangers of the North because they are the only sources of news in Bree. He is, however, unaware of the protection of the Rangers against the dangers of Eriador.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Prologue
