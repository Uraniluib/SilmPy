__NOTOC__
The Black Speech was created by Sauron during the Dark Years to be the sole language of all the servants of Mordor, replacing the many different varieties of Orkish and other languages used by his servants. When Sauron was overthrown at the end of the Second Age the ancient "pure" form was forgotten by all but the Nazgûl.  When Sauron returned it was once again made the official language of Barad-dûr.  However, a more "debased" form was used by the soldiery of Barad-dûr at the end of the Third Age. The only example given of "pure" Black Speech is the inscription upon the One Ring:

Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.

When translated into English, these words form the lines:

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

These are the first two lines from the end of a Ring Verse about the Rings of Power.
Many Orkish dialects had adopted words from it. The Black Speech was at least in part based on Valarin.
==Inspiration==
In real life, J. R. R. Tolkien created this language with the intention of making it harsh and ugly. The Black Speech is one of the more incomplete languages in Tolkiens novels, because the forces of good refuse to utter it. 
Tolkien linguist Helge Fauskanger has noted a theory proposed by Russian historian Alexander Nemirovski, that the Black Speech, according to the shape of words, agglutination and grammar, shares many similarities with the ancient Mesopotamian language Wikipedia:Hurrian language.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
