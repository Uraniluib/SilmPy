The Roll was a list of names created by Hobbits following the Battle of Bywater. The Roll contained all those hobbits who fought in the Battle of Bywater, with Captains Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took appearing at the top of the list. Other Hobbits who fought were Samwise Gamgee, Farmer Cotton, Tolman Cotton Junior, Wilcome Cotton II and Bowman Cotton.
In latter years the Roll was learned by heart by Shire-historians, and the rise of fame and fortune of the Cotton Family dates from this time.
