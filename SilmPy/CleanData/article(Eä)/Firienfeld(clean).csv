Firienfeld was how the Rohirrim called the flat upland of Dunharrow; a large grassy area for the encampment of soldiers and refuge-seekers.  Aragorn and the Grey Company passed through the Firienfeld on 8 March ; King Th√©oden and his riders arrived there the next day.
==Etymology==
Firien represents Old English firgen, "mountain"; -feld, means "field" and J.R.R. Tolkien left it unmodernised; the Firienfield of the Index is in error., p. 770
