The Mindeb was a river of Beleriand, a northern tributary to the river Sirion.
The Mindeb began in the Ered Gorgoroth near the Anach, and was met by a tributary coming from the Crissaegrim. Upon its western bank was the land of Dimbar while on the east were the valley of Nan Dungortheb and the Forest of Neldoreth.  In its lower reaches it bordered Doriath and thus was part of the Girdle of Melian.
