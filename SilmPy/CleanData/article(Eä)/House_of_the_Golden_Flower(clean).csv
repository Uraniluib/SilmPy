The House of the Golden Flower was an Eldarin noble House, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondothlim of Gondolin.  Glorfindel of Gondolin was its lord,. and its device was that of a rayed sun.
==History==
When the forces of Angband Fall of Gondolin, the strength of the Golden Flower was in the Great Market, on the east part of the city, where they were ambushed by a host of Orcs led by Balrogs. For hours they fought, until a Fire-drakes came and killed many of them. There were only a few survivors, among them Glorfindel. 
The House of the Harp was sent to their aid, but its lord Salgant wished to betray them. However, the men of his house rebelled against him and they rushed to the aid of the Golden Flower, many of them being killed in that market. 
Eventually Balrogs and Dragons who reinforced Morgoths army breached the walls of Gondolin, and the House of the Golden Flower, along with the remaining houses, moved towards the Square of the King. Further on, many lost their lives holding the rear for those who retreated towards Idrils secret way. The few remaining members assisted helpless to their Lords death during his fight with the Balrog.
