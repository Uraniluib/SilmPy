Axes were tools for chopping wood and excellent mêlée weaponry, usually associated with Dwarves, but not exclusively used by them.
==History==
When the threat of Morgoth started to loom over Valinor, there was unrest among the people of Fëanor. So they came to smithing weaponry. The Noldor, renowned steelwrights, crafted sword, spears and axes. Dwarves also made axes; their (doomed) alliance with Thingol made them trade many fine axes, swords and spears with the King of the Sindar. Axes would remain to be the main weapon of the march wardens of Doriath, and were also used by their allies, the House of Haleth in Brethil. 
==Axes by Faction==
* The Dwarves had the axe as their chief weapon. Dwarven warriors would carry at least one standard axe, though sometimes carried backup weapons as well. The Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, bore axes. Axes were also used during the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Durin had a Durins Axe, Gimli bore one, and Dáin Ironfoot had a red axe.
* The Forces of Darkness were known to use axes in combat. Orcs and Balrogs used it as a weapon in battles. Gothmog (balrog), the Lord of Balrogs himself bore a black axe. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields Easterlings wielded great axes, and were among the most effective forces of Minas Morgul.
* The Númenóreans were passed the craft of weaponsmithing by the Noldor, and they managed to forge great axes. Their main purpose seems to have been not in war, but in deforesting the woods of Middle-earth for ship-timber.
*Among the Atani of the First Age, the most notable axe-bearers are probably Huor and Tuor, whose axe was called Dramborleg. The Men of Brethil carried little weaponry, but mostly axes.
