==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
There were two versions of the genealogical table for the House of Hador.  In the first version of the table there was a note that Beren, son of Belemir and Adanel, was their fifth child. In the second version there was no reference to these other children.  The section of the second version shown above shows only the first Beren although the other children may have existed., Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador, p. 233
