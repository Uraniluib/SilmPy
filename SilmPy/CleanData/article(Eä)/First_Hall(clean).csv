The First Hall of Moria was on the eastern side of the Misty Mountains, above the Dimrill Dale and apparently the first hall built by Durin I.  The Great Gates of Moria led right into the First Hall, and from this space there was a wide passage and stairs leading to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the Second Hall, and the rest of the city.  In contrast to much of Khazad-dûm, the First Hall was brightly lit due to high windows on the eastern side.  After the fall of Gandalf, the remaining members of the Fellowship of the Ring ran through the First Hall to escape from Moria on January 15 .
