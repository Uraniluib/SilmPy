Grimslade was the ancestral home of Grimbold, a lesser First Marshal of the Riddermark. Nothing is known of the location of this structure other that it stood in the Westfold of Rohan. The word "slade" seems to imply that the house was either in a clearing or on a hillside. 
==Etymology==
The name Grimslade is modernized from Old English Grimslaed representing Rohan language.Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, The Lord of the Rings: A Readers Companion, p. 571
It comes from Grim, which Tolkien describes as "evidently the name of an ancestor", and slade, "forest glade, dell on the slope of a hillside" widely used in English place-names., p. 771
