The river Adurant was the southernmost of the seven rivers of Ossiriand marking its southern boundary.  It ran from the southern Ered Luin into the river Gelion, marking the southern boundary of Ossiriand. Halfway along its course the river divided and later rejoined, forming the island of Tol Galen.
==Etymology==
The name means Doublestream (from adu "double" and rant "course") in Sindarin, referring to a parting of the river about the isle of Tol Galen.
