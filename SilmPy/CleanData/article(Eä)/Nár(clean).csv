Nár was an old Dwarves, the sole companion of King Thrór when he set out to wander in the wilds of Middle-earth.
==History==
Virtually nothing is known of Nár. However what is known is that he set out with the King of Durin’s folk from Dunland, where the Thrórs following of relatives and subjects were living at the time to find his fortunes in wider world.
Their journey eventually brought them to the old Dwarves-halls of Moria, now infested with Orcs and Trolls. Disregarding the pleas of Nár, Thrór insisted on entering Moria while Nár stayed behind and waited for the king not far from the gate. 
That was the last any Dwarf ever saw of Thrór alive. He was beheaded by the Orcs, and their chieftain Azog branded his own name on Thrórs brow. The Orcs allowed Nár to live so he could return to Thrórs son Thráin, with a message that Azog now ruled in Moria, and that Dwarves best stay away lest they suffer the same fate. 
Nár returned to Dunland where his message caused such anger amongst his people that it raised a call to arms among all seven Dwarf Houses to avenge the elder high-king of their race, leading the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. 
In the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar, Azog himself was slain along with thousands of others on both sides.
