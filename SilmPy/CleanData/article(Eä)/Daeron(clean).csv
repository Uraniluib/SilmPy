__NOTOC__
Daeron was a Sindar Elves who dwelt in Doriath as the loremaster and Minstrels of King Thingol during the First Age. He was also a skilled linguist and invented the Cirth alphabet in ., p. 106
==History==
When Fingolfin, King of the Noldor, held his great feast near the Pools of Ivrin only two came out of Doriath to attend, Daeron and Mablung, sent by King Thingol as messengers.
Daeron loved Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian the Maiar, but she did not love him. Nevertheless they were good friends, and Lúthien would often dance to his music.  After Daeron found out about Lúthiens love for the mortal Beren, he betrayed them both to Thingol. When Lúthien later sought his help in assisting captive Beren, Daeron again betrayed her to Thingol, though this time in love and fear for her rather than jealousy.
After Lúthien departed in secret from Doriath, Daeron repented and set out to search for her. He never did find her and never returned to Doriath either, passing over the Ered Luin into the East where he apparently dwelt long after.
Daeron is mentioned as one of the greatest minstrels of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and only Maglor son of Fëanor is said to come close to his skill.  Also in the Lay of Leithian there is named one called Tinfang Gelion who is counted among the three great minstrels, along with Maglor and Daeron.
==Etymology==
The name derives from the Sindarin word daer ("large, great")., p. 11
In the earlier Etymologies the Doriathrin name is given as Dairon shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, dai., p. 354 entry DAY
Consequently, Christopher Tolkien speculated in The Silmarillion, that the name perhaps included the Sindarin word dae "shadow".
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier versions of the mythology as set out in The History of Middle-earth, Daeron was originally envisioned as Lúthiens brother., p. 10  Daerons name went through a number of changes before J.R.R. Tolkien settled upon the final form - first it was Kapalen, then Tifanto, then Dairon, before Daeron., Note 9, p. 49
