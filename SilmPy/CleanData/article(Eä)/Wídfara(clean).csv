Wídfara was a man of Rohan during the War of the Ring.
==History==
His home was in the Wold, the wild grasslands of Rohans northern border, and in these northern lands he had acquired a special weather-sense. He followed Théoden to Minas Tirith and it was he who first reported a change in the wind during the long ride, a change that augured the end of Saurons looming darkness. He fought in the ensuing Battle of the Pelennor Fields., entry "Widfara"
