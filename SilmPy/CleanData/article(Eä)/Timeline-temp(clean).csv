== Commentary ==
The actual lengths of Valian Ages and Years is in great dispute. In the The Annals of Aman (1958) Tolkien said the original intent of the Valar was to make the Sun and the Moon so that ten solar years (SY) was one Valian Years (VY). However, this was no so, and it ended up that it was slightly less than ten. The breakdown was such that 958.2 SY = 100 VY = 1 Age.
However, in an essay titled "Aman", which was probably an introduction to Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth, written only one year later, Tolkien made it clear that a Valian Year was the aging of all things in Arda, or 144 solar years. This would coincide with what was written in Appendix D to The Lord of the Rings, which it is said that elves have more time allotted to them, and their "year" (1 yén) is 144 solar years.
However, Tolkiens entire chronology since some of his earliest writings has had a timeline based on approximately 1000 SY = 100 VY = 1 Age. It is unlikely he would suddenly dispose of all that one year after having created an elaborate chronology.
I have found it to be like this, though:
144 / 9.582 = approx. 15
9.582 x 15 = 143.73, leading me to believe a yén is really 143.73 SY. This is reinforced by the fact that Tolkien wrote that the original intent of the Valar concerning the length of a solar year was disturbed.
143.73 x 365.25 (days in a year) = approx. 52,497 days in a yen. (the additional fraction isnt important)
52,497 / 350 (what Tolkien says was the original intent for days in a year) = 149.99, or 150 SY in a yen as the Valars original intent.
Because the intended number of SY per yén came out not only to be a whole number, but a multiple of ten, I believe that this displays two different modes of reckoning time. The Valar, according to Aman, perceived the aging of Arda occured over intervals of one yén, what would become 143.73 solar years (original intent of 150). In my opinion, they then, for convenience, made their "Valian Year" 1/15 part of a yén. An "age" simply became 100 Valian Years, leaving a yén having no direct relation to an age. In the following chronology, I give the Valian Years and the yéni during which an event took place, as to show the natural aging of Arda.

N.B. - before the rising of the sun, all years given = 9.582 solar years
