Archet was the most remote of the settlements of the Bree-land, set among the trees on the northern edge of the Chetwood, somewhat to the east of Bree itself. A few hobbits lived there, but the inhabitants were predominantly Big Folk.
When the hobbits and Gandalf returned to Bree after their journey south, Barliman Butterbur told them of the fight within Bree in which some Bree-landers were killed.  After the fight the robbers took to hiding in the woods beyond Archet. 
==Etymology==
The name Archet is said to be an "English place-name of Celtic origin", sharing the element chet "wood" with Chetwood#Etymology., p. 765 Mark T. Hooker has suggested that the element Wiktionary:ar-#Old_Irish is a prefix meaning "nearby", found in several Welsh place-names. The meaning of Archet would thus be "near the woods", which Hooker notes describes its geographic position "on the edge of the Chetwood".Mark T. Hooker, A Tolkienian Mathomium, p. 8
Its form suggests a natural evolution of a Celtic word borrowed in the Old English times as Arcet, to the modern English.
Archet is equivalent to the real-life Welsh name Wikipedia:Argoed, with the same meaning "By the woods".

2007: The Lord of the Rings Online:
:Archet is the settlement players start at if they are Hobbits or of the Race of Man. During the Bree-land Introduction of the The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar it comes under attack by Blackwolds brigands who burn many of the homes to the ground. The settlement is commanded by Captain Brackenbrook, a retired sell-sword, but command passes on to his son, Jon Brackenbrook, when his father is killed in the attack.
