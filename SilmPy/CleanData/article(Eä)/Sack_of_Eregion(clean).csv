The Sack of Eregion was the campaign in which Sauron destroyed Eregion to find the three Elven Rings of power or to find out where they are by torture. He also scattered the Elves that lived there.
==Background==
Sauron first came to Ost-in-Edhil around  disguised as an emissary of the Valar offering his knowledge to Gwaith-i-Mírdain. He was called Annatar, Lord of the Gifts. Annatar taught Gwaith-i-Mírdain the craft of making Rings of Power. Based on the knowledge gained from Annatar, Celebrimbor created the Three Rings: Vilya, Narya and Nenya.
However, Sauron secretly forged the One Ring in Orodruin, the mountain of Mordor. Celebrimbor sent the Three away for safekeeping - Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad, and Nenya to Galadriel - and then prepared for war.
==Opposing Forces==
Sauron commanded a great host of evil men, orcs, and other creatures. No number can be certain, but considering the time it likely was a force of many tens of thousands. Enough to be able to challenge and destroy not just Hollin, but the great kingdoms of Lindon and Khazad-dûm.
As with Saurons forces it cannot be certain the number of troops the Elves or Dwarves deployed. However it can be speculated that there were at least several thousand Elves, and several thousand Dwarves; whose inhabitants in Khazad-dûm were at their height.
==The Battle==
Sauron marched through Eriador until he came to Ost-in-Edhil. He sacked the city and took Celebrimbor prisoner.
