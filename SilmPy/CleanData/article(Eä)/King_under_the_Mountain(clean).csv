King under the Mountain was the title taken by Thráin I, founder of the Dwarf-kingdom of Lonely Mountain, and maintained by those Kings of Durins Folk who dwelt there. The line was broken twice, once by Thorin I (he and four generations of his descendants ruled from the Grey Mountains, not Lonely Mountain), and once by the Dragons Smaug (who claimed the title for himself). In both cases, the line was restored to a rightful heir.

==Inspiration==
The term "Wikipedia:King under the Mountain" is a philological term for a certain motif in various mythologies and folklore around the world. It refers to a kingly figure who remains hidden in a mountain or cave until a messianic return at the appointed time.
According to the Wikipedia article, the motif is also present at several points in J.R.R. Tolkiens legendarium: Ar-Pharazôn with his Great Armament was buried in the Caves of the Forgotten beneath the Pelóri until the Dagor Dagorath; the King of the Dead and the Oathbreakers in Dunharrow, who returned to fulfill their oath; and of course the King under the Mountain himself, with Thorins return to Erebor. Other figures can include Fëanor and Túrin (said to return from the dead at the Dagor Dagorath); and the Kings of Gondor (with Aragorn as the returned King).
