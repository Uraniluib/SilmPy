The Springle-ring was a dance of the Shire-hobbits. It was described as "a pretty dance, but rather vigorous" where dancers leaped up often.
At the Bilbos Farewell Party the dance was performed by Everard Took and Melilot Brandybuck. The dance is also mentioned in the Bucklandish poem Bombadil Goes Boating, witnessed by the daughters of Farmer Maggot.
==Etymology==
The word Wiktionary:springle#English has several meanings in English, however Tolkien commented that the name is made-up, ought to evoke the style of the dance.
Robert Foster gives the erroneous translation "war-horse ring"., p. 363Cf. http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=79495&start=30 Forum discussion: "...although where this information proceeds from is not given (springle does not seem to be a synonym for war-horse in any online dictionary)."
