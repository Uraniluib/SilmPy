Fimbul was an Orcs who was part of Azogs pack that was pursuing Thorin and Company in the The Hobbit (film series). He was played by Stephen Ure.
==History==
When Azog had Yazneg killed for his failure to catch the company of Dwarves as they headed toward Rivendell, Fimbul became Azogs new lieutenant.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Once Bolg took over leadership of the pack when Azog was summoned back to Dol Guldur by the Sauron, he continued to serve as lieutenant. When the pack finally caught up to the Company again in Lake-town, Fimbul was the one who notified Bolg that Thorin and most of the Company had already gone. Almost immediately after that, a slain Orc fell into the boat Fimbul was sitting in at that moment, launching him into the air, only to be decapitated by Legolas (who happened to be on the balcony of Bards house at that moment).The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
