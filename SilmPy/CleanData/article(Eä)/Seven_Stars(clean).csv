Seven Stars is a common symbol throughout Arda.
It refers to the constellation that turns through the northern skies every night of the year. To the Elves this was the Valacirca that signalled the downfall of Morgoth, but the Men of the Northern lands called it simply Valacirca. The Seven Stars are today known as the Plough, or the Big Dipper.
The Doors of Durin also displayed seven stars with a crown, probably representing Durins Crown.
Seven Stars was also the symbol of Elendil, the leader of the Faithful, and his heirs, representing the seven ships of the Faithful with a Palant√≠ri. The Crown of Gondor bore seven jewels of adamant set in the circlet.
