Nimloth (died ) was an elf-maid of Doriath, the daughter of Galathil.
== History ==
In  she wedded Dior, King Thingols heir, and for a time lived with him by the Lanthir Lamath waterfall at the base of the Blue Mountains. There she gave birth to Elwing, Eluréd, and Elurín. In 504, after the murder of King Thingol, she returned to Doriath with her husband and became Queen of Doriath. Their reign was short-lived, however, as the Sons of Fëanor assaulted Menegroth and slew both her and Dior. This was the Second Kinslaying. Her youngest children, Eluréd and Elurín, were left in the forest to die by the servants of Celegorm. Elwing, however, escaped to the Mouths of Sirion. Years later she would wed Eärendil and together they would gain aid from Valinor.
