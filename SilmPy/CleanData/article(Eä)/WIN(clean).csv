In the The Etymologies appears the deleted root GWIN ("new, fresh"), with the derivatives Quenya vinya ("new, fresh, young"), Noldorin bîn. J.R.R. Tolkien also experimented with a derivative ?Avarin Gwinarn. The root GWIN was linked to GWEN., p. 16
In a manuscript associated with the essay Eldarin Hands, Fingers & Numerals appears another deleted stem: WINI ("little"), perhaps intending to explain Quenya wine, winimo ("baby").
