Mount Doom, or Orodruin (Sindarin, pron.  in three syllables), was a volcano in Mordor. 
==History==
Melkor created Mount Doom in the First Age, and the name "Mordor" may have been given to the surrounding land before Sauron settled there because of its eruptions., p. 390 (note 14). When Sauron chose the land of Mordor as his dwelling-place in the Second Age, Orodruin was the reason for his choice. He "used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging."  The most famous result of his forging, and in fact the only one we know of for sure, was the One Ring. 
The mountain erupted in  signalling Saurons attack to Gondor and it took the name Amon Amarth "Mount Doom".
In  Mount Doom reawakened and the last inhabitants of Ithilien terrified fled over Anduin. From then on it erupted sporadically until the end of the Age.
The Fellowship of the Rings Quest for the Ring in the War of the Ring was to destroy the Ring at Mount Doom.
==Description==

It stood alone in an empty plain, the Plateau of Gorgoroth and was connected to the Barad-d√ªr with Saurons Road, rising about 4500 feet with its base about 3000 feet tall.Robert Foster, The Complete Guide to Middle-earth entry "Orodruin" The Road approached the east side of the base at a causeway and then wound up like a snake; at that point the Road seemed damaged by the lava and re-repaired several times.Karen Wynn Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle-earth, p. 146
Inside its cone, were the Cracks of Doom leading to the Crack of Doom, a fiery chasm where the One Ring was forged.
==Etymology==
Mount Doom is the Westron translation of Amon Amarth in Gondor.
The name was given because the volcano was linked in ancient and little-understood prophecies with the final end of the Third Age, when the One Ring was found again., pp. 768-9
==Theories==
According to Karen Fonstad, the Mount Doom was obviously a Wikipedia:stratovolcano, composited by alternating layers of ash and lava. Towering at only 4500ft, it was relatively short.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
2001-03: The Lord of the Rings (film series):
:Wikipedia:Mount Ngauruhoe was used as Mount Doom in some scenes. In long shots the mountain is either a large model or a CGI effect, or a combination. It was not permitted to film the summit of Ngauruhoe because it is sacred to the Maori of the region. However, some scenes which showed the slopes of Mount Doom were filmed on the actual slopes of Wikipedia:Mount Ruapehu.
