Durthang was an old fortress in the northern Mordor. It stood in the northern Ephel Dúath, on the slopes above Udûn (valley), overlooking Morannon and the Carach Angren.
==History==
Durthang was originally a stronghold of Gondor, constructed during the early Third Age for overlooking the entrance to Mordor in the aftermath of the War of the Last Alliance. However, as Gondor’s power declined, Durthang was eventually abandoned, and by  Mordor was left unguarded. The land became repopulated with Sauron’s servants, and Durthang eventually became an Orcs stronghold.
During the War of the Ring, a troop of Orcs from Durthang caught up with a band of Orcs that was marching eastward in Mordor. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were in that band, disguised as Orcs and they were forced to march along with the troop for some distance before they were able to slip away.
==Etymology==
Durthang is Sindarin containing the elements dûr "dark" and thang "oppression".
