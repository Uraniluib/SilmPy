Princess Mika Milovana was one of three who survived the destruction of Dale by the dragon Smaug, the others being a watchman and Thorin.
The Princess got angry when Bilbo Baggins refused to accept his prophesied role of the dragon slayer and declared that she would go alone to the Lonely Mountain. Dismayed that a child should enter into such peril, Bilbo agreed to go.
After Bilbo had killed Slag, Dale was restored. Bilbo and Mika reigned there together for a time before they returned to Hobbiton.
