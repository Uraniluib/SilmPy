aeg is a noun meaning "point" in Sindarin. Compare ecthel, "spear point".
Examples:
* Egalmoth = "A Spike upon a Flowered Crest"
* aeglos (spear) = "icicle"
== Conflicting Definition ==
Earlier in J.R.R. Tolkien development of Sindarin, aeg meant "fell" or "dire" and was the equivalent of the Quenya aica. Tolkien later rejected this definition, deciding that aeg only translated as "point". This complicated the translations of some names, as Tolkien never developed another Sindarin equivalent for aica.
Example:
* Aegnor = "Fell Fire"
