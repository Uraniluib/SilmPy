== Etymology ==
The word Mearas comes from Old English mēaras, simply meaning "horses". Its singular form would be Wiktionary:mearh#Old_English or marh. Robert Foster in his The Complete Guide to Middle-earth incorrectly displays the singular as Meara.
 
The root marh can be seen in the names of the Northmen Marhwini and Marhari (which are actually Gothic), note 6 as well as Marcho.
