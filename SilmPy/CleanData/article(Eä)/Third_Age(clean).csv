The Third Age, often abbreviated to T.A., began after the first downfall of Sauron, when he was defeated by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men following the downfall of Númenor. 
This age was characterized by the rise and decline of the exiled Númenorean kingdoms, the slow recovery of Saurons power, and, also known as the Fading Years, the waning of the Elves.
It lasted for 3021 years, until Sauron was again defeated, this time finally, when his The One Ring was destroyed. When Elrond and the Three Rings left Middle-earth for the Valinor, the Fourth Age began.
