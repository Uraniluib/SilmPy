The Gate of Mordor (also the gates of Mordor) was a term for the defended pass in the northwest of Mordor, and great Black Gate - the Morannon - that protected it. The Gates opened onto a narrow valley, Ud√ªn (valley), and were highly defensible. Indeed, they were only successfully assaulted once in their history, by the armies of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.
