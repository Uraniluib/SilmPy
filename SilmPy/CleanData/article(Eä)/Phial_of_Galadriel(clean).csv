Galadriel gave Frodo this gift upon the Fellowships departure from Lothl처rien. It would stay among his possessions unused until reaching the edge of Mordor.
As Frodo, Sam and Gollum approached the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, Frodo saw a great mass of cavalrymen led by the Witch-king. When the Witch-king stopped, Frodo feared they had been spotted; against his will, Frodo moves his hand towards the The One Ring. Instead, he touched  the Phial - which he had forgotten - and the Witch-king continued on his way.
Both Frodo and Samwise Gamgee used the phial to fend off the attacks of Shelob, and escape her Shelobs Lair on the borders of Mordor. Sam later used it to overcome the will of the Two Watchers at the Tower of Cirith Ungol. Sam also attempted to use the light in the Cracks of Doom but the light from the glass faded because they were in the heart of Saurons domain.
When Gollum led Frodo and Sam into Shelobs Lair, Frodo exclaimed in Quenya, "Aiya E채rendil Elenion Ancalima!", translating as "Hail E채rendil, brightest of stars!". This is in reference to the light of the star of E채rendil, the Silmarils he wore upon his brow, the brightest star in the sky. It was the light of this star which is trapped within the Star-glass.
Upon Frodos departure from Middle-earth, the light from the phial faded as it reached the shores of Eldamar.
