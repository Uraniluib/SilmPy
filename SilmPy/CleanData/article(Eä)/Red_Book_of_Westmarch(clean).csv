The Red Book of Westmarch (sometimes Red Book of the Hobbitsnath) is the book in which the legendarium of Middle-earth was written. It is bound in red leather.
The first Red Book was written as a diary by the Hobbits Bilbo Baggins and recounted his quest for Lonely Mountain, which he called There and Back Again. Within it, he compiled Elven lore while he retired to Rivendell (Translations from the Elvish)  where he gave it to Frodo.
Frodo organized Bilbos manuscript and used it to write down his own quest during the War of the Ring. Inscribed within, it reads:

My Diary. My Unexpected Journey.
There and Back Again.And What Happened After.
Adventures of Five Hobbits.
The Tale of the Great Ring,
compiled by Bilbo Baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends.
What we did in the War of the Ring.
THE DOWNFALL
OF THE
LORD OF THE RINGS
AND THE
RETURN OF THE KING
(as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs of Bilbo and Frodo of the Shire,
supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of the Wise.)
Together with extracts from Books of Lore translated by Bilbo in Rivendell.

The book contained Bilbos translations of Elven legends from the Elder Days, and various Hobbit poems. A lot of background information on the realms of Arnor, Gondor, and Rohan was added to it by Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck from their contacts in Rohan and Gondor. Other material was provided by Aragorn.
After Bilbo and Frodo left for Valinor, the Red Book passed into the keeping of Samwise Gamgee, the Mayor of Michel Delving. The book was left in the possession of Sam Gamgees eldest daughter, Elanor Gardner, and her descendants (the Fairbairn Family of the Towers or Warden of Westmarch). 
The original book was formed from Bilbos private diary and attached to it, in a single red case, were three large volumes bound in red leather. There was a fifth volume containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship. Several copies, with various notes and later additions, were made and copies were passed on to future generations, of which one, the "Thains Book", is the most important.
The "original" version of the Red Book contained the story of Bilbos journey as it originally stood: thus, Gollum willingly gives the One Ring to Bilbo, and there is no trace of the Rings hold over Gollum. Later copies of the Red Book contained, as an alternative, also the true account (later written in by Frodo), where Bilbo comes across the Ring by accident.
==Inspiration==

Tolkiens inspiration for this repository of lore was the real Wikipedia:Red Book of Hergest, the early 15th century compilation of Welsh history and poetry that contains the manuscript of the Mabinogion. Bound (and rebound) in red leather, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, the manuscript was well known to Tolkien.
In the first edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkiens foreword claimed he had translated the Red Book from the original Westron into English, and it therefore must be supposed that copies of the book survived throughout several Ages.
