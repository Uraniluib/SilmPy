The Pelóri (Quenya, pron. ) were the mountain-fence of Aman. The highest peak of the Pelóri was Taniquetil, on which were the mansions of Manwë and Varda.
==History==
The Pelóri were raised by the Valar to defend against the evils of Morgoth after he destroyed their original dwelling-place at Almaren.
They were the tallest of all mountains, and the tallest of the Pelóri was Taniquetil, on which stood the high mansions of Manwë and Varda. Behind them to the West, the Light of the Trees shone, but the narrow shores beneath their eastern feet were in darkness.
The second highest of the Pelóri was Hyarmentir above Avathar.
When the Eldar came to Aman, the Valar cut a rift in the Mountains, the Calacirya, to let the Light shine through them. In that pass, the Vanyar and the Noldor built the city of Tirion, and the Pass of Light looked out onto the Bay of Eldamar and lit the isle of Tol Eressëa, where the Teleri dwelt in those ancient days.
==Etymology==
The Quenya name Pelóri translates as "the fencing or defensive heights". In a manuscript, J.R.R. Tolkien connects the name to Quenya pelo ("a boundary (fence)") and pella ("beyond"), deriving from Sundocarme PEL., p. 92 Christopher Tolkien suggested that the first element derives from PEL ("fence, enclosure"). The second element is likely orot, "mountain".
The Pelóri were also called the Mountains of Aman and the Mountains of Defence.
==In other stories==
The Pelóri - as the Mountains of Elvenholme - are referenced in Tolkiens Roverandom. In the story, written down in 1927, the great whale Uin takes the enchanted dog Rover (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the Shadowy Seas to the Bay of Eldamar beyond the Enchanted Isles where Rover saw the Mountains of Elvenhome and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of Tirion., pp. 73-4
