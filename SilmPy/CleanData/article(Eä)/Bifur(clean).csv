__NOTOC__
:Due to the Orcs axe stuck in his head, Bifur can only speak Khuzdul through most of the film series. In the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition) of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, he loses the axe during the Battle of Five Armies. After head-butting an Orc, the axe becomes stuck in his opponents head; after the two are separated with help from Bofur and Bombur, he declines Bomburs offer to put it back, and is able to speak Westron again.
