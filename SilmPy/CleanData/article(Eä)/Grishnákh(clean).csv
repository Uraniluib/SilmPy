Grishnákh was a captain of Orcs from Mordor.  He was described as being a short, crook-legged creature, broad, with long arms hanging almost to the ground.
==History==
On 26 February  Grishnákh was part of a raiding party that captured Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took at Parth Galen. He was the captain of a group of Mordor-orcs which had joined Uglúks forces on the plains of Rohan during the War of the Ring.  When Pippin awoke and heard the Orcs arguing he noted that Grishnákhs voice sounded softer but more evil than the others.  Grishnákh threatened to report the doings of the mountain-orcs and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz (Barad-dûr).
On 28 February Grishnákh and his followers split from Uglúks company to head east, but fell back in with the Isengarders when Éomers riders drew near.  In the nighttime when he had a chance, Grishnákh attempted to search the hobbits for the One Ring (how he knew about it is unknown; possibly he was present at the torture and interrogation of Gollum in Barad-dûr).  After hearing Pippin imitate Gollums croaking noise, he believed they had the One Ring and tried to escape with the two hobbits.  Before he could accomplish this he was slain by the Riders of Éomer near the eaves of Fangorn Forest.
