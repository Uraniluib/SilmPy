Palisor was a name used by J.R.R. Tolkien in his early legendarium for the mid-most region of the Great Lands. In Palisor lay the Cuivi√©nen, where the Elves awoke., p. 114f
The Dark Elves stayed back in Palisor, and in the unfinished Gilfanons Tale we learn that the Hisildi were ruled by the sprites Tu, whose dwelling was in the caves below the Waters of Awakening. East of Palisor was the Murmenalda where the Men awoke.
In the outlines of that story, Palisor was the site of the Battle of Palisor, where Elves and Men fought against Fankils Dwarves and/or goblins.
==Conceptual confusion==
In The History of Middle-earth Index, Palisor is correctly described as the region where "the Elves awoke", in the index for The Book of Lost Tales Part One and The Book of Lost Tales Part Two. However, in the index for The Shaping of Middle-earth and The Lost Road and Other Writings, Palisor is described to be the region where "the first Men awoke". A misconception is likely to have entered the index, as none of the page references point to any other usage of the name Palisor than the birth-place of the Elves.
==Etymology==
According to Christopher Tolkiens reading of the Qenya Lexicon, Palisor is derived from the root PALA, "whose derivatives have a common general sense of flatness, among them palis sward, lawn, whence no doubt Palisor.", p. 264
