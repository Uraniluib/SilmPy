The Yellow Mountains were a range of mountains to the south-east of Middle-earth within the Dark Land, a southern continuation of the Orocarni. Both ranges were created when the Valar thrust the centre of Middle-earth to the east as extra protection for Valinor. p. 239
In the Ambarkanta maps, the Yellow Mountains are not shown on Map V, labelled "After the War for the Sake of the Elves".
