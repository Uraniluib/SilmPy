In the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Azanulbizar the surviving Dwarves were unable to properly dispose of their dead, having neither the time nor the resources to build stone tombs and refusing to bury their fallen comrades in earth, this being against their traditions.  Therefore they had no choice but to burn the corpses.  Any Dwarf whose relative was killed in the battle would proudly say he was a Burned Dwarf, thus declaring that his or her ancestor fought and fell in that terrible conflict. Balin and Dwalin father Fundin, Thorin Oakenshield younger brother Frerin and Dain Ironfoot father Náin (son of Grór) were all among the Burned Dwarves of Azanulbizar.
