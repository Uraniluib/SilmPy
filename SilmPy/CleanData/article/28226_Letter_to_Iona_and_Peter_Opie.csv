*'''Background and contents:''' On the occasion of several letters, concerned with the word 'faynights',<ref group="note">''Faynights!'' (also: ''fainits!; fain I!; fains!; fain it!; fainites!''): A shout (often accompanied by crossed fingers) used by UK schoolchildren to call a playground truce. (Source: Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor (Eds.), (2007), ''The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''.)</ref> having been published in ''Sunday Times'', Iona and Peter Opie sent a letter to the newspaper, explaining the use of the word (published on 25 November 1951). Tolkien read their letter, and wrote a long letter in reply, discussing the etymology of 'faynights'. He wrote that he read their letter "''today, just as I had been puzzling over a curious [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] usage''" apparently connected with the issue.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 379</ref>. In their work ''[[The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren]]'', Iona and Peter Opie quoted from Tolkien's letter, that states, amongst other things, that the terms 'fains I', 'fains' and 'fainites' are survivals of [[Middle English|medieval English]] from the 14th Century.<ref>[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=51415 Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. 1973] at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ Tolkienbooks.net] (accessed 26 November 2011)</ref>
