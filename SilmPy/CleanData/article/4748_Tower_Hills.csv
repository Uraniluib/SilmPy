The '''Tower Hills''' ([[Sindarin|Sind.]] ''Emyn Beraid'') were a range of hills at the west end of [[Eriador]]. They lay east of [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]], the Grey Havens of [[Lindon]], and west of the [[White Downs]], of old the border of [[the Shire]].

High upon the Tower Hills stood three tall [[Elves|Elven]] towers, the [[White Towers]], the highest of which was called ''[[Elostirion]]'', which held a ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]''.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}, Note 2</ref>

==History==
Although [[Gil-galad]]'s kingdom didn't have clear bounds south of the [[Lune]], the [[Elves of Lindon]] maintained an outpost there.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

In {{SA|600}}, when the first ship of the [[Númenóreans]] sailed up the [[Gulf of Lune]] there was a meeting between the men from the sea and their [[Middle Men|distant kinsmen]] in the Hills.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

The White Towers upon the Tower Hills were built before the end of the [[Second Age]] by [[Gil-galad]] for his friend [[Elendil]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

During the [[Third Age]], [[Wandering Companies|bands of Elves]] would go in pilgrimage to Elostirion in order to have a glimpse of the West through the [[Elostirion-stone]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> The Stone remained in its tower until the end of the Age; it was then taken back into the West.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

In {{FoA|31}} the [[Westmarch]] was added to [[the Shire]], making the Tower Hills the new western border of the land. Three years later [[Thain]] [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin I]] made [[Fastred of Greenholm]] the first Warden of Westmarch. He and his wife [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]], daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]], moved to the Tower Hills and founded the town of [[Undertowers]] on the eastern slopes.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>
