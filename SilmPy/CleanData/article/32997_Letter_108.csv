==Summary==
Tolkien returned his revised manuscript of ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', having made many alterations which he hoped and thought were for the better.  He pointed out that the story was not written for children.  He emphasized that it had been specially composed for reading out loud, and had been written for reading to the Lovelace Society at [[wikipedia:Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]].  Tolkien wanted to include an inscription to C.H. Wilkinson<ref group="note">The English tutor at Worcester College</ref> since it was he who egged him to write it and to publish it.
