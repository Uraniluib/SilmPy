'''Foresight''' is a gift or power apparently given to picked [[Elves]] and [[Men]].  Many elves appear to have varying amounts of foresight, while some of the more noble men ([[Númenóreans]]/[[Dúnedain]]) appear to have degrees of foresight on special occasions. 

Elven mothers would give their children a name, known as [[amilessë|amilesse apacenyo]], having insight into the characters and abilities of their children, and many also had the gift of prophetic foresight.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''Note on Mother-names'', p. 339</ref>

There are several mentions of ''[[Seers]]'' or ''Prophets'' namely [[Amnon]], [[Glirhuin]] and [[Malbeth]]. Foresight was also seen in dreams: [[Frodo Baggins]] saw prophetic dreams during his adventure,<ref>{{HM|FR}}</ref> and [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]] saw a puzzling dream, prompting Boromir to travel to [[Rivendell]] to seek counsel.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>
