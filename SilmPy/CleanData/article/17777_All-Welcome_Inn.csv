The '''All-Welcome Inn''' was an inn in [[the Shire]], just west of [[Frogmorton]], where the [[Northway]] met the [[East Road]]. It was to be one of the stops of [[Thorin and Company]].<ref>{{HH|T1}}, p. 815</ref>

This establishment was named only in the 1960 rewrite of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' which was never completed.
