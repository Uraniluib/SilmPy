'''Aredhel''', also called '''Ar-Feiniel''' or the ''White Lady of the Noldor'', was the third child and only daughter of [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]], and [[Anairë]] who herself was also a [[Noldo]]. Her elder brothers were [[Fingon]] and [[Turgon]], and her youngest brother was ([[Argon]]), not mentioned in the published [[Silmarillion]] but in earlier versions. Much later in [[Beleriand]], she became the mother of [[Maeglin]] whose father was [[Eöl]], "the Dark Elf".

Aredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests.  Her skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.  She was fond of the sons of [[Fëanor]], especially [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]].

== History ==
Aredhel was born in [[Valinor]] and most likely at [[Tirion]], the city of the [[Noldor]] in [[Aman]]. In the flight of the Noldor from Aman, she followed her father Fingolfin and her brothers over the [[Helcaraxë]] to [[Middle Earth]]. But Aredhel's mother Anairë did not go, even though all of her children were going with her husband Fingolfin.

After arriving in [[Middle-earth]], she dwelt for a time in [[Nevrast]] where her brother Turgon established the city of [[Vinyamar]]. Later, when Turgon built the hidden city of [[Gondolin]], Aredhel went with her brother and his daughter, Idril, to dwell thereafter in Gondolin. After two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her and she asked her brother, now [[King Turgon]] of Gondolin, for permission to leave. Nevertheless, Turgon was unwilling at first, because he feared for her safety and for the secrecy of his kingdom. He eventually relented, giving her a small escort of lords among his people for protection. Aredhel ignored her brother's plea that she would only go to see their eldest brother Fingon, desiring instead to meet the [[Sons of Fëanor]] again. They sought passage through [[Doriath]], but were denied because they were of the Noldor. Aredhel and her companions were then forced to go northward through the treacherous region of [[Nan Dungortheb]] north of Doriath, where they were separated being entangled in the dark shadows. Notwithstanding, Aredhel continued alone onward to [[Himlad]], the land of the Noldorin Elf-lords Celegorm and Curufin where they lived and upon reaching Himlad she only found them away in [[Thargelion]]. Aredhel dwelt in Himlad with the people of Celegorm who welcomed her while she waited for Celegorm and Curufin to return. But after awhile, she got tired of waiting for them, and began taking trips of her own to pass the time. It was on one such trip that Aredhel wandered into the dark forest of [[Nan Elmoth]].

[[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] lived there, and upon seeing Aredhel's beauty, wove a spell which caused her to become hopelessly lost and wander ever closer to his home. Eöl revealed himself when she arrived, and welcomed her to his house. They married and had a son named [[Maeglin]]. During this time, Aredhel was free to go where she pleased, with the sole restriction that she couldn't visit any of her kin. Her homesickness led her to tell Maeglin many stories about Gondolin and the Noldor, which only increased her longing for home. Thus, when Maeglin proposed that they abandon Nan Elmoth and return to Gondolin, she responded with pride and joy. 

Waiting until Eöl was away, the two fled from Nan Elmoth for Gondolin, but were unknowingly tracked by Eöl, who had discovered their disappearance earlier than expected. Aredhel and Maeglin were received with joy in Gondolin, but the guards quickly caught Eöl and brought him to the King on Aredhel's bidding. Turgon was initially willing to spare Eöl and accept him as a kinsman if he remained in Gondolin, but Eöl would not accept this judgement and chose death for himself and Maeglin. He threw a javelin at his son, but Aredhel shielded Maeglin and was wounded. While she lay resting, she spoke to her niece Idril and begged her to ensure Turgon showed mercy to Eöl. This was not to be, as the weapon Eöl used had been poisoned. Aredhel died shortly after making this final plea, leaving the city and its King bereaved once more.

== Etymology ==
Aredhel's name in [[Valinor]] used to be '''''Írissë'''''. In [[Sindarin]] this name was ''Íreth''.<ref>{{PM|XI}}, p. 345</ref>

The name ''Aredhel'' means "Noble Elf" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 139</ref> Note on pronunciation: Aredhel should be pronounced ''ar-eth-el'' (voiced "th", [ð]), not ''ar-ed-hel''.

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
The names ''Aredhel'' and ''Ar-Feiniel'' ("noble white lady") were both originally intended to stand alone, and be used as the main name of Irissë. While preparing ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' for publication [[Christopher Tolkien]] could not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name, and he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series was possibly mistaken.

An earlier version of her name was Isfin.
