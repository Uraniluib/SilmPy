The '''Wainriders''' were a people, or confederacy, of [[Men]] from the [[East]]. They journeyed in great wagons, and their chieftains rode chariots in battle.<ref name="Gondor"/> They camped in fortified camps of wagons. Their young women were also trained in arms, and they, along with old men and youths, stayed behind, able to defend their homes from attackers.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

These [[Easterlings]] were stirred by [[Sauron]] to descend upon [[Gondor]] and its allies, some two centuries after the time of the [[Great Plague]]; being better armed than previous invaders, they remained a dire threat to the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]] for nearly a hundred years.

==History== 
The Wainriders entered history in {{TA|1851}}. They quickly overran  [[Rhovanion]] and soon came to battle with [[Gondor]] itself.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  In {{TA|1856}} [[Narmacil II]] was lost in battle, and for a time all of Gondor's possessions east of [[Anduin]] were lost to it.  Narmacil's son [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] won a temporary reprieve in {{TA|1899|n}} when the enslaved [[Northmen]] revolted against the Wainriders, and he took advantage to defeat the Wainriders on the plain of [[Dagorlad]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

After that defeat, the Wainriders planned a crushing revenge. Allying themselves with the [[Haradrim|Men]] of [[Near Harad]] and [[Khand]], they orchestrated a simultaneous assault on Gondor from the north and the south, and the South-kingdom came close to destruction.<ref name="Gondor"/>  In {{TA|1944}}<ref name="TA"/> King [[Ondoher]] was lost in the northern battles, but his general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] defeated the southern invaders. The victorious Wainrider army in the north, celebrating their victory over Ondoher, suddenly found themselves set upon by Eärnil. In an encounter that became known as the [[Battle of the Camp]], the Wainriders were put to rout, and those that survived fled back to their eastern domains.<ref name="Gondor"/>

It was later seen that the invasions of the Wainriders, as so many of Gondor's perils, were engineered by the emissaries of Sauron.  While Gondor's control of the lands east of the Anduin had been lost, the borders of [[Mordor]] had been open, and during this time the [[Nazgûl]] had taken advantage of Gondor's plight to re-enter the land of their master.

==Inspiration==
[[Andreas Moehn]] notes that some ancient peoples traveled in wagons, such as the ''Hamaxobioi'' from Greek sources, or the Scythians.<ref>{{webcite|website=Lalaith|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articlename=The Men of Darkness|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Men_of_Darkness.html}} [''Amaxoluoi'' is an error].</ref>
