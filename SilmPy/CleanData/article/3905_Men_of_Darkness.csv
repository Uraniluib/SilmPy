'''Men of Darkness''' or '''Men of [[Shadow]]''' were the [[men]] of the east of [[Middle-earth]] who fell under the dominion of [[Morgoth]] in the [[First Age]] or were dominated by [[Sauron]] and worshipped him in the [[Second Age]]. In the [[Third Age]] they were moved by him against the [[Dúnedain]].

The Dúnedain used the term with no account of race, culture or language; it was a generic term for all those peoples who were not simply barbaric plunderers or brigands, but fanatically opposed the [[Realms in Exile]], the [[Free Peoples]] and their allies, as enemies of their "gods".<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

The following peoples can be considered Men of Darkness:
*[[Easterlings]] ([[Wainriders]], [[Balchoth]])
*[[Variags]]
*[[Black Númenóreans]] and [[Corsairs of Umbar]]
*[[Half-trolls]]
*[[Haradrim]]
*[[Dunlendings]]
*[[Hill-men]]
