'''''habar''''' (or '''''sabar''''')<ref group=note>''S'' usually mutates to ''H'' in Sindarin.</ref> is an unattested [[Sindarin]] word likely meaning "delved mine", being reconstructed from an element found in the compound names ''[[Anghabar|Ang'''habar''']]'' and ''[[Nornhabar|Norn'''habar''']]''.<ref name=DW>[[Didier Willis]], [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] at [http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com] (accessed 19 June 2011)</ref><ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 327</ref>

Note that this word is debatable as it is seen only in these compounds. [[Didier Willis]] has suggested that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] perhaps reused the old [[Qenya]] root SAPA "dig, excavate" as a base for this word.<ref>{{PE|12}}</ref><ref name=DW/> This seems likely, since SAP- and a derivative ''sapnā'' reappear in the 1950s' ''Outline of Phonology'' as the source for ''samna'' "delved hole, pit".<ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 86</ref>
