==Quotes==
{{quote|She's sort of grown up in a world of men; she's been brought up to fight, she's been brought up to ride. She's surrounded by men..and yet she's not allowed to be a man.|Miranda Otto on Éowyn}}

{{quote|The first day I arrived at [[Edoras]] was really memorable. We had an hour and a half drive to the set, and we came over the hill to see the [[Meduseld|Golden Hall]] built in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by these white covered mountains, exactly as described in the book. To feel as an actor that you had so much to work with was really exciting. It was like being a child thinking about being a princess and having a palace and then you wake up one morning and there it is.|Miranda Otto, [http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_editorials_otto_interview.html Lordoftherings.net]}}

{{quote|I thought, 'This is a story where a woman becomes her own knight in shining armour'. That's a great role model, because most mythic stories we're given as children are about women being saved by men.|Miranda Otto, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/11/21/miranda_otto_the_return_of_the_king_interview.shtml BBC interview]}}
