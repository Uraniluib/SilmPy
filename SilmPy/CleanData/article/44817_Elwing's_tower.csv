'''Elwing's tower''' was the white tower that was built for [[Elwing]] "upon the borders of the outer world, in the northern regions of the [[Sundering Seas]]".<ref>{{S|24}} from {{LR|Quenta}} (§12, p. 327).</ref> She dwelt in the tower where all the sea-birds came to rest, and devised white and silver-grey wings for herself so that she could fly to meet [[Eärendil]] who returned from his journeys from "beyond the confines of the world".<ref>{{S|24}} from {{LR|Quenta}} (§11, p. 327).</ref>

The "white tower" is not otherwise named in the [[Quenta Silmarillion]], only in the Index of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' it is called "Elwing's tower".<ref>{{LR|Index}} (p. 426 s.v. <i>Elwing</i>).</ref>

In the previous versions of the story Eärendel built the tower for himself, in the [[Sketch of the Mythology]] on an isle in the northern seas,<ref>{{SM|2}} (§17, p. 38 cf. p. 70). &ndash; There is even a short mention of "the northern tower on the [[Isle of Seabirds]]" in a note for [[The Tale of Eärendel]] from [[The Book of Lost Tales]] period ({{LT2|V}}, xvii, p. 264).</ref> and in the first version of the chapter 17 of [[The Quenta]] in the Northern Seas,<ref>{{SM|Q17}}, p. 150</ref>. In both of these versions Eärendel is alone and builds the tower when trying to find Elwing who is lost in the seas. 

But in the second version of The Quenta chapter 17 the wording is already quite similar to the Quenta Silmarillion: Eärendel builds the tower "upon the confines of the outer world in the Northern regions of the Sundering Seas",<ref>{{SM|Q17II}}, p. 154</ref> and for the first time Elwing is with him and aids him in his journeys.
