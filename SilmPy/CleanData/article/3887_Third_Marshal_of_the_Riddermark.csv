The '''Third Marshal of the Riddermark''' was the third of the three [[Riddermark|Marshals]] who commanded the forces of [[Rohan]]. Like the [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]], the Third Marshal had no fixed duties, and his role changed according to the needs of his King. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the Third Marshal was none other than [[Éomer]] son of [[Éomund]], whose base of operations was at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>
