}}'''Déor''' ([[Third Age]] 2644 – 2718, aged 74 years) was the seventh [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Druing Déor's kingship the peace of Rohan (which had begun during [[Aldor]]'s reign) came to an end - the [[Dunlendings]] took to raiding the herds and studs of the [[Rohirrim]] over the River [[Isen]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>  

When it became clear that the raiders were coming from near [[Isengard]], in {{TA|2710}} King Déor led an expedition to the north.  He found and defeated a host of Dunlendings, but discovered that [[Isengard]] was held by hostile forces.  Secure in the fortress they could not be dislodged and [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Egalmoth]] could not send help. Instead Déor kept a strong force of riders in the north of the [[Westfold]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Déor's reign lasted nineteen years. He was succeeded as King by his son, [[Gram]].

==Etymology==
Déor is an [[Old English]] word for "wild animal" ("deer") and also means "brave, bold".
