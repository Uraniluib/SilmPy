The '''Orocarni''' (also called the '''Red Mountains''') was a mountain range in the far north-east of [[Middle-earth]] made by the [[Valar]] after [[Morgoth|Melkor]] destroyed the [[Two Lamps]].<ref name=SMA4>{{SM|A4}}, p. 256</ref>

==Geography==
On the western slopes of the Orocarni grew the ''[[Wild Wood]]'', and near a great waterfall of a river that flowed into the Inland [[Sea of Helcar]] lay the bay of [[Cuiviénen]], where the first [[Elves]] woke.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref><ref>{{MR|Annals}}, p. 77, notes §41</ref> At their northern edge, the Orocarni came close to the [[Iron Mountains|Ered Engrin]],<ref name=SMA4/> similar to [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]] in the far north-west.

The locations of the four [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] clans who lived in the East are unknown; they might or might not have resided in the Orocarni. The distance between their mansions in the East and the [[Misty Mountains]], specifically [[Gundabad]], was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance from the [[Blue Mountains]] in the West.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref>
