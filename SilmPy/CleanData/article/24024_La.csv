The word can get pronominal endings as if a negative verb when a verb is not expressed, apparently where the phrase "is not" is followed by a noun or an adjective as a predicate, or where some verb is understood , as in English "I do not".

In another conceptual phase of Tolkien's, ''lá'' had the opposite meaning "yes".<ref name=VT42e/>

Tolkien considered that the negation could receive tense markers however he later reconsidered it. The tenses where ''la'' was attested are:
*''la'' (aorist)
*''laia'' (present)
*''láne'' (past)
*''alaie'' (perfect)
*''lauva'' (future)
==Inspiration==
In Arabic languages, "no" is ''la'a''. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] said himself that this negative form "''appears in [[Wikipedia:Semitic languages|Semitic]]''".<ref name=VT42e/>
