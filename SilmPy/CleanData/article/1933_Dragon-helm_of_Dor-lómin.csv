The '''Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin''', also known as the '''Helm of Hador''', was a visored steel helm, embossed and embellished with gold and runes, that bore as its crest an image of the head of [[Glaurung]]. It was said to bear an enchantment that protected its wearer from wounds and struck fear into the hearts of enemies.

== History ==
The helm was forged sometime after {{FA|260}} by the [[Dwarves|dwarf]]-smith [[Telchar]] for his lord [[Azaghâl]], who then gave it as a gift to [[Maedhros]]. He in turn passed it on to his cousin [[Fingon]]. In {{FA|416|n}} [[Fingolfin]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], created the fiefdom of [[Dor-lómin]] and made [[Hador]] the first [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. To celebrate the event Fingon presented Hador with the helm.

The Dragon-helm was crafted for a Dwarf and was too large and heavy for an [[Elves|Elf]]. Even [[Men]] found the helm was too massive, and only Hador and some of his descendants had the strength to wear it. He and his son [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] wore it often in combat, and their troops gained morale when they saw the massive crest towering over the other helms in battle. Unfortunately, Galdor didn't wear the helm when a host of orcs assaulted [[Eithel Sirion]], and was slain by an arrow. His son [[Húrin]] kept the helm but seldom wore it, being of shorter stature and greater pride. After his death, [[Morwen]] kept the helm, and sent it to [[Doriath]] with [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]].<ref>{{UT|2}}</ref>

The Helm was left in Doriath when Túrin fled it, but [[Beleg]] took it with him on his quest to find his friend. He delivered it when they met on [[Amon Rûdh]]. Túrin was monstrous in war and took one of his many titles from it: [[Gorthol]], the "Dread Helm". The [[Two Captains]] were known as "the Bow and the Helm" after their gear. 

The last clear record of the Dragon-helm is at the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], where Túrin is known to have worn it.
