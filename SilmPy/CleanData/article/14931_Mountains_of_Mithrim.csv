The '''Mountains of Mithrim''' were a range of mountains located in [[Hithlum]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  They formed the border between [[Mithrim]] and [[Dor-l√≥min]],<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and thus between the realms of [[Fingolfin]] and his son [[Fingon]] after the [[Noldor]] settled in Hithlum. The caves of [[Androth]], where some of the [[Elves of Mithrim|Grey-elves of Mithrim]] dwelt after [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]],<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> were probably in the Mountains of Mithrim.
