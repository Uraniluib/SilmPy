The '''father-name''' was the name given to an [[Elves|Elf]] at or near birth by his or her father, and was considered one of his or her 'true names'. It is one of the '''[[essë#anessi|anessi]]''', or given names, of [[High Elves]], along with the '''[[amilessë]]''' ("mother-name") and '''[[epessë]]''' ("after-name" or honorific). The father-name was a public name, announced in a ceremony called ''Essecarmë'' ("name-making").<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, p. 216</ref> It was often the primary name of an Elf until he or she chose to adopt an epessë given to them.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''Note on Mother-names'', p. 339</ref>

An example is [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], whose father-name was Findaráto ("[Golden-]Haired Champion")<ref name="Descend">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants'', p. 346</ref> and epessë was Felagund ("Hewer of Caves").<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The Dwarvish origin of the name Felagund'', p. 351</ref> The name Finrod is the [[Sindarin]] version of his father-name.
