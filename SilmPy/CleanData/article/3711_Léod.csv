'''Léod''' ({{TA|2459}} - {{TA|2501|n}}) was a [[Lord of the Éothéod]]. 

==History==
Léod was a great horseman and during his rule he captured a white foal that was wild and proud. When the horse was grown Léod tried to break him, but instead was thrown off and hit his head on a rock and died (he was but 42 and his son 16). His son [[Eorl]] later tamed the horse, naming him [[Felaróf]], and he would become the first of the great ''[[Mearas]]''.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>
