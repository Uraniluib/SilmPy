'''Erellont''' was one of the three mariners who accompanied [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] to [[Aman]], the other two being [[Aerandir]] and [[Falathar]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never specified the race of the three mariners: while it has been suggested that they were [[Men]],<ref>[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/aerandir.html Aerandir] at [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.asp Encyclopedia of Arda] (accessed 6 April 2011)</ref> others argue that they were [[Elves]].<ref>[http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=347256&page=73 War of the Silmarils] (game forum thread; accessed 6 April 2011)</ref>
==Etymology==

The meaning of ''Erellont'' is unknown. It has been speculated that the name means "lonely (star) ship" in [[Sindarin]],<ref group=note>In that case derived from ''[[ereb]]'' (+ ''[[êl|el]]'') + a possible derivative of [[LUT|LUT-]].</ref> or that the name is "''possibly a dialectal Sindarin of the Falas''" or even a "''combination of M[annish] and Elvish''".<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/26202 Erellont - name etymology] (message 26202; August 2, 2003) at [[Elfling]] (cf. replies)</ref>
