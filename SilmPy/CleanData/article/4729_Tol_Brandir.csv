'''Tol Brandir''', also called the '''Tindrock''' was one of the three peaks at the southern end of [[Nen Hithoel]].  Unlike [[Amon Hen]] to the west or [[Amon Lhaw]] to the east, Tol Brandir was a mountain-island; the [[Anduin]] split into two arms and flowed on both sides of the peak before rejoining and plunging over the falls of Rauros.  It was situated a little to the north of its companions and it was possible to paddle a boat across the river on it southern side above the waterfall.<ref>{{FR|II9}} and {{FR|II10}}</ref>

It was said that no foot of man or beast had ever been set upon Tol Brandir, which is understandable because its sides rose sheer out of the water.  High above the initial cliffs there were steep slopes with trees, but then more grey cliffs shot up with a final spire of stone at the top.  Being inaccessible to other creatures, many birds nested on the island.<ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Tol Brandir'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "Isle of the Great Steeples". Elements in the name are ''[[tol]]'' and ''[[brand (word)#Sindarin|brand]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 22</ref>

''Tindrock'', the [[Mannish]] word for the island, represents archaic [[Westron]] and contains the archaic English word ''tind'' 'spike'. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that if ''tind'' had survived into modern speech, it would have rhymed with ''find'' (/faɪnd/), since it now appears as ''tine'' 'prong'. <ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 777</ref> The name therefore would be pronounced as /taɪndɹɒk/.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the first map of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the island was named ''Tolondren'' and the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] landed upon it before crossing to the east bank of Nen Hithoel.<ref>{{TI|MIVa}}, p. 315</ref>  As Tolkien refined the geography the island was renamed the ''Isle of Emris''<ref>{{TI|MIVb}}, p. 317</ref> and then ''Tolbrandir''.<ref>{{TI|MIVc}}, p. 318</ref>  In the text, [[Celeborn]] first spoke of ''Toll-ondren''.  In pencil Tolkien altered the name to ''Eregon'', then to ''Brandor'', and then to ''the Tindrock that we call Tol Brandor''.<ref>{{TI|Farewell}}, p. 285</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001:''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''

:When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] cross to Amon Lhaw, they paddle across Nen Hithoel to the north of the island rather than to the south.  This is necessary because, unlike in the book, the river does not reach beyond Tol Brandir, instead the falls of Rauros are split by the pinnacle.
