'''Girdley Island''' was an island located in the [[Brandywine]] River, north of the [[Brandywine Bridge]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[David Salo]] suggests a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] etymology from *''Gyrdlieg'' "girdle-island".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

As in [[Rushey]], the ending ''[[Wiktionary:ey#Old_Norse|-ey]]'' means "island" in [[Old Norse]] and is found in English islandnames (cf. [[Wikipedia:Gurnsey#Etymology|Gurnsey]]).
