}}'''Curufin''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈkʊrʊfɪn]}}) was a [[Noldor]]in prince, the fifth of the [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]] of [[Fëanor]] and [[Nerdanel]]. Curufin was Fëanor's favorite and much like him in appearance, temperament, and skill. He was also the father of [[Celebrimbor]], master jewel-smith of [[Eregion]], who forged the three [[Elves|Elvish]] [[Rings of Power]].

==History==
====Flight of the Noldor====
[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 3.jpg|thumb|left|The Wife of Curufin|125px]]
Curufin was born in [[Tirion]] during the [[Years of the Trees]] and he 
received the name '''[[Curufinwë]]''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌkuruˈfinwe]}}), same as his father.  Because his father, uncles and brothers also all had father-names that ended with ''-[[finwë]]'', Curufin was called '''Curvo''' (Q, pron. {{IPA|[ˈkurvɔ]}}) by his family.  His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''Atarinkë''' (Q, pron. {{IPA|[ˌataˈriŋkɛ]}}).  While in [[Valinor]], he married at some point, and had a son named [[Celebrimbor]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, p. 318 (note 7)</ref>  

As with the other sons of Fëanor, Curufin bound himself by an [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] to recover his father's [[Silmarils]], which had been stolen by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. The Oath took him and his brothers to [[Endor]] during the [[First Age]] where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.

====Life in Beleriand====
Curufin dwelt with his brother [[Celegorm]] in [[Himlad]], a pass that led into Kingdom of [[Doriath]], which the two brothers fortified and held until the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. Following the battle, the two brothers were defeated and had to flee with their people to [[Nargothrond]], where their cousin [[Finrod]] welcomed them.

Shortly after, [[Beren]] also came to Nargothrond to ask for aid from Finrod, who had made an oath to help Beren's ancestor. Finrod decided to help Beren, but Celegorm and Curufin, remembering their own oath, persuaded the people of Nargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth, making them fearful.

Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of warriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew [[Orodreth]] ruled in his stead.

====The Attack upon Beren====
Later, Curufin and Celegorm went hunting with Celegorm's hound [[Huan]] and found [[Lúthien]], daughter of [[Thingol]], searching for Beren. Feigning to help her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for Celegorm had become enamored and would have Thingol give him her hand. However Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other thralls from [[Sauron]]. As these thralls returned, the people of Nargothrond perceived the two brother's treachery, and though Orodreth would not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond. 

The two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought with the latter. Defeated, he had to flee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot Beren instead. 

Because of Celegorm and Curufin's evil deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would not join the [[Union of Maedhros]] against Morgoth.

====Death====
Curufin fell in the [[Second Kinslaying]], when the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of the King [[Dior]] the Beautiful.  Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during the assault.

== Etymology ==
Curufin's [[father-name]] was ''[[Curufinwë]]'' ("Skillful [son of] [[Finwë]]"), the same father-name given to Fëanor. Because Curufin was Fëanor's favorite son, he chose to give him the same name. His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''Atarinkë'' ("Little Father"), choosen because of his physical resemblance to his father. The name Curufin is the [[Sindarin]] version of his father-name.  It is stated in [[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]] that of all the sons of Fëanor only Curufin did not prefer to use his mother-name.
