'''Shagrat''' was an [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]] commanding the garrison of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
During a patrol to [[Shelob's Lair]], Shagrat's company encountered a troop of Orcs from [[Minas Morgul]] led by [[Gorbag]]. The two did not get along, but before things escalated, they noted something out of place: a [[Frodo Baggins|strange small creature]], all wound up in [[Shelob]]'s webs. The discovery of what appeared to be an undersized [[Elves|Elf]] led the two commanders to compare their notes; they concluded that there must have been another nearby. But they could not find this "great Elf warrior". 

Turmoil rose again amongst the group when Gorbag and Shagrat disagreed with what they had to do with the prisoner. Shagrat's orders from [[Sauron|above]] were simple; all personal effects were to be sent to [[Barad-dûr]]. Shagrat did not trust many of his own troops, and none of Gorbag's, so he locked up the prisoner in the top chamber of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{TT|IV10}}</ref>

Gorbag coveted the ''[[Mithril]]'' shirt Frodo wore, and attempted to usurp Shagrat's rule. Though he was larger than his adversary, Gorbag lost to Shagrat's superior numbers. Soon, Gorbag's faction was pressed back. Shagrat eventually killed [[Gorbag]], and ran off to Sauron with the prisoner's belongings.<ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref> He did not reach Barad-dûr until four days later; Sauron killed him after he delivered the news of intruders.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 609</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''[[1981]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Chris Fairbank]] played Shagrat.  He is overheard by Sam discussing [[Shelob]] with [[Gorbag]], and then Sam encounters him again on the stairs in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

'''[[1989]]: [[Crack of Doom Software Adventure|''Crack of Doom'' Software Adventure''']]
:Shagrat is simply referred to in-game as a "large angry Orc". He is carrying a long red knife and a black bundle. He can be killed by Sam.

'''[[2003]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:[[Peter Tait]] played Shagrat. In this adaptation, it is Shagrat and not Gorbag who covets the ''[[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|mithril]]'' shirt and starts the fight. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], he is shown escaping with the ''mithril'' shirt, which is then presented later by the [[Mouth of Sauron]] to the Captains of the West. It is unclear if this means Shagrat had changed his mind and brought the shirt to [[Barad-dûr]], or if he was waylaid by Orcs loyal to Sauron during his escape, and the shirt was confiscated.
