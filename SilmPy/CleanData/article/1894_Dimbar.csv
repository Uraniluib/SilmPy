'''Dimbar''' was an empty land in [[Beleriand]].
==Geography==
Dimbar formed a wedge between the [[Sirion]] and the [[Brethil|Forest of Brethil]] in the west and the [[Mindeb]] and [[Neldoreth]] in the east (and [[Nan Dungortheb]] in the northeast). The main road, which crossed the Sirion at the [[Ford of Brithiach]] to [[Himring]], cut Dimbar in half; to the north of the road the land climbed to the vales of the [[Crissaegrim]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

No settlements or inhabitants were mentioned in Dimbar.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Dimbar"</ref>
==History==
During a battle with [[orcs]], [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]], at a very young age, became lost and desperate in a mist in Dimbar. They were found by [[Thorondor]], and would be the first mortals to see [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

After then [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Orcs]] from [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] built a road through [[Anach]] and the land was overrun by Orcs. [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] and [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] would lead raids against them.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

After [[Morgoth]] had freed [[Húrin]] he came to the land of Dimbar. There he stood before the silent cliffs of the [[Echoriath]] and cried out for [[Turgon]] to hear him. But Húrin had been followed and was heard, and his words told Morgoth where Turgon dwelt.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
==Etymology==
''Dimbar'' is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[dim]]'' "sad" and ''[[-mbar]]'' "dwellingplace, home".
