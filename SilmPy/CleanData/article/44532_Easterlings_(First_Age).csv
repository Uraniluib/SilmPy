The '''Easterlings''' also known as '''Swarthy Men''', were primitive tribes of [[Men]] who roamed [[Middle-earth]] in the [[First Age]]. 
==History==
Long after the [[Men]] awoke in [[Hildórien]], some of them left that land to migrate to the [[Beleriand|West]]. Some of the ancestors of the Swarthy Men left their descendants in [[Eriador]]. Of those people came the indigenous Men that dwelt in the north in the later [[Ages]].<ref name=GA>{{WJ|P1}}</ref>

They made their way to [[Beleriand]]; others desired its rich lands, while others were instigated by the Enemy. They entered from east of [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]] after [[Dagor Bragollach]], much later than the [[Edain]] who had already established themselves among the [[Noldor]] and the [[Sindar]]. 

Some of them, like [[Bór]], entered the service of the [[House of Feanor]] and fought with [[Maedhros]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Others, like [[Ulfang the Black|Ulfang]] and his sons, were for a part secretly in league with [[Morgoth]] and betrayed [[Caranthir]] resulting in the defeat. 

The Easterlings were betrayed by their lord Morgoth, and confined to [[Hithlum]] in the latter years of the First Age. Those [[Incomers]] enslaved the remaining Edain. Some, like [[Brodda]], intermarried with the Edain. 

After the [[War of Wrath]], those that survived fled back over the Ered Luin to [[Eriador]] and beyond.<ref group="note">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] suggests that the Easterlings of the First Age were related to the Easterlings of the [[Third Age]]; during the deluge of Beleriand they fled to [[Rhûn]] and were the ancestors of the Easterlings as they appear in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; cf. {{HM|AME}}, p. 40-41. [[Andreas Moehn]] suggests instead that they were ancestors to, or related to the [[Haradrim]], also called "Swarthy Men". cf. [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Men_of_Darkness.html The Men of Darkess]</ref> Some of them became Kings of the primitive [[Middle Men]] who had no contact with the [[Eldar]] or the [[Edain]]. For this the Middle Men were neglected by the Valar.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
===Sons of Bór===
[[Bór]] was a leader of Men who came into Lothlann, Beleriand, in the year {{FA|463}}. His people were worty, and tillers of the earth.<ref name=GA/>

His sons were [[Borlach]], [[Borlad]] and [[Borthand]]. Bór was welcomed by [[Maedhros]], who gave him and his followers land north of the [[March of Maedhros]], and south of it. Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros, and remained faithful, though he was told by Morgoth to betray the banner of [[Caranthir]]. All of them were wiped out during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].

===Sons of Ulfang "the Accursed"===
[[Ulfang]] also came in Lothlann, Beleriand, in 463, shortly after Bór. He was the father of [[Ulfast]], [[Ulwarth]], and [[Uldor]]. Ulfang was welcomed by the sons of [[Fëanor]], and he and his sons swore allegiance to Caranthir. They were given lands to dwell in the north and south of the March of Maedhros. Ulfang and his sons were secretly in the employ of Morgoth, and [[Treachery of Men|betrayed]] the [[Eldar]] and Edain during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

==Traits and culture==
They are described as short and broad, with swarthy (dark) skin, eyes and hair. Some had greater liking for the [[Dwarves]] of the mountains than for the [[Elves]].<ref name=s18>{{S|18}}</ref> Some of their women were proud and barbaric.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

It is seen that they were used to alliterate the names of father and sons/brothers, a custom also seen among the [[House of Beor]].<ref>{{webcite|website=Lalaith|articlename=The Men of Darkness|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Men_of_Darkness.html}}</ref><ref group="note">Other than the name alliteration, a Germanic custom, Andreas Moehn also notes that their names have a strong Germanic flavor.</ref>
