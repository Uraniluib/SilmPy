The '''Starkhorn''' was one of the largest of the [[White Mountains]]. It was a snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the mountain range. From its feet sprang the [[Snowbourn]], whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of [[Rohan]]. The [[Rohirrim]] called that valley [[Harrowdale]], and built their courts of [[Edoras]] at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley. On a cliff above the valley they found the refuge of [[Dunharrow]] which had been built by [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean Men]] of the White Mountains.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It means "horn standing up stiff like a spike" and represents [[Rohirric]].<ref name="Nomen"/>

As [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes, to an English reader ''stark'' now has implications of nakedness and grimness, not originally present in the word.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>
