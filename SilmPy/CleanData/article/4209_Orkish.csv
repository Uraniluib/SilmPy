'''Orkish''' was a general term for the jumble of languages used by the [[Orcs]], composed from corrupted borrowings from other languages of [[Middle-earth]]. The variations in Orkish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, and so a standard language was necessary. [[Sauron]] devised his [[Black Speech]] for this purpose in [[Mordor]], but in practice the [[Westron|Common Tongue]] was more normally used.<ref>{{App|Other}}</ref>
