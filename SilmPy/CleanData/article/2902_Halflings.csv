'''Halflings''' was a name for [[Hobbits]] used by [[Men]]; it was originally given to them by the tall [[Dúnedain]] who had stood two [[Ranga|rangar]] tall, making the average Hobbit about half their height. The term first applied to the [[Harfoots]] who became known in [[Arnor]] around {{TA|1050}} and later to the [[Fallohides]] and the [[Stoors]].<ref name=linear>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>

The name was used by [[Gondorians]] in the [[Third Age]], which they learned from their [[Dúnedain of Arnor|northern cousins]] although they knew them only by name; they never had seen a halfling, until [[Peregrin Took]] became the first who visited [[Minas Tirith]]. By the [[War of the Ring]] however, the Gondorians were shorter than their ancestors since the line of the Kings ended, and the halflings were more than half of their height.<ref name=linear/>
==Etymology==
The name "Halfling" is a translation from the [[Westron]] ''[[banakil]]'' which means "half-man". It was translated into both [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] as '''[[Perian]]'''.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>
