==Summary==
Tolkien called himself a man of limited sympathies and said that Charles Williams lay almost completely outside of them.  They were in close contact from late 1939 to Williamsâ€™ death and Tolkien had been an "assistant mid-wife" for ''[[All Hallows Eve]]'', although it was greatly changed due to [[C.S. Lewis]].  Tolkien enjoyed Williams' company but their minds were poles apart.  Tolkien actively disliked Williams' Arthurian-Byzantine mythology and blamed him for spoiling the end of Lewis' trilogy.

Tolkien said a proposed blurb for ''Tree and Leaf'' juxtaposed two things that only touched at a corner, for which he was not responsible since it came up at a time of distractions for him.  For some time he had thought of reprinting together ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'', ''[[On Fairy-Stories|On Fairy-stories]]'', and ''[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth]]'' because they were about the "heroic" in fairy-stories, the fairy-story, and "heroism and chivalry", respectively.
