'''Joe Mandala''' (b. [[1972]]) is an American role playing gaming author and Tolkien essayist.

Having started with Middle-earth gaming sometime in the mid-1980s, Mandala was involved by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] in the early 1990s to do secondary editing and vetting for [[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP, 2nd edition]]. He was selected to write the supplement Races and Cultures of Middle-earth for MERP/[[Rolemaster|RMSS]] (however, ICE lost the license to Middle-earth before project completion, and the supplement was never published). He also edited and researched articles published in ''[[Other Hands]]'', a gaming magazine devoted to MERP.

In the early 2000s, Mandala was hired by [[Decipher]] to gather source material for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]''. He also wrote the supplement ''[[Maps of Middle-earth: Cities and Strongholds]]''.

As of 2010, Mandala is editor for articles related to Middle-earth on ''[http://www.guildcompanion.com/ The Guild Companion]'', a monthly gaming web-magazine.

Joe Mandala studied Classical Antiquity at the [[wikipedia:University of Kansas |University of Kansas]] and lives in northeast [[wikipedia:Kansas |Kansas]] with his wife and four children. He is currently working with law enforcement agencies on criminal intelligence systems in a project management role.
