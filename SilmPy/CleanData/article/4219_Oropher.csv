}}'''Oropher''' was a [[Sindar]]in [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Doriath]]<ref name="Princes">{{UT|6b}}</ref>  who became the King of the [[Nandor|Silvan Elves]] of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] (which would later come to be called Mirkwood) during the [[Second Age]]. He was killed during the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and succeeded by his son, the Elvenking [[Thranduil]]. He was thus the grandfather of the only [[Elven]] member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], [[Legolas]]. 


==History==
Oropher was one of the [[Iathrim]] who spent his early life in [[Doriath]].<ref name="Princes">{{UT|6b}}</ref>  Following the destruction of [[Beleriand]] and the [[War of Wrath]], most of the [[Noldor]]in exiles and remnants of the Sindar retreated to [[Lindon]]. The [[Valar]] reinvited these Elves to [[Aman]], but Oropher, among many others, was unwilling and remained in Lindon.<ref name="Princes">{{UT|6b}}</ref> 

===Move to Greenwood the Great===
Some of the Sindar of Lindon, not wishing to stay with the dominant Noldor under [[Gil-galad]], chose to go east and live with the [[Nandor]] with whom they shared the same [[Teleri]]n ancestry.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Oropher with his people crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] and mingled with the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Silvan Elves]] of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. The Sindar adopted the language and wholly embraced the life of the Silvan Elves.<ref name="Princes" /> 
 
The Silvan Elves, who originally lived in the south of Greenwood, accepted Oropher as their King, who ruled from his capital on [[Amon Lanc]]. Over the course of the [[Second Age]] they gradually moved north to live around the [[Emyn Duir]].<ref name="Princes" />

===War of the Last Alliance===
Despite the Silvan Elves' hostility towards the [[Dwarves]] and the Noldor - and their desire to stay away from the affairs of the rest of the world - Oropher could see the danger that [[Sauron]] posed, and that his defeat would bring about peace in [[Middle-earth]]. He thus joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], summoning a large army which joined with [[Amdír]]'s smaller force of [[Galadhrim|Lórien Elves]] to create a singular, great host of Silvan Elves.<ref name="Princes" />

The Silvan Elves were strong and brave, but despite having poor armour and weapons in comparison with the [[Noldor]], Amdír and Oropher were unwilling to submit to the supreme command of [[Gil-galad]] and as such they suffered heavy losses in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. In the very first assault upon [[Mordor]] Oropher and other brave and hasty Elves rushed forward before Gil-galad gave the signal to charge. Oropher himself was killed soon afterwards, whilst two-thirds of his army perished throughout the course of the war. Upon Sauron's defeat the remnants of the army returned to Greenwood under the command of his son, Thranduil.<ref name="Princes" />

==Etymology==
Oropher came from [[Doriath]] - indicating that the name could be [[Sindarin]] or [[Doriathrin]] dialect - but: 

{{blockquote|Oropher had come among them with only a handful of Sindar, and they were soon merged with the Silvan Elves, adopting their language and taking names of Silvan form and style. This they did deliberately;|{{UT|Galadriel}}}}

The name probably means 'tall beech-tree'<ref name="EOA">[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda The Encyclopedia of Arda], "[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/o/oropher.html Oropher]", dated 21 April 2003 (accessed [[13 January|January 13]], [[2011]])</ref> from '''oro''' meaning 'high' and '''fêr''' meaning 'beech'.<ref name="Thains">[http://www.tuckborough.net/ The Thain's Book], "[http://www.tuckborough.net/elves.html#Oropher Elves of Middle-earth#Oropher]" (accessed [[13 January|January 13]], [[2011]])</ref>
