'''Îbal''', the son of [[Ulbar]], lived on a farm in [[Emerië]] in [[Númenor]], not far from the [[White House]] of [[Erendis]].  In the summer of {{SA|880}} Îbal came to the house upon an errand and met [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]], who thought him a noisy thing.  His visit prompted Ancalimë to ask questions of [[Zamîn]], one of Princess [[Erendis]]' servants, which led the girl to ask her mother for the first time about her father.

In {{SA|882|n}} when Prince [[Aldarion]] returned from a voyage he came upon a homecoming party that Ulbar’s wife had arranged to welcome her returned husband.  When the Great Captain (as Aldarion was known) was spotted, Îbal eagerly asked him how old a man had to be to go to sea in a ship.  But Aldarion's mood was bitter at the contrast between this festival and the welcoming he had received, so he told the boy, "As old as the hills, and with no other hope in life."<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
