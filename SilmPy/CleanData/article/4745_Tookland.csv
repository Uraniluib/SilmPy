'''Tookland''' was a wide region of [[the Shire]]'s [[Westfarthing]] that was the historical province of the [[Took Family|Took clan]], and so of the hereditary [[Thain|Thains]] of the Shire. The Tookland lay to the south of the [[East Road]],<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> with its chief and central township at [[Tuckborough]] in the [[Green Hills]]. There, burrowed into the hillsides, was the famous and historic home of the Tooks, [[Great Smials]]. Somewhat to the west of Tuckborough lay the smaller of the Tookland's main settlements, [[Tookbank]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==History==
The [[Travellers]] passed from Tookland on their way to the [[Green Hill Country]]. 

During [[Sharkey]]'s occupation, the Tooks were fortified in their smials and didn't allow any [[ruffians]] to enter, having shot three for prowling and robbing. They became nastier and kept a close watch. Around the time of the [[Battle of Bywater]], [[Thain]] [[Paladin Took II]] raised all the country and commanded some troops to drive them  away to the south, and sent a messenger to [[Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>
