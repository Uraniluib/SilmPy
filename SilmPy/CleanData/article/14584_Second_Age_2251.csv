==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'', it said in 2251 "[[Tar-Atanamir]] takes the [[Sceptre of Númenor|Sceptre]]", however, Atanamir died in {{SA|2221}}.  The year 2221 is itself an emendation of 2251, and the former (2221) appears in the later tables, while the latter (2251) in the earlier tables: therefore 2251 (properly 2221) should have read "Death of Tar-Atanamir. [[Tar-Ancalimon]] takes the sceptre".<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Note 10</ref>
