<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
From I shore I have known for long 
I heard enchanting songs 

Meadow was dancing 
By the flute and the harp 
The water was silent and so calm 

I walked to the path across the sea 
I walked to the place ever unseen 
Into the fields and the streams 
Beyond the land of the dreams 

Brif moment it took 
Then faded away 
I followed their song 
Followed their way 
Last sight of the sun 
Until eventide 
Showed me the road 
Served me as guide 

I walked to the path across the sea 
I walked to the place ever unseen 
Passing the walls, passing the signs 
Opening hidden doors of my mind 

On the shore I have known for long 
I sang enchanting songs
