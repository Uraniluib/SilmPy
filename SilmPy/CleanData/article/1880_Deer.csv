'''Deer''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''[[Aras]]''<ref>{{CH|Names}}, ''Cabed-en-Aras'', p. 298</ref>) were graceful creatures found throughout [[Middle-earth]].  Deer were loved by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Nessa]], and were said to follow her as she travelled through wild lands.<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

In the [[First Age]] the [[Teiglin]] River flowed through a gorge west of the forest of [[Brethil]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  At the narrowest part of the gorge was ''[[Cabed-en-Aras]]'', "The Deer's Leap", where once a deer leaped across the river to escape a huntsman of [[Haleth]].<ref>{{CH|16}}, p. 230</ref>

In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were in the process of crossing the [[Enchanted River]] when a dark-coloured deer bowled into the Dwarves.  Although [[Thorin]] shot the hart with an arrow as it leaped there was no recovering the venison for the boat they were using floated away.  Worse, the commotion caused [[Bombur]] to fall into the water, which caused him to fall asleep for days after he was rescued.  Soon after, a [[white deer]] and her snowy fawns appeared on the path.  The dwarves shot arrows at them but none hit and the deer vanished.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>

In [[Sindarin]], the adjective ''ross'' was often used to describe the copper colour of red deer.<ref>{{VT|41a}}, p. 10</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Deer are found in many places of Middle-earth. They are typically not aggressive, but some will fight if the player threatens them. Weaker deer will run away when attacked.
