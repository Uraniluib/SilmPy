'''Andvír''' was the son of [[Andróg]] and both of them were outlaws in the band called the [[Gaurwaith]] that [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] joined and later led.  When [[Orcs]] attacked their hideout upon [[Amon Rûdh]] there were only three survivors: Túrin (captured by the Orcs), [[Beleg]] (whom Túrin accidentally killed after Beleg had rescued him), and Andvír.  Andvír joined other refugees that made their way to the Havens.  As a very old man he supplied the poet [[Dírhaval]] with the story of Túrin and the Gaurwaith, which filled in the gap in Túrin's history between his flight from [[Doriath]] and his arrival at [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}, p. 311</ref>
