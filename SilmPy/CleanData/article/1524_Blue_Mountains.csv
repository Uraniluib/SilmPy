The '''Blue Mountains''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] '''''Ered Luin'''''), also known as the '''''Ered Lindon''''', was the mountain range at the far west of [[Eriador]].

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In the early days of [[Arda]] after the fall of the [[Two Lamps]], the Blue Mountains were formed as the [[Valar]] widened the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and thrust [[Middle-earth]] eastward to protect [[Valinor]].<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref> The Blue Mountains lined up with the [[Grey Mountains (ancient)|Grey Mountains of the southlands]], forming the western wall of [[Arda]]. These two ranges lay parallel to the [[Orocarni|Red Mountains]] in the northeast and [[Yellow Mountains]] in the southeast that formed the eastern wall. At their northern end, a narrow gap separated the Blue Mountains from the [[Iron Mountains]], which stretched across the entire north of Middle-earth.<ref>{{SM|4a}}</ref>

Sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]] two [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Dwarven Fathers]] awoke under [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] and founded the two westernmost houses of the [[Dwarves]] (the [[Firebeards]] and [[Broadbeams]]). They subsequently built two great city-states, [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]].

In the [[First Age]], the Blue Mountains were an unbroken line separating Eriador from [[Beleriand]]. Seven rivers flowed from its western side, and the land these rivers flowed through was known as [[Ossiriand]]. Later, when the [[Green-elves]] settled there, the land was called [[Lindon]], and the mountains sometimes referred to as the ''Ered Lindon''.

The Blue Mountains were ruined during the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the First Age, and in the south central end of the range the sea broke through. The [[Lhûn|River Lhûn]] now flowed through the mountains to the [[Gulf of Lune]]. On the western side a small section of Lindon remained, and here the retreating [[Elves]] built the kingdom of [[Lindon]], ruled by [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], last [[High King of the Noldor]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

The Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost were also ruined when the mountains were broken, causing most of the Dwarves to migrate east to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], leaving a remnant behind. However, there remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

=== Third Age ===

By the Third Age, Dwarves dwelt in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially in the parts south of the [[Gulf of Lhun]] where they have mines that are still in use.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> 

In {{TA|1974}}, fleeing the fall of [[Fornost Erain]], [[Arvedui]] briefly hid in old dwarven mines in the far north of the Blue Mountains.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>
  
It also became the new home for many of [[Durin's Folk]] who were exiled from their halls in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] who had [[Sack of Erebor|driven them out]].  After the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] established his throne in the Southern range beyond [[the Shire]] and later his son [[Thorin]] ruled after he went missing. During Thorin's reign, many of the wandering Longbeards joined him in [[Thorin's Halls|his halls]] and they became prosperous in a fashion. However, Erebor was retaken from Smaug by Thorin and company in {{TA|2941}}, and it can be assumed most if not all of Durin's folk relocated there.{{Pronounce|Ered Luin.mp3|Ardamir}}

==Etymology==
''Ered Luin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, consisting of ''[[ered]]'' ("mountains") and ''[[luin]]'' ("blue").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 66</ref> Other names were '''Ered Lindon''' "Mountains of Lindon" and the [[Westron]] name '''Mountains of Lune'''.

The ''[[Etymologies]]'' show a [[Noldorin]] alternative name, '''Lhúndirien'''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 370</ref>

In [[Ælfwine]]'s [[Old English]] translations, the Blue Mountains are named ''Hǽwengebeorg''.<ref>{{SM|7An}}, p. 341</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:The Blue Mountains form the location of a fight between Dwarves and [[Drogoth]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Blue Mountains appear as the game's westernmost region, Ered Luin. Ered Luin is the beginner's region for the game's races, Elves and Dwarves. The region's storyline is based around a conflict with a rogue clan of Dwarves called the Dourhands and a tribe of Goblins living in the winding valleys of a region called Rath Teraig. Ered Luin is home to the cities of Thorin's Hall and Duillond, but also contain smaller outposts such as Gondamon and Celondim. Ered Luin is also home to the hostile Dourhand cities of Kheledul and the excavation of a long-lost city named Sarnur.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Although the Blue Mountains do not appear in the game, they are mentioned by the Dwarf [[Grof]]. He tells the player that the Blue Mountains are prosperous, but that they lately find more iron than gold.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>
