'''The Forbidden Pool''' is the sixth chapter of the fourth book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

===Summary===
[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] is awakened late in the night, as [[Faramir]] seeks advice on a matter. Frodo asks whether it is morning already, and Faramir tells him the dawn is just breaking, but that they must leave right away. Faramir takes the Hobbit to a cliff by the river, and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] joins them. For a while, Frodo wonders why he was roused from sleep to come watch the river. Sam, too, is curious. He remarks on the beauty of the landscape, but suggests it is not enough to justify getting up so early in the morning. Faramir says that the landscape is not the reason they have come. He tells Frodo to look down and identify a small, dark creature moving in the water. Frodo gazes down and recognizes [[Gollum]], who has followed them, unseen by Faramir’s men until now. Faramir asks what kind of a creature it is. His men inquire as to whether they should try to kill it or not. Frodo begs them not to do so.

Faramir asks whether Gollum knows about the treasure Frodo is carrying. Frodo replies that Gollum does know about it, and indeed carried it himself for some time. Now, Frodo explains, Gollum just wants fish to eat. Faramir’s guard reminds his lord that the punishment for anyone trespassing in their kingdom is death. Frodo offers to speak to Gollum instead. Frodo goes down to the water and addresses the creature, who pouts about having been abandoned and refuses to come. Finally, Frodo persuades Gollum to leave the water, leading him toward the area where Faramir’s men are waiting for him. The men apprehend Gollum, who feels betrayed by Frodo and spits on him as he is led away.

Faramir demands to interrogate Gollum, who initially refuses to cooperate. Frodo tries to persuade the creature to trust him. Faramir asks whether Gollum has ever been in this area before. Gollum claims he has not. Faramir does not believe Gollum, but he ultimately accepts the truthfulness of the creature’s statement. Frodo sticks with his assertion that Gollum should not be harmed, begging Faramir’s men not to hurt Gollum. Faramir agrees, on the condition that Gollum be considered Frodo’s servant.

However, Faramir privately warns Frodo to be wary of Gollum, whom he still does not trust. Faramir says that there is evil growing in Gollum, and that he is curious about how this “creeping thing” came into the possession of [[The One Ring|the Ring]] earlier. Faramir says that one day, when he and Frodo are old and chair-bound, Frodo can tell him the story. Faramir also warns against Frodo’s passing over the mountains, saying that there is great danger there. Frodo replies that this is the only way he can go, as he must avoid the gates of Mordor that they passed earlier. Faramir says it is a hopeless task.
