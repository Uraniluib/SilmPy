'''''The Tale of Gondolin''''' is an attempt by [[Alex Lewis]] to compile the unfinished tales of [[Turgon]] and [[Gondolin]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] into a single publication (in a manner similar to ''[[The Children of HÃºrin]]''). The story draws upon texts from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]: "[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]''", and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.

''The Tale of Gondolin'' was not backed by the [[Tolkien Estate]], although it is claimed that [[Priscilla Tolkien]] gave a verbal permission to Lewis to work with the project.<ref>[http://www.hobbit.ca/Gondolin-variations.html Hobbit.ca: "The Tale of Gondolin", as of April 14, 2010]</ref> 

The publication was limited to 50 copies worldwide and the suggested value for a single copy is well over $1,000.

==Editions==

===First Edition===
In [[1987]] two proof copies of the book were produced. One was red leather bound and given to [[Priscilla Tolkien]] and the other was clothbound for Lewis. Neither copies were signed or illustrated.

===First State===

In [[1992]], artist [[Ruth Lacon]] was commissioned to make illustrations for the book. She strived to create "a modern analogue to an illustrated and illuminated medieval manuscript."<ref>"A note from Ruth Lacon" in ADC Art & Books: catalogue 2009/10, p.30.</ref>

By the end of [[1995]], 28 out of the 50 copies had been sold though they were not sold in sequential order. The "Number One" was donated to Priscilla Tolkien. These 28 are known as the First State.

===Second State===

In late 2003 or early 2004 a US book collector found out from Alex Lewis that the remaining 22 copies had not been sold and were still unbound. He chose to buy the 22 copies and had them bound by another binder in Manchester as the original binder had unfortunately passed away. These 22 newly bound copies were finished in 2004 and are known as the Second State.
