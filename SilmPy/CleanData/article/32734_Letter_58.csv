==Summary==
Tolkien explained that he wrote an airgraph<ref group="note">An airgraph consisted of a letter photographed and delivered in small print that the addressee could read with a magnifying glass.</ref> but that it took days to send.  After a few details about wartime hardships he reported picking up the adventures of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] again, after having polished the chapter on the Orthanc-stone.<ref>{{TT|III11}}</ref>

Tolkien told a story about finding himself in a carriage with an R.A.F. officer and a very nice young American Officer.  When the Yank burbled about “Feudalism” and its results on English class distinctions and social behaviour Tolkien opened a broadside.  An Englishman’s relations with working men was as connect to "Feudalism" as skyscrapers had to wigwams.  Tolkien told the American that his "Oxford accent" was not "forced" but a middle-class invention.  After telling the American that his "accent" sounded like English wiped with a dirty sponge and that the American habit of slouching indicated a slovenly and ill-disciplined people they got along quite friendly.

A stroll around Tolkien's home town revealed only one piece of war wreckage but much more damage due to great flat featureless modern buildings.  If Christopher could imagine building better than most Oxford colleges replace by girls' council schools he would understand.  He had met with old school chums and found that he was chiefly remembered for rugger-prowess (!!) and his taste in coloured socks.
