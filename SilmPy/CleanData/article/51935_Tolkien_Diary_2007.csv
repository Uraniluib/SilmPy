==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The annual Tolkien diary, this year containing a haunting collection of watercolours and pencil sketches by acclaimed and Oscar-winning Tolkien artist, Alan Lee, from the newly published The Children of Hurn, J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic tale of adventure set in Middle-earth.<br/><br/>The Tolkien desk diary for 2007 continues in a popular tradition, building on the success of The Hobbit diary 2006.<br/><br/>This year’s diary features 13 paintings and illustrations by Alan Lee and is more sumptuous than ever. It is not only illustrated by the acclaimed and Oscar-winning Tolkien artist, it has been designed by him, too, with the same care and attention to detail that has seen his work embraced by the Tolkien Estate, Peter Jackson and discerning fans around the world.<br/><br/>To accompany each watercolour, every month features complementary line drawings selected by Alan from his Lord of the Rings Sketchbook; there are also brand new sketches produced exclusively for this diary.<br/><br/>Alan Lee has depicted famous scenes including Gollum and Bilbo, Rivendell and Smaug the Dragon, but these new pencil drawings will take the reader deeper into the enchanting world of Middle-earth than ever before.}}
