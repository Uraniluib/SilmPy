'''Valandil''' ({{SA|3430}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 192</ref> – {{TA|249}}<ref name="north">{{App|North}}</ref>) was the third [[Kings of Arnor|King of Arnor]], succeeding his father, [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] [[Isildur]], after he and Valandil's older brothers were killed in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] in {{TA|2}}. 

==History==
Valandil was the youngest of the four sons of Isildur. When his mother was still pregnant, the [[War of the Last Alliance]] was to begin, and Isildur sent her to [[Rivendell]] for safety.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> Valandil was born there<ref>{{App|North}}, note 1</ref>, in the same year that the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was formed.  He was only one year old, remaining with his mother in Rivendell, when the host of [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]] marched forth.<ref name="Elendil"/>

Before he was slain, Isildur became briefly king of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. While he had been High King of both realms, he committed the rule of Gondor to his nephew [[Meneldil]]<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> who would become [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]. With the death of his father and brothers in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], Valandil became heir to the throne of Arnor. However, since Valandil was only 13 years old, he would wait until he was 21 to become the king (in {{TA|10}}).<ref name="Elendil"/>

He ruled longer than any other king in the North or South kingdoms - 239 years. When he died in {{TA|249|n}}, he was succeeded by his son, [[Eldacar (King of Arnor)|Eldacar]].<ref name="north"/>

==Etymology==
Valandil's name is [[Quenya]] for "Friend of the Valar", from ''[[Valar|Vala]]'', and the suffix ''[[-ndil]]'', meaning "friend". It was likely he was named after his ancester [[Valandil (Lord of Andúnië)|Valandil]], the first [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].
