{{Pronounce|Angmar.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Angmar''' ('Iron Home', [[Sindarin]]) was a region and kingdom founded in [[Third Age]] 1300 in the far north of the [[Misty Mountains]] by the evil Lord of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], who became known as the "[[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]". Since the Witch-king was a vassal of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], it is presumed that Angmar's wars against the successor kingdoms of [[Arnor]] were done at Sauron's bidding.

The capital of Angmar was [[Carn Dûm]]. Here it was said that an evil race of men, possibly related to the Easterlings of the First Age, lived.

==History==

The realm of Angmar was founded in the lands north of the Ettenmoors and between the Mountains of Angmar and the Grey Mountains with the sole purpose of destroying the [[Dúnedain]] of the North.  The spirit of in the east conducted the [[Witch-King of Angmar]], the lord of the [[Nazgûl]] to gather evil men and creatures to destroy the fading [[Dúnedain]].  

Soon after Angmar was founded it waged war against the divided [[Dúnedain]] realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. [[Rhudaur]] was the first kingdom to fall.  Already in [[Rhudaur]] the [[Dúnedain]] were growing few, and an evil Hillman seized the kingship.  This chieftain allied with Angmar, and they exterminated the few remmaining Dúnedain in [[Rhudaur]].  

Now under the Witch-King's control, the forces of Rhudaur and Angmar invaded Arthedain, killing [[Argeleb I]] the king of Arthedain. However, with the aid of the armies of Cardolan, Arthedain managed to maintain a line of defence along the [[Weather Hills]].

In 1409 Angmar attacked [[Rivendell]] and Cardolan, besiegeing the Rivendell and destroying all of the Cardolan's settlements except its capital in the [[Barrow-downs]]. Since Rhudaur had fallen under Angmar's control, this left Arthedain without any allies except for [[Lindon]]. Despite this, Arthedain struggled on for another 500 years. The last people of Cardolan died in the [[Great Plague]], allowing Angmar to send [[Barrow-wights]] to infest the Barrow-downs. 

In 1974 Angmar amassed its forces and launched a final assault on Arthedain. Angmar took Arthedain's capital [[Fornost]], destroying the last kingdom of the Dúnedain.  The Witch-King hunted the King [[Arvedui]] into the north, where Arvedui was attempting to hold of the armies of Angmar.  When he was at the end of his resources, Arvedui fled to the bay of [[Forochel]].  The elves of Lindon sent a ship to rescue Arvedui, but it sunk in the bay of [[Forochel]], killing the last king of Arthedain. 

A year later, Prince [[Eärnur]] of [[Gondor]] arrived to aid Arthedain, but he was too late. His army utterly defeated the forces of Angmar in the [[Battle of Fornost]], but the Witch-king was not slain. He escaped and fled to [[Mordor]], but his kingdom of Angmar was no more.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

The territory of Angmar which extended east of the Misty Mountains was subsequently overrun by the [[Éothéod]], ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]].

== Etymology ==
Angmar means "Iron Home" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[ang]]'' = "iron" and ''[[-mbar|mar]]'' = "home, dwelling").{{Fact}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'':'''
:Angmar is a playable faction in the game, featuring mostly noncanon heroes and units. Moreover, in the campaign section of the game Angmar is besieged in [[Carn Dum]] by [[Glorfindel]] and his [[Elves]], however he wins the siege and destroys [[Arnor]] and [[Fornost]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''

:Angmar was not completely destroyed after the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Rather, the Witch-King changed [[Eärnur]] into a wraith to watch over his kingdom until it could rise once more. By the time of the War of the Ring the kingdom of Angmar was once again strong enough to threaten [[Eriador]]. The [[Men]] of Angmar were of two distinct cultures. The ruling class of [[Carn Dûm]] consisted of the sorcerous Angmarim, who had [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] blood and were staunch followers of [[Sauron]] and his servants. The others were the tribes of [[Hill-men]], native folk who continued their old traditions. One Hill-man clan, the Trév Gállorg, opposed the False King and was friendly to the [[Free peoples]]. Their rivals were the Angmarim-aligned Trév Duvárdain. Angmar is also home to many evil creatures such as [[wargs]], [[drakes]], [[spiders]], [[Vampires#Portrayal in adaptations|Merrevail]], and Gertheryg. Four tribes of [[orcs]], the Blogmal, the Krahjarn, the Ongbǘrz, and the Tarkrîp, originate from Angmar.

:The region was accessible from the [[North Downs]] by traveling through the Ram Dúath, a range of winding canyons in the south-west of Angmar. Within Ram Dúath were camps of the Angmarim and orcs marching to war, and also the peaceful Earth-kin village Lehmä-koti. North of the Ram Dúath were the grey hills of Fasach-Larran and Fasach-Falroid, where the Hill-men of Angmar dwelt. At the westernmost exit of the Ram Dúath was the Trév Gállorg village of Aughaire. The hostile Trév Duvárdain inhabited towns and camps in the north.

:To the east of the hills was the great brimstone swamp of Malenhad. The dread Watching-stones of the Rammas Deluon formed a barrier of deadly fear down the middle of Malenhad, effectively separating the western half of Angmar from the eastern half. The shallow sulfur lake Duvuinen lay in the east of Malenhad. Hidden in a cavern to the south of the lake was the Dwarf-outpost Gabilshathûr. In the south-east of Angmar beyond the lake were the valleys of Gorothlad, home to orcs, [[trolls]], and other evil creatures. Gorothlad contained several camps for Angmar's growing orc army as well as the arena of Maethad. North of Gorothlad was the rocky basin Nan Gurth, in the center of which stood Barad Gúlaran and its ring of eight lesser towers.

:West of Nan Gurth was Imlad Balchorth, a valley full of tombs and poisoned water, haunted by many [[wights]] and fell-spirits. In the north-east of Nan Gurth was Gath Uior, a pass to the Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu in the far north-east of Angmar near to the northernmost of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Deep underground within the Rift the [[Balrog]] Thaurlach was kept imprisoned after his defeat by the [[Blue Wizards]]. Fire-orcs and [[Nameless Things|Nameless creatures]] also dwelt there, though they were opposed by a mysterious race of fire [[giants]] known as the Eldgang.

:North-west of Nan Gurth and north-east of Imlad Balchorth was Himbar, an ashen, spider-infested land among crags of black rock like obsidian. Up a path into the rock walls that bordered Himbar in the east was the secret [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] refuge of Gath Forthnír. In the west of Himbar was the Angmarim town Rhunendin, and beyond that was a long gated pass to the capital city of [[Carn Dûm]]. In the south-west of the capital was a narrow, winding pass, guarded by Watching-stones, that connected to the hill-man towns in the north of Fasach-Falroid. The host of Angmar marched to the southern lands along a main road that led south from Rhunendin between Imlad Balchorth and Nan Gurth, then turned west to pass north of Malenhad. Beyond Malenhad the road turned south to enter the Ram Dǘath.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Angmar and [[Angmar War|its war with Arnor]] are mentioned by Galadriel in the [[White Council]]. Following the destruction of Angmar the Men of the North took the body of the Witch-King and sealed him in [[High Fells of Rhudaur]]. 

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:[[Gandalf]] tells [[Thranduil]] and [[Bard]] that [[Sauron]]'s final goal was to conquer the [[Lonely Mountain]] due to its strategic position. This would enable Sauron to restore Angmar and gain dominance over the north of [[Middle-earth]].
