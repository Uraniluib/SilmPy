'''Bardings''' were the [[Men of Dale|people]] of [[Dale]] during the later [[Third Age]].<ref name=meet>{{FR|II1}}</ref> They took their name from [[Bard]] the Bowman, a [[Men|Man]] descended from [[Girion]], who had been Lord of [[Dale]] when [[Smaug]] devastated it. 
==History==
The people of the Bardings belonged to that wide-ranging branch of [[Men]] known as the [[Northmen]], and were thus kin to both the [[Beornings]] and the [[Rohirrim]].<Ref>{{TT|RiderS}}</ref> 

After [[Bard]]'s revenge on the Dragon in {{TA|2941}}, he became [[King of Dale]] in his own right. He was succeeded as its ruler by his son [[Bain]], and so his line extended down to the time of the [[War of the Ring]] and beyond.

The Bardings maintained the friendship with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]], as their ancestors. As time passed, so the lands under the power of the Bardings grew, and in the time of [[Bard]]'s grandson [[Brand]] their territories were said to extend far to the south and east of the [[Long Lake]].<ref name=meet/> 

During the War of the Ring, the [[Easterlings]] [[Battle of Dale|attacked]] the city of Dale and forced the Men and the Dwarves into [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]; King Brand died alongside [[DÃ¡in Ironfoot]] at the [[Front Gate]] of Erebor. After seven days of siege, news came of the defeat of [[Sauron]]. The new kings broke the siege and chased the Easterlings out of Dale. After the siege, the two peoples rebuilt Dale. The new King [[Bard II]] also sent an emissary to the coronation of King Elessar.<ref>{{App|B}}</ref>
