'''Deephallow''' was a village on [[the Shire]]'s eastern border, built on the banks of the River [[Brandywine]], just north to the point where [[Shirebourn]] flowed into the river. Immediately across Brandywine was [[Haysend]], the southernmost point of [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[David Salo]] suggested that the name represents a speculative [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Deophealh'' "deep [[Wiktionary:haugh|haugh]]". A haugh meant first "angle, corner, secluded place" and later "land by a river", consistent to the location of the village near the wedge formed by Brandywine and Shirebourn.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
