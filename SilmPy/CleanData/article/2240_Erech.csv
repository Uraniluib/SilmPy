'''Erech''' was a hill in [[Gondor]] situated in the far north of the province of [[Lamedon]] at the mouth of the [[Blackroot Vale]], far to the west of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> It lay near to the southern entrance to the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Upon the summit stood a smooth black globe, the '''Stone of Erech'''.

==History==
In the [[Second Age]], [[Isildur]] brought with him the stone as a symbol of his lineage. The Stone of Erech was a great black stone, spherical in shape and roughly six feet in diameter. He set it upon the hill of Erech and made the local hill tribes swear an oath of loyalty on the stone. It was there that the [[King of the Dead]] swore allegiance to Isildur's cause at the time of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. Because he failed to fulfil his oath, the [[Oathbreakers]] haunted the hills until they made good their promise.

The Stone became a mysterious and eerie place, shunned by the people of the valley, who claimed it had fallen from the sky, and was haunted by restless spirits. The area was completely abandoned by the end of the [[Third Age]]. During the time of King [[Arvedui]] of [[Arthedain]], a prophecy was made regarding the arising of the dead during the [[War of the Ring]]. In this prophecy the Stone of Erech was mentioned:

When the [[Grey Company]] came to [[Rohan]], the sons of [[Elrond]] brought with them a reminder of these words from their father to [[Aragorn]], who acted upon these words to brave the Paths of the Dead.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|V2}}</ref>

After waiting through the long years of the Third Age, at midnight on [[8 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> the heir of Isildur, [[Aragorn]], came to Erech to hold the Dead to their oath again, promising that upon its fulfillment they would have peace.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|V2}}</ref> On [[13 March]],<ref name="Great"/> they held true to their oath and formed the Host of the Dead to help Aragorn defeat the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] at [[Pelargir]]. After the battle at Pelargir, Aragorn released them from their oath and they were allowed to rest.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Erech'', like so many names in Gondor, was of unknown [[Mannish]] [[pre-Númenórean]] origin.<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>
