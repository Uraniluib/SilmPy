'''Angbor the Fearless''' was the Lord of [[Lamedon]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]].

== History ==
On [[11 March]], {{TA|3019}}, Angbor led the men of Lamedon in a fight against invaders from [[Umbar]] and [[Harad]] who sought to capture [[Linhir]] and the fords of the River [[Gilrain]].  However, the battle halted and all the men of both sides fled upon the arrival of [[Aragorn]] with the [[Oathbreakers|Army of the Dead]] - all save Angbor who alone had the heart to face them.  Aragorn bade Angbor to gather his folk and follow him to [[Pelargir]] where "the Heir of [[Isildur]] will have need of you."

As Aragorn pressed on to Pelargir, Angbor mustered as many horsemen as he could, helped by the fast-spreading rumour of the return of the Heir of Isildur.  His force arrived at the riverside city on [[13 March]] after the Shadow Host had cleared the ships.  Afterwards, as Aragorn, [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], the [[Grey Company]], and the freed men of [[Gondor]] rowed north upon the [[Anduin]], Angbor led his horsemen north by land.

In the debate on [[16 March]] before the march to the [[Morannon]], [[Imrahil]] expressed concern for the defense of Gondor.  Aragorn assured him that new strength was on the way, stating that Angbor, whom he named "the fearless", was marching with 4,000 men through [[Lossarnach]].  Angbor's strength would be nearing [[Minas Tirith]] as Aragorn departed, thus leaving the city with a better defense than when the assault began.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
'''Angbor''' means "Iron Fist", from ''[[ang]]'' = "iron" and ''[[paur]]'' = "fist, hand".
