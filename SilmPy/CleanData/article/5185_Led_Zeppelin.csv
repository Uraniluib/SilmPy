'''Led Zeppelin''' was an English rock band active between [[1968]] and [[1980]], consisting of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. Many fans believe that lyrics to several Led Zeppelin songs were inspired from [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works whilst noting that one of Robert Plant's dogs was named [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].

==Songs with alleged Tolkien influence==
"'''Misty Mountain Hop'''"
:The lyrics mention an encounter with the police after getting stoned in the park, and leaving to go to the [[Misty Mountains]] ("where the spirits fly").

"'''Over the Hills and Far Away'''"
:Believed to describe ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s discovery of the [[One Ring]].

"'''The Battle of Evermore'''"
:Mentions the [[Ringwraiths]]. It also mentions the "Prince of Peace", a messianic-like figure who could be [[Frodo]] or [[Aragorn]], who "embraced the gloom" and "walked the night alone". Also a "Queen of Light" is mentioned, alluding to [[Galadriel]].

"'''Ramble On'''"
:Mentions [[Gollum]] and [[Mordor]],

"Stairway to Heaven" has also been misinterpreted<ref>{{webcite|articlename=Exclusions|articleurl=http://www.tolkien-music.com/exclusions.html|website=TM|accessed=12 October 2012}}</ref> to have Tolkienian references such as the line "''There's a feeling I get when I look to the [[Uttermost West|West]] And my spirit is crying for leaving''".
