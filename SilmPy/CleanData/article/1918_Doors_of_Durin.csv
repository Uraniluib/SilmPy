The '''Doors of Durin''', also known as the '''West-gate''', the '''West-door of Moria''', or '''Elven Door''', were built into the [[Walls of Moria]] in the dark cliffs of the [[Celebdil|Silvertine]], and formed the western entrance to the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

==History==
The main entrance to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] was the [[Great Gates]] in [[Dimrill Dale]], east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. During the [[Second Age]], it was decided to open a way to the west side of the Silvertine, which would facilitate contact and cooperation with the [[Elves|Elven]] realm of [[Hollin]].<ref name="Dark">{{FR|II4}}</ref>

The '''Elven Door''' was constructed in cooperation between Dwarves and Elves, sometime between {{SA|750}} and {{SA|1500|n}}.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> It was the two greatest craftsmen of the Second Age, the [[Noldor|Elf]] and Lord of Eregion, [[Celebrimbor]], and the [[Dwarves|dwarf]] [[Narvi]] who built the Doors.<ref name="Dark"/>
These were the days before the [[Dark Years]] of [[Sauron]]'s dominion in [[Middle-earth]], and the friendship between Elven and Dwarven kingdoms was a rare and special event. During this peaceful time the Doors stood open, allowing unfettered trade. But during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] (in {{SA|1697}}) the Doors were sealed shut after [[Sack of Eregion|Hollin fell]] to Sauron's forces.<ref name="SA"/>

When Khazad-dûm was abandoned in {{TA|1981}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the way of opening the Doors was forgotten.

At some point between {{TA|2845|n}} and {{TA|2950|n}} the Wizard [[Gandalf]] entered the city looking for King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] who had disappeared on journey to Erebor. After his search the Wizard exited through the Doors; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.<ref name="Dark"/>

In {{TA|2994|n}}, during the settling of [[Balin's Colony]], they were attacked by an onslaught of [[orcs]].<ref name="TA"/> [[Óin]] led a group to the west side of the city hoping to find escape through the Doors of Durin, but instead he found the water up to the doors where the [[Watcher in the Water]] killed him. The Dwarves were trapped, and wiped out.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>

In [[August]] {{TA|3018|n}} [[Gollum]] took refuge in Moria; but when he had at last discovered the way to the Doors he could not get out.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>

On [[13 January]] {{TA|3019|n}} the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] entered Moria through the Doors,<ref name="Great"/> but initially Gandalf could not find out the password to open them. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] unknowingly gave Gandalf the answer by asking, "What does it mean by ''speak, friend, and enter''?" When Gandalf realized that the correct translation was "Say friend and enter" he sprang up, laughed, and said "''[[Mellon]]''", which means "friend" in [[Sindarin]], and the Doors opened. Shortly thereafter, the [[Watcher in the Water]] attacked the Fellowship and shut the Doors behind them.<ref name="Dark"/>

==Appearance==
[[Image:J.R.R._Tolkien_-_Doors_of_Durin.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''The Doors of Durin'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (as printed in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Ch. 4 - [[A Journey in the Dark]]).]]

They were fashioned as flush doors, the jambs invisible to the eye, and matched so perfectly with the mountain rock that when closed the Doors could not be seen. The slabs were made by Narvi out of a grey material stronger than stone, and inlaid by Celebrimbor with ''[[ithildin]]'', which could only be seen in starlight and moonlight.

When visible, the fine silver-like inlay showed a hammer and anvil (the emblems of [[Durin]]), a crown and [[Seven Stars]] (probably [[Durin's Crown]]), two trees surmounted by crescent moons (probably symbolizing the [[Galathilion|Tree of the High Elves]]), and a single star (the emblem of the [[House of Fëanor]]). On the top left and right corners there were the [[tengwar]] ''[[Calma]]'' (C) and ''[[Óre]]'' (N) standing for Celebrimbor and Narvi; between their feet was an ''[[Ando]]'' (D) for Durin.

The inscription on the [[Wikipedia:Archivolt|archivolt]] read:
<blockquote>''"Ennyn Durin Aran Moria. Pedo Mellon a Minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin."''</blockquote>

As Gandalf first translated it to the other Walkers:
<blockquote>"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."</blockquote>

Actually, the inscription gave the password that would cause the Doors to swing open. Gandalf's translation is correct, but the proper translation of the second sentence, also correct, is "Say 'friend' and enter."<ref name="Dark"/>

From the inside the Doors could be opened by simply pushing against them, though it usually took the thrust of two to do so. When Moria was inhabited by the Dwarves they kept doorwards inside who would help open the Doors and see that only those with permission could pass.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, Note 12</ref>

==An Inconsistency==
The name ''[[Moria]]'' means "Black Chasm" and was a derogatory description of the place which the Dwarves did not like, and was given ''after'' [[Durin's Bane]] took over the city in the [[Third Age]]. It is therefore a mystery why that name appears on an inscription made in the Second Age, and made in consent with the Dwarves.
