'''Lofar''' was one of the four Dwarves that stayed at [[Bag End]] after [[Bilbo Baggins]]' birthday party.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>
==Other versions==
In the early writings of the chapter "[[A Long-expected Party]]", Lofar was given some dialogue and a bit more development. However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.{{fact}}

==Etymology==
''Lofarr'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It can mean either "Stooper" or "Praiser".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
