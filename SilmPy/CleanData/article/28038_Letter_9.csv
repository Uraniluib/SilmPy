==Summary==
This letter was titled "''Maps &c. for The Hobbit''". Miss Dagnall, an Oxford graduate, had read an unfinished typescript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and recommended Tolkien offer it for publication (accounts of this are given in Letters [[Letter 163|163]], [[Letter 257|257]] and [[Letter 294|294]]). In this letter the book had been accepted and Tolkien sent redrawn versions of the maps and illustrations to be included in the published volume.  He apologised for his "small skill and no experience of preparing such things", but nevertheless hoped they can be included.
