==Summary==
Disagreeing with George Bailey,<ref group="note">A former pupil of Lewis, Bailey had written an article about him for ''The Reporter''.</ref> Tolkien told Anne Barrett that [[C.S. Lewis]] had some oddities and could be irritating (after all, he was an Irishman of Ulster).  However, he was not a professional clown but a natural one, when a clown at all.  Tolkien called him generous-minded and, except for some too deep-rooted for him to see, free of and on guard against prejudice.  His literary opinions had not been driven by envy.

Tolkien wished that after a great man died little men could be forbidden to scribble about him, those with insufficient knowledge to give them any key to the truth.  Lewis had not been "cut to the quick" when not elected as the professor of poetry.  At the tavern thereafter he was quite at ease, only distressed that his friends looked so glum.  He had not "readily accepted" the chair in [[Cambridge]].  He had not applied when it was advertised, and Cambridge used a lot of diplomacy to finally get him.  It had been a good move that had given him much happiness.
