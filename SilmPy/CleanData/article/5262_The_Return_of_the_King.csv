The Return of the King, being the third and final part of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy - The Lord of the Rings - which came out on October 20, 1955. The story begins as Pippin is in [[Rohan]], reunited with the remnants of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He steals Saruman's ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' and sees that [[Sauron]] will attack [[Minas Tirith]]. Then [[Gandalf]] delivers news to the steward of Gondor that war is imminent. Gandalf brings [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] with him, who enters the service of the steward. [[Aragorn]] by his courage and leadership proves himself a worthy ruler of men. He is destined to find a lost army of men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the paths of the dead. The remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of Gondor's capital city, [[Minas Tirith]], resulting in the cataclysmic [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  Those characters that manage to survive the battle are led by [[Aragorn]] on a assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the Black Gates of Mordor, partly to distract Sauron from defending his other borders so that Frodo and Sam can gain a clear passage into Mordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon exchanging idle words with the Mouth of Sauron.

==Book VI==

In the meanwhile, the brave and loyal [[Samwise Gamgee]] (who for a short time has himself become the ring-bearer) enables the long-suffering [[Frodo Baggins]] to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way they are captured by a company of orcs and must pretend to be orcs before they are able to escape. The company, tired and half-alive, finally reach the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]], where [[the One Ring]] is destroyed along with [[Gollum]], freeing [[Middle-earth]] from [[Sauron]]'s power forever. This happens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather than destroy it, and is attacked by Gollum who bites off Frodo's finger to take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the ring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant eagles who Gandalf rides to Mount Doom, from the black gates of Morannon. After Sauron is defeated, his armies at the black gates flee, and the men of Gondor and Rohan are victorious in the battle.

Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor at Minas Tirith. After a series of goodbyes, the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]s return home, only to find [[the Shire]] under the control of 'sharky' who they find out is [[Saruman]], diminished in power but not in malevolence. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], now experienced warriors of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] respectively, take the lead in setting things right again, and lead an uprising of hobbits against Saruman, freeing the shire. Time passes. The Shire heals, but Frodo does not. Eventually Frodo departs for the [[Undying Lands]] to find healing, along with [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]] and the [[Elves]]. [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], Merry and Pippin watch them depart and return home in silence. Sam is greeted by his wife Rose and his daughter Elanor. The last line of the book Sam says to Rose; "Well, I'm back".

==Title==

Tolkien conceived of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a single volume comprising six sections he called "books" and extensive appendices. The original publisher made the decision to split the work into three parts, publishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices under the title ''The Return of the King'', in reference to [[Aragorn]]'s assumption of the throne. Tolkien indicated he would have preferred ''The War of the Ring'' as a title, as it gave away less of the story; but he was overruled by his publishers.

==Structure==

The structure of ''The Return of the King'' mirrors somewhat that of ''The Two Towers'' in that the first section recounts the various adventures of several characters including a massive battle, and the second section resumes the quest of the [[Ring-bearers]].

* Book VI: The End of the Third Age
