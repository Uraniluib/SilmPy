'''Ann-Sophie Qvarnström''' ([[1958]]-), Swedish silversmith and illustrator, created several maps of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] in the 1980s for ''Sagan om Ringen: Rollspelet'' (the Swedish version of ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]]''). The maps were made using gouache paint and were designed after the original MERP maps created by [[Pete Fenlon]].
