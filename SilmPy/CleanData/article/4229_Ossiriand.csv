'''Ossiriand''' was a region of eastern [[Beleriand]] bounded by the River [[Gelion]] on the west, the River [[Ascar]] on the north, the [[Ered Luin]] on the east, and the River [[Adurant]] on the south.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  It was a wooded region with many elm trees.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[Elder Days]], a green, forested and little peopled region in easternmost [[Beleriand]]<ref group=note>While Tolkien stated that Ossiriand was a part of Beleriand, he wrote in a manuscript that it "''was regarded as a separate country''". ({{PE|18}}, p. 79)</ref> at the western feet of the Blue Mountains was named ''Ossiriand'' ("Land of Seven Rivers") by the [[Sindar]].<ref name=WJC>{{WJ|C}}, p. 385</ref><ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 195</ref><ref name=GA1350>{{GA|1350}}, p. 13</ref>

In the early [[First Age]] before the rise of the [[Moon]],<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 164 (§29)</ref> a part of the [[Teleri]]n [[Elves|Elven]] people called [[Nandor]] entered Ossiriand under their leader [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]], and were given permission by [[Thingol]] to settle the lands.<ref name=GA1350/><ref>{{MR|P2j}}, p. 93 (§86)</ref> These Nandor became known as the [[Green-elves]].

After their leader Denethor was killed in an [[Orcs|Orc]]-raid, the Green-elves chose no more leaders, and many of them removed to [[Doriath]].<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 263 (§114)</ref><ref>{{S|10}}</ref>

In the following centuries of the [[First Age]], Ossiriand suffered little from the [[Battles of Beleriand]]. After the return of [[Beren]] and [[Luthien]] from the dead, they stayed in [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]] on [[Tol Galen]]. After the death of [[Thingol]], [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] tried to return home with the treasure of [[Menegroth]]; but they were waylaid by Beren, leading an army of [[Laiquendi]] and [[Ents]]. The Dwarves were all slain, and the treasure was cast into the River [[Ascar]].

Ossiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the [[War of Wrath]], although it was split in half by the [[Gulf of Lune]]. For its later history see [[Lindon]].

==Geography==
The Land of Seven Rivers lay between the River [[Gelion]] and the [[Blue Mountains]]. It was so named because Gelion and its tributaries watered the lands.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 195</ref><ref name=GA1350>{{GA|1350}}, p. 13</ref> The Seven Rivers were, from north to south:<ref name=GA1350/>
#River ''[[Gelion]]''
#River ''[[Ascar]]'' or ''Rathlóriel''
#River ''[[Thalos]]''
#River ''[[Legolin]]''
#River ''[[Brilthor]]''
#River ''[[Duilwen]]''
#River ''[[Adurant]]'', with [[Tol Galen]]

North of Ossiriand lay the land of [[Thargelion]], and south of the river Adurant later lay [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]]. Along the northern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to [[Nogrod]].

==Names and Etymology==
''Ossiriand'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "the Land of Seven Rivers"<ref name=PE1781>{{PE|17}}, p. 81</ref> (alternatively "Land of Seven Streams"<ref>{{HM|SM}}, p. 116</ref>). 

*Etymology: ''[[otso]]'' + ''[[sîr]]'' + ''[[-ian(d)]]''<ref name=PE1781/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Early names used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] for this region were ''Ossiriande''<ref name="Lay">{{LB|C1}}</ref>, ''Assariad''<ref>{{SM|Q14}}</ref> and ''Ossiriath''<ref>{{SM|4f}}</ref>.

'''Ossiriand''' is one of the rejected names for all of [[Beleriand]] which J.R.R. Tolkien jotted down "on a page of rough working for the opening of the [[The Lay of Leithian|Lay]]" (of Leithian) when he was probably searching for a replacement of Broseliand, used so far.  All in all there were eight of these names: [[Golodhinand]], [[Noldórinan]], [[Geleriand]], [[Bladorinand]], [[Belaurien]], [[Arsiriand]], [[Lassiriand]], and '''Ossiriand'''.<ref name="Lay"/>
