'''Lossarnach''' was a region and fiefdom in southern [[Gondor]].
==History==
Known as the "Vale of flowers", it was a fertile region lying south of eastern end of the [[White Mountains]]. It was the region closest to [[Minas Tirith]],<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> which depended on the fruit cultivated in the orchards of Lossarnach. Residents of Minas Tirith were also known to make expeditions to the region to behold its renowned flowers and trees (which surely included the valley [[Imloth Melui]]).<ref name=VT42/>

At the end of the [[Third Age]], its lord was the old [[Forlong]] the Fat, who led two hundred men to the aid of Minas Tirith.<ref name="MT">{{RK|V1}}</ref> Forlong was killed in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]],<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> but many of his men survived and accompanied [[Aragorn]] Elessar on his way to the [[Black Gate]], even though most of them were farmers.

Lossarnach was populated by many refugees from [[Ithilien]] and [[Osgiliath]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], most women and children from Minas Tirith were sent there.<ref name="MT"/>

Famous people from the region included the wise-woman [[Ioreth]] who served in the [[Houses of Healing]] of Minas Tirith,<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref> and [[Morwen Steelsheen]], wife of King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Lossarnach'' is glossed as "flowery Arnach".<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 513-4 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref> While [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] seemed to be convinced that the second element, ''[[Arnach]]'', was a [[Pre-Númenórean]] word, the first element caused more problems: since ''[[loss]]'' means "snow" in [[Sindarin]] it is unclear why it "''was prefixed to Arnach''", although it likely derived from likeness between ''loss'' and Sindarin ''[[loth]]'' ("flower").<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 18</ref><ref name=RC/>

==Inspiration==

[[Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955)|Writing in a letter]] about an impending trip in [[1955]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] identified Lossarnach as [[Wikipedia:Assisi|Assisi]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 462</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Lossarnach was an area in the region of Eastern [[Gondor]]. It was across the river [[Erui]] from Upper [[Lebennin]] to the west and across the river [[Anduin]] from South [[Ithilien]] to the east. The [[Rammas Echor]] divided it from the [[Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]] to the north-east. Settlements in Lossarnach included the capital city of [[Arnach#Portayal in adaptations|Arnach]], [[Imloth Melui]], [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]], and "Ost Norhir", though the latter two have fallen to the [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-host. The emblem of Lossarnach was three red roses on a white field. Baranor, Captain of the Guard of Arnach, and the Lady Vanyalos, sister of [[Denethor]] and husband of [[Forlong]], were in charge of the land when Forlong went to [[Minas Tirith]].
