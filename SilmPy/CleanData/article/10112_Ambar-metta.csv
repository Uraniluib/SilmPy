'''Ambar-metta''' is the [[Quenya]] term that refers to [[the End]] of the World.

It is mostly known as was part of a line used by [[Elendil]] upon his arrival to [[Middle-earth]], declaring "Out of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the [[Arda|world]]". [[Aragorn|Elessar]] would later use this line at his [[Coronation of Elessar|coronation]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
==Etymology==
''Ambar-metta'', meaning "World's-end", is a composition of two [[Quenya]] words, ''[[ambar]]'', here "world", and ''[[metta]]'', "end".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 105</ref>
