The '''Witch-king of Angmar''' was the chief of the [[Nazgûl]], King of [[Angmar]] and [[Sauron]]’s great captain in his wars.  A [[Wraiths|wraith]], the Witch-king of Angmar was nearly indestructible, a terrifying warrior, and a cunning strategist.

==History==
Some time after Sauron seized the [[Rings of Power]] in the [[Sack of Eregion]], {{SA|1697}} he gave [[Nine Rings|nine of them]] to [[Men|Mannish]] kings, sorcerers and other warriors.<ref>{{S|Rings}}, p. 289</ref>  With the power of their rings, the Nine achieved glory and grew wealthy, but they eventually started hating life as they were slowly drawn under Sauron’s dominion. In the end, they all became the dreadful [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].

The one later known as the Witch-king was one of these, likely one of the unnamed three lords of [[Númenor]] to take the rings.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, p. 267, Ballantine Books p. 320</ref><ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]], p. 20</ref>  He first appeared in the histories as a Ringwraith in {{SA|2251}}.  Being the most powerful of the Nazgûl, he became their chief and the most feared servant of his master Sauron.

When [[Mordor]] fell in {{SA|3441}}, the Nazgûl vanished into the shadows and were not heard of again for a long time.<ref name="appendixB">{{App|B}}</ref>

===Early Power in Angmar===
More than a thousand years later, in c. {{TA|1050|n}} of the [[Third Age]], [[Sauron]] began to rebuild his power in [[Dol Guldur]].  In c. {{TA|1300|n}} his Nazgûl also reappeared and the Witch-king established his realm, [[Angmar]], in the north.<ref name="appendixB">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix B]]</ref>  His capital was [[Carn Dûm]], on the northernmost peak of the [[Misty Mountains]].  He summoned men, [[orcs]] and other creatures of evil inclination to his banner.  No one knew that he was actually a servant of the long-dormant [[Sauron]] and few that he was a wraith.<ref name="AppA">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), [[Houghton Mifflin]] p. 320 </ref>

In the north, disunity plagued the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Arnor]]. They had divided into three kingdoms: [[Cardolan]], [[Rhudaur]] and [[Arthedain]], and were constantly at war with one another.<ref name="AppA">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), Houghton Mifflin p. 320 </ref>  The Witch-king saw the North-kingdom of Arnor as more vulnerable than the South-kingdom of Gondor.<ref name="Malvegil">[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]], [[The Heirs of Elendil]], entry for [[Malvegil]], [[HarperCollins]] p. 193-194 </ref>  He played upon their opposition, sending in infiltrators and taking over the hearts of the men of that land.  By {{TA|1349|n}}, the government of Rhudaur was controlled by men secretly in his service,<ref name="Malvegil">[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]], [[The Heirs of Elendil]], entry for [[Malvegil]], [[HarperCollins]] p. 193-194</ref> and he secretly aided them in their wars against the other kingdoms.<ref name="Argeleb">[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]], [[The Heirs of Elendil]], entry for [[Argeleb I]], [[HarperCollins]] p. 194</ref>  He then struck at a time of great hostility among the three, in {{TA|1409|n}}.  Rhudaur in the east fell first, and most of the Dúnedain there were hunted down and slaughtered by sorcerers.<ref name="Arveleg">[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]], [[The Heirs of Elendil]], entry for [[Arveleg I]], [[HarperCollins]] p. 194 </ref>  Cardolan was ravaged and the tower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], held by the men of Arthedain, was placed under siege.  King [[Arveleg I]] was slain and the tower was destroyed, but the coveted ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' escaped in the hands of the surviving men of Arthedain and was brought to [[Fornost]].<ref name="Palantiri16">[[Unfinished Tales]], [[The Palantíri]], note 16, [[Houghton Mifflin]] p. 413 </ref>

The Witch-king continued to press the men of Arthedain, laying siege to Fornost, and he might have taken over all of Arnor in that one offensive.  But [[Araphor]], the 18-year-old son of Arveleg, came to leadership and, with the help of the ancient elf [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]], repelled the Witch-king’s forces at Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref name="ten">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 321-322</ref>  [[Elrond]] brought an army of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] and [[Lothlórien]], and the Witch-king was pushed back and subdued.

===Twilight of Angmar===
The Witch-king sat silent in Carn Dûm, rebuilding his armies and preparing for a final assault on [[Arthedain]], last of the Arnorian kingdoms.  The [[Great Plague]] came and went in {{TA|1636|n}}, taking with it the last of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]].  The Witch-king sent [[barrow-wights]] to inhabit the barrows in [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]].<ref name="ten">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 321-322</ref> In {{TA|1974|n}}, he felt that his power was sufficiently restored to begin the advance.

His attack was sudden, but not unexpected.  King [[Arvedui]] sent a message to King [[Eärnil II]] of [[Gondor]] the year before, but help did not arrive in time.  [[Fornost Erain]] fell, and the Witch-king took up residence there in the palace.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref>  Arvedui held out as best as he might on the [[North Downs]], but at last fled north with the treasured ''[[palantíri]]'' of [[Amon Sûl-stone|Amon Sûl]] and [[Annúminas-stone|Annúminas]].  He would not return, for he perished in a shipwreck in {{TA|1975|n}}.  With him the ''palantíri'' were lost forever in the icy seas of [[Forod]].  The already-diminished North-kingdom ended, and [[Arnor]] fell.<ref name="ten">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 321-322</ref>

Meanwhile, a coalition in the south had formed.  Eärnil sent his son, [[Eärnur]], north with a great fleet, all that Gondor could spare. They arrived at [[Lindon]] and joined with the folk of Círdan.  Círdan summoned all that would come: surviving Dúnedain of Arnor and elves of Lindon.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref>  Even a company of [[Hobbits|hobbit]] archers went to their aide.<ref name="ten">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iii), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 321-322</ref>  The Witch-king had grown overconfident and, instead of staying behind his fortifications, initiated the attack.  The [[Battle of Fornost]] was fought on the plain between [[Nenuial]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king may not have anticipated the strength brought against him, but for whatever reason the alliance gained the upper hand. His army began to fall back toward Fornost, but Eärnur’s magnificent horsemen struck from the north and the Witch-king was routed.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref> 

He decided to flee to Angmar and the safety of Carn Dûm, but the cavalry, with Eärnur himself in the lead, overtook him.  Moreover, the ranks of the allies swelled, as an army of elves from [[Rivendell]] came led by the mighty hero of old, [[Glorfindel]].  Angmar was purged of men and orcs, and all seemed lost for the Witch-king in the face of such numbers. But the Witch-king himself came at the last, robed and masked in black and riding a black horse, and attempted to kill Eärnur with his own hands.  But Eärnur’s horse shied away and fled, and the Witch-king laughed.  But Glorfindel came on his white horse, and faced with such power the Witch-king fled.  He vanished into the shadows and no-one marked where he had gone.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref>

Eärnur wanted to pursue, but Glorfindel held him back and made his famous prophecy.

{{Blockquote|He will not return to this land.  Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.|Glorfindel, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', [[Appendix A]] (iv)}}

===Lord of Minas Morgul===
The Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and gathered the other Ringwraiths about him in {{TA|1980|n}}.<ref name="appendixB">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix B]]</ref>  Angmar and Carn Dûm were lost, and so in {{TA|2000|n}} the Witch-king began a two-year siege of [[Minas Ithil]], eventually capturing the place and turning it into his residence.  It was renamed [[Minas Morgul]], and the ''[[Ithil-stone|palantír]]'' was sent to Sauron.  The Witch-king sent an aura of fear in [[Gondor]], and much of [[Ithilien]] was deserted.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref>

Eärnur succeeded his father as King of Gondor, and still held the Witch-king in especial hostility due to his humiliation at the Battle of Fornost.  The year of his coronation the Witch-king sent him a taunting challenge, but [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]] the steward restrained Eärnur from rash action.  Seven years later the challenge was repeated, and Eärnur rode with a small escort to Minas Morgul.  None that rode thither ever returned, and there was no longer a King in Gondor.<ref name="eleven">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] pp. 331-332</ref>

After this the Witch-king bided his time.  He and the Nazgûl built up their armies, including the terrible new orc-race of [[uruks]].  In {{TA|2475|n}} he sent them out to capture [[Osgiliath]], which they did successfully.  They were driven out by [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], but Osgiliath now lay completely in ruins.  Boromir went on to retake Ithilien, so that even the Witch-king feared him.  But he was killed by a Morgul-wound, and so his rule was but twelve years.<ref name="twelve">[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[Appendix A]] (iv), [[Houghton Mifflin]] p. 333</ref>

===Hunt for the Ring===
Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951|n}}, and sent three of his Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]] (though the Witch-king was left in Minas Morgul).  Then, by lucky chance, the creature [[Gollum]] was captured and interrogated.  Under torture, the wretched creature revealed the tale of [[the One Ring]] and how it came to be in his possession.  But from his words Sauron misunderstod that the land of the hobbits who stole the Ring was on the banks of the [[Gladden River]], whence Gollum originally came from.<ref name="thirteen">{{UT|Hunt}}, [[Houghton Mifflin]] p. 338-341</ref> Sauron sent the Nine, under the leadership of the Witch-king, invisible and uncloaked, to search for the Ring after the assault of Osgiliath.

[[Khamûl]], the Witch-king’s lieutenant, reported that he was unable to find the “[[the Shire|Shire]]” in the vales of [[Anduin]].  The Witch-king was determined to search north and west until Gollum was found, or the Shire.  But plans were halted when Sauron received word of the prophecy in Gondor and the doings of the turncoat [[Saruman]], and concluded that the Wise did not yet have possession of the Ring.  He sent the Ringwraiths to [[Isengard]] in the form of [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], too late to prevent the escape of the captured wizard [[Gandalf]], but had words with Saruman.  Saruman, already a traitor to both sides due to his transparent lust for the Ring, fortified himself in Isengard.  The Witch-king did not have enough power with him to assault Saruman in his great fortress, but had words with him.  Saruman convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring was, and so the Nine passed into [[Rohan]] in search of him.<ref name="thirteen"/>

They came upon the traitor called [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] and questioned him.  The terrified man told them everything he knew; that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them.  The Witch-king spared Wormtongue’s life, foreseeing that Wormtongue would bring ruin to Saruman.  He divided his wraiths into four pairs, and went with the swiftest to [[Minhiriath]].  Along the way they captured several spies of Saruman, and found to their delight charts and maps of the Shire.  They sent along the spy to [[Bree]], warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Saruman.<ref name="thirteen"/>

They came to [[Sarn Ford]], but the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] prevented them from crossing.  They sent for their great captain, the chieftain [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], who alone could well resist the wraiths, but he was away, and the Ringwraiths captured the ford and killed many of the Rangers.<ref name="thirteen"/> The Witch-king sent three Ringwraiths under Khamûl into the Shire while he went east with the others.<ref name="appendixB">{{App|B}}</ref>  But they had come too late: the Ring had moved on in the hands of a hobbit, [[Frodo Baggins]].

===Pursuit of the Ring===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fire on Weathertop.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Fire on Weathertop'']]Khamûl was unsuccessful, but brought word from the spy they had spared in Bree.  The man had witnessed a vanishing act on Frodo's part, and had organized an attack on the inn.  The Witch-king guessed that Frodo would head east, and sent four wraiths to [[Weathertop]], the ruins of the tower he had destroyed long ago.  He went south along the [[Greenway]] and discovered nothing.  Gandalf followed them, but the Witch-king let him slip ahead, and attacked him on Weathertop.  Gandalf escaped at dawn, and again the Witch-king divided his force and sent four after the wizard.

The Ring walked almost right into his hands.  The captain of the Dúnedain, Aragorn II, had become the guide of the hobbits, and led them to Weathertop, where they were spotted and attacked.  The Witch-king advanced on Frodo, and the terrified hobbit put on the Ring, seeing them as they truly were.  When Frodo resisted, and invoked the name of [[Varda|Elbereth]], the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder. The tip of his blade broke off and sent poison through the hobbit’s veins.  Then Aragorn counterattacked with flaming brands.  The Witch-king departed with the other Nazgûl, believing that his objective was completed.

He resumed the pursuit quickly, though, and found that Khamûl had been driven from the [[Last Bridge]] by his old enemy [[Glorfindel]].  The Witch-king, who only had one companion with him, was likewise unable to confront him openly.  They regrouped and went south, rejoining with the other four.  They managed to pick up the trail of the company of the Ring, and despite hindrance from Glorfindel and Aragorn managed to pursue Frodo alone on [[Asfaloth]].  The pursuit came to the [[Ford of Bruinen]], and there Frodo compelled the horse to stop.  The Witch-king saw his defiance and laughed, breaking his sword with a movement of his hand.  But the waters of the [[Bruinen]] rose at [[Elrond]]'s command, sweeping the Nine downstream.<ref name="fourteen">[[The Fellowship of the Ring]], [[Flight to the Ford]]</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:Angus McBride - Gandalf facing Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Gandalf facing the Witch-king'']]
The Witch-king took the only surviving horse back to [[Mordor]], arriving there in December.  He then sent aid to the other eight Nazgûl, and they returned in secret.  In [[Minas Morgul]] they prepared for a grand invasion of [[Gondor]] at the order of their master.  The Witch-king was given by Sauron added "demonic" force.<ref name="fifteen">[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Letter 210]], p. 272</ref>  On 10 March {{TA|3019|n}}, the signal was given and Minas Morgul was emptied.  The Witch-king rode at the head of the army in black, upon a black horse, as he had in the time of the wars of Angmar.  As the Witch-king passed out of the gates of the dead city, he sensed the presence of Frodo.  He was disturbed, but continued on through Ithilien.

With the Witch-king in command, [[Osgiliath]] soon fell.<ref name="Siege">{{RK|Siege}}</ref> The defeat was attributed to his superior numbers, and his terrible presence which made all hearts to quail.  The [[Rammas Echor]] was breached, and the [[Pelennor Fields]] were overrun.  Other wraiths he sent out mounted on [[Fell beasts]].  [[Faramir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Denethor|Denethor II]]'s son, was wounded by a dart and the [[Black Breath|black breath]], but his company was saved by a sortie.  Then the Witch-king laid siege to [[Minas Tirith]] itself, sending fire and the heads of the dead Gondorians into the city via catapults.  Then he launched the assault.

He sent [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] out first, accompanying it in person so as to be the first to enter the city.  Three times Grond struck the gate, empowered by the sorcery of the Witch-king.  The third time the Gate shattered in a flash of fire.  The Witch-king passed into Minas Tirith, but was confronted by Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]].  Gandalf forbade him entry, but the Witch-king laughed and put on a show of power.

{{Blockquote|The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set.  The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark.  From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br>'Old fool!' he said.  'Old fool!  This is my hour.  Do you not know Death when you see it?  Die now and curse in vain!'  And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', [[The Siege of Gondor]]}}.

===The Fall of the Witch-king===
[[File:Nick Deligaris - Éowyn and Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|350px|Nick Deligaris - ''Éowyn and Nazgûl'']]
As Gandalf stood resolute before the Witch-king, the [[Rohirrim]] arrived. Thus he departed, mounting a fell beast and descending upon King [[Théoden]] who led the attack.  [[Snowmane]], the King's horse, collapsed with a dart in the side, and Théoden was crushed beneath him.  But the rider [[Dernhelm]] defied the Witch-king.  The Witch-king threatened Dernhelm with a terrible death, but the rider revealed that she was a woman, [[Éowyn]], and the Witch-king remembered the words of Glorfindel. He hesitated, but then moved forward. Éowyn decapitated the fell beast, but the Witch-king rose and struck her down with his mace, breaking her shield-arm. Then the hobbit [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] stabbed him in the sinew of his leg with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|blade of Westernesse]] (though there was much pain in Meriadoc's arm afterward), as he drew back to kill the woman.  Then Éowyn rose and drove her sword through where his invisible head was, and the sword broke as his crown toppled.  The Witch-king gave a great and horrible wail, perishing at last.<ref name="Pelennor">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

So the prophecy of Glorfindel was fulfilled, for the Witch-king did not fall at the hands of a man, but at the hands of [[Éowyn|a woman]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|a hobbit]].  With his defeat, and the coming of Aragorn II in the black ships, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was lost by Sauron.

==Names==
* Witch-king of Angmar - "Witch" most likely coming from his background in sorcery, and "king" after his establishment of the realm of Angmar in 1300.
* Witch-lord of Angmar - A variant of the above title.
* Lord of the Nazgûl
* Lord of the Ringwraiths
* Chieftain of the Ringwraiths
* Lord of the Nine Riders
* King of the Nine Riders
* Wraith-lord
* Wraith-king
* High Nazgûl
* Lord of Morgul
* Morgul-lord
* King of Minas Morgul
* Black Captain
* Captain of Despair
* [[Dwimmerlaik]]
* Lord of Carrion

==Etymology==
While in modern English ''witch'' has mostly female connotations, referring to a hag or sorceress, in middle-English ''wicche'' had no gender distinction; the preference of ''witch'' for female persons (the males referred more usually as ''wizzards'') evolved later through the centuries. 

Tolkien uses the archaic, gender-unspecific meaning of the term; of course, the word [[Wizards|Wizard]] refers exclusively to the [[Maiar]] [[Istari]].

==Inspirations==
An undead witch-king named ''Þráinn'' appears in ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrómundar_saga_Gripssonar Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]''. It is possible that this was Tolkien's source of inspiration.

The prophecy that the Witch-king would fall "not by the hand of man" and the fulfillment of the prophecy occurring as a technicality (being slain by a hobbit and a woman) bears a striking resemblance to the prophecy regarding the title character's death in Shakespeare's Macbeth, where it was foretold that Macbeth will be slain "not by man born of woman" and is then killed by Macduff, born by caesarian section. Tolkien was familiar with the play, having reputedly taken inspiration for the Last March of the Ents from the same source (See article ''[[Ents]]'' for details).

==Portrayal in adaptations == 
The Witch-king's true name is never given, and therefore among [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]], the Witch-king is often simply called ''Angmar'', after the name of the realm he founded and led. It is possible that he was one of the three [[Black Númenóreans]] Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly [[Isilmo]], a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. This possibility was adopted by the now defunct [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game and [[Mithril Miniatures]] where he is named ''Er-Murazor'', a Númenórean prince and younger son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]].

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is shown with no distinction from the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]]; all are robed in brown and black, and none seem to be able to talk clearly.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is portrayed as a humanoid figure with no head. Red eyes glare under a golden crown. His dialogue is more or less as in the books, albeit in a strange and somewhat unfitting electronic voice. After a stab from behind by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Éowyn]] beheads him. It is worthy of note that the Witch-king is seen with the [[Red Eye]] of [[Barad-dûr]] as his emblem and faction, rather than the grim moon of [[Minas Morgul]]. 

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is called the "Witch-king of [[Angmar]]", the "Lord of the [[Nazgûl]]", and the "Greatest of the Nine" by [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''; however, no other mention of the kingdom of Angmar itself is made. Also, in that film, there is no mention of [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy; there is only a claim among the enemy that "no man can kill" the Witch-king.  Like the other Nazgûl, he is depicted as a humanoid figure shrouded in a hooded black robe; his only distinguishing feature is a mask-like spiked helmet with a huge mouth. His first mention is when Gandalf tells [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while in Minas Tirith that the Dark Lord has not yet revealed his "deadliest" servant: the Witch-king, the one that "stabbed [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]]". 

:During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the Witch-king's army uses the ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] to break through the city gates early in the battle (after the failure of a lesser ram), and the Witch-king is not present to confront Gandalf as he is in the book. The confrontation takes place later, as Pippin and Gandalf race to the tombs to save [[Faramir]], and the Witch-king intercepts them. Unlike in the book, this meeting decisively favors the Witch-king, who breaks Gandalf's staff and throws the wizard to the ground before leaving to deal with the arrival of the [[Rohirrim]].  Gandalf's face shows obvious fear in this scene, in comparison to the resolution (for "victory or death") in the books.

:The Witch-king's final stand on the battlefield occurs with less dialogue than in the book, and the weapons used to defeat him are both mundane: Merry's sword is not a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], but rather the Rohirric sword that [[Théoden]] had as a child. This does makes it somewhat confusing in the film wether or not the Witch-King was truly destroyed in this fight like in the book, or wether we was temporarily incompacitated (like at the ford of Bruinen) and later perished along with his other fellow Nazgul due to the One Ring's destruction.

:Eight actors are known to have played some part of the Witch-king. 
# An unidentified extra portrayed the "King of Men" in the prologue. He was chosen to be the Witch-king simply because he was the smallest of the nine.
# [[Shane Rangi]] did the horse chase. 
# [[Fran Walsh]] provided the "Ringwraith scream".
# Effects technician Ben Price played the Witch-king in "many scenes"<ref>http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/07/072904lotrwetaprops.html</ref>
# [[Brent McIntyre]] is officially credited as the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He stabbed Frodo.
# [[Lawrence Makoare]] filled the robe of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.
# [[Mark Ferguson]] filled the heavy armoured costume when Makoare felt claustrophobic.<ref>http://www.markferguson.net/articles/interview_Nautilus20.html</ref>
# [[Andy Serkis]] provided the voice of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series) ]]:'''
:The Witch-king is mentioned to have been defeated years ago, and his body sealed by the "Men of the North" in a very deep and dark tomb in the "[[High Fells of Rhudaur]]".
