}}'''Númendil''' was the seventeenth [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]], succeeding his father upon his death. He was a leader of the [[Faithful]], and was a friend of [[Tar-Palantir]], the last [[King of Númenor]] to abide by the will of the [[Valar]]. It can be assumed that Númendil was a member of the Royal Council and an important Lord of [[Númenor]]. Though the name of his father is not known, his grandfather was [[Eärendur (Lord of Andúnië)|Eärendur]], the fifteenth [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Palantir</ref>

Nùmendil was the father of [[Amandil]], who succeeded him as [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. Amandil would later become the father of [[Elendil]], the founder of the kingdoms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].

==Etymology==
''Númendil'' means "Devoted to the [[Aman|West]]" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[númen]]'', 'west', and the suffix ''[[-ndil]]'', meaning 'devoted to').

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
[[Elentir]], intended to be another son of Númendil, was a character developed but never fully adapted into the formal history of Númenor. In one version of the story of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], his future wife [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]], the daughter of the current king, was betrothed to Elentir. However, she fell desperately in love with Pharazôn and chose to become his queen when he took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]]. This story is very different than the tale in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', where Ar-Pharazôn takes Míriel very much against her will in order to claim the Sceptre. In either case, Elentir disappeared before Númendil died, leaving Amandil as the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>
