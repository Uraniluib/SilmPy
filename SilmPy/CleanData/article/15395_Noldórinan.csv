'''Noldórinan''' is one of the rejected names of [[Beleriand]] which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] jotted down "on a page of rough working for the opening of the [[The Lay of Leithian|Lay]]" (of Leithian) when he was probably searching for a replacement of Broseliand, used so far.

All in all there were eight of these names: [[Golodhinand]], [[Noldórinan]], [[Geleriand]], [[Bladorinand]], [[Belaurien]], [[Arsiriand]], [[Lassiriand]], [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{LB|C1}}</ref>
