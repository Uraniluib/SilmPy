'''Bilbo's will''' was the legal document whereby [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] heir, came into possession of [[Bag End]] instead of the [[Sackville-Baggins Family]] after Bilbo's disappearance.  It was legally sound and included the signatures of seven witnesses in red ink, in accordance with [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] customs.<ref name="Party">{{FR|I1}}</ref>
 
==History==
By the time of [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], the Sackville-Baggins, especially [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]] and [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]], had been coveting Bag End for sixty years.  Bilbo forestalled them by creating a will that would transfer ownership of the valuable property to his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].<ref name="Party"/>  On the day after the party ([[23 September]]{{TA|3001}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>) Otho and Lobelia came to Bag End and demanded to see the will.  Otho read the will but could find no fault, and stumped off in disgust.<ref name="Party"/>
 
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When he wrote the fifth version of the first chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] included the information that Otho was a lawyer and that Bingo<ref group="note">Bingo Bolger-Baggins later became Frodo Baggins.</ref> would legally enter into ownership at midnight on [[23 September]].<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>
