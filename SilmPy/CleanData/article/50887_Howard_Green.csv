In [[2012]] he discovered a disordered bundle of papers on the top of one of a number of sacks of waste paper in the basement of the school. They were loosely tied with a red string and on the outer sheet was inscribed in large Lombardic capitals: '''[[Notion Club Papers|NOTION CLUB PAPERS]]'''.<ref name="Foreword">{{SD|2b}}</ref>

Later, it was discovered that the papers reported approximately one hundred meetings of a certain discussion group. The meetings took place between c. [[1980]] and [[1990]], and in [[2014]] he published the work.<ref name="Foreword"/>
