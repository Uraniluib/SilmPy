==Cover/Jacket Text== 
 
Three low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

A shipment of wine and ale has disappeared in North Ithilien. Firichal, a wealthy wine merchant has offered a reward for information and assistance. Are you brave enough to follow the Trail of the Wine Bandits? 

The tower of Barad Perras once withstood the efforts of besieging Orcs. Years later it was abandoned and forgotten... Recently, however, a band of Scara-hai Orcs has claimed the tower as a base from which to terrorize the area. Are you willing to face The Trouble at Littlehorn? 

The people of Minas Tirith speak of a strange band of Orcs and their sorcerous leader Gaurh√Ær. These Scara-hai have been bred for very special plans, plans about to come to their gruesome fruition. Do you have the courage to face The Master of Durthang? 

Danger is everywhere, but so are the rewards in these 3 exciting adventures!
