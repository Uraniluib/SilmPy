__NOTOC__
The '''Straight Road''' was the route that left the [[Middle-earth]]'s curvature through sky and space to the ethereal land of [[Aman]].

==History==
The Straight Road, so called because it followed the old path across [[Belegaer]] from before the [[Downfall of Númenor]] when the Flat World was [[Changing of the World|made Round]], was only kept open to [[Elves]], who were allowed to sail to it on their ships by a special grace of the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

By the [[Third Age]] the Elves would take ships to follow the Straight Road and return to Aman from the [[Grey Havens]] or [[Edhellond]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

Some mortals were allowed to take the Straight Road to Aman.  [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] sailed into the West on the [[White Ship]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> Later [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gimli]] were also permitted to depart for Aman.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> Long after the [[Fourth Age]], [[Ælfwine]] of England found the Straight Road and visited [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>

==Other writings==
[[Smith Smithson|Smith]] appears to have found a conceptually similar road, leading him to the land of "[[Faery]]".<ref>{{HM|SWM}}</ref>
