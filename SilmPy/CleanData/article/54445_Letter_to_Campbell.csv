{{blockquote|July 28th 1973<br/><br/>
Dear Professor Campbell,<br/><br/>
:I have now returned to Oxford after<br>
some further travelling, and write, rather belated-<br>
ly to thank you for your part in the events of<br> 
July 11th and 12th, which both in feasting and<br>
in ceremonial were to me the most resplendent<br>
academic occasion in which I have taken part.<br>
The festive occasions to my own surprise I sur-<br>
vived with unmarred pleasure, owing to the<br>
generous substitution of whisky for wine, and<br>
I am confirmed in my doctor's advice: 'you<br>
must transfer your allegiance wholly from<br>
Bacchus to Ceres'. At the laureation I<br>
felt like a hobbit would: as is exhibited in<br>
'The Lord of the Rings', especially by Merry<br>
and Pippin: great pride and delight in the re-<br>
ception of high honour and title, combined<br>
with (and in a way enhanced by) a difficulty<br>
^in believing that^ it was really happening to me, or was really<br>
deserved except by the generosity of my superiors.<br>
The words of the Address left me overwhelmed.<br>
Especially the words 'making him one of us'.<br>
I assure you that Edinburgh has gripped me<br>
fast; and though my 81 years had begun to<br>
make me reluctant to travel far, a journey back<br>
north, if opportunity and health allows, will<br>
not be reluctant.<br/><br/>
Yours sincerely<br/><br/>
J R R Tolkien<br/><br/>}}
