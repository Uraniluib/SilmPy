In the swamplands of [[Middle-earth]] lurked the evil phantoms called [[The Mewlips|Mewlips]], and flew the [[Gorcrows]], a race of birds. In these swamps also grew the '''Gallows-Weed'''. In [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] Lore, this tree-hanging weed is only known by name, but its physical description is never talked about or described. Few people who ever entered these marshes, and thus even saw these Gallows-Weeds, ever returned, thus there was no description of them.<ref>{{AB|Mewlips}}</ref>
