The '''Tower of Ecthelion''', also known as the '''White Tower''', was a tall white tower atop [[Minas Tirith]] which contained the throne of the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]] and a secret room housing a ''[[palantíri|palantír]]''. Although a tower had graced the highest point of [[Minas Tirith]] since ancient times, it was rebuilt by Steward [[Ecthelion I]] some three centuries before the [[War of the Ring]], and so gained his name. 

The Tower had "its eye upon many lands". It was because of this Tower that the city was later named Minas Tirith ("Tower of the Guard").<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - At the Court of the Fountain.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''At the Court of the Fountain'']]
The Tower of Ecthelion was 50 fathoms (300 feet) tall. The plain white standard of the Stewards of Gondor flew from its pinnacle. The Tower stood in the center of the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] on the seventh level of the city. In front of the Tower was the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] where the [[White Tree of Gondor]] grew.

Under the sun, the Tower's shapely form shone and glimmered like a spike of crystals, pearl and silver against the sky. White banners waved from its battlements.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

In the [[Tower Hall]] was the throne of the King of Gondor upon a dais, and at the foot the dais on the lowest step was a black chair where the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] sat. The royal court must have been also there.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "White Tower"</ref>

There was a chamber high in the Tower and above it in the summit, just under its dome, there was a secret room where the ''palantír'' of Minas Anor, the [[Anor-stone]] was kept.

==History==
The White Tower was first built by King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] in {{TA|1900}} to house the [[Anor-stone]] and the royal Throne. In {{TA|2698}}, the Tower was repaired and rebuilt by the Steward [[Ecthelion I]], for whom the Tower came to be named.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

On [[March 9]], {{TA|3019}}, [[Peregrin Took]] got his first glimpse of the Tower of Ecthelion as he rode with [[Gandalf]] to [[Minas Tirith]].

After the fall of [[Sauron]], on [[May 1]], the standard of the Stewards of Gondor was raised for the last time. That day [[Aragorn]] was crowned King and when he entered the Citadel, the [[Livery of Elendil]] bearing the Tree and the Stars was unfurled on the pinnacle of the Tower of Ecthelion.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

==Etymology==

Also called the White Tower. It was renamed the Tower of Ecthelion after the Steward Ecthelion I who rebuilt it. Also called the Tower of Denethor during the reign of Denethor II.
