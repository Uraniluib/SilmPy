'''Taniquetil''' or '''[[Oiolossë]]''', the great '''Holy Mountain''', was the highest of the mountains of [[Pelóri]] and the tallest peak in [[Arda]]. On its summit was raised [[Ilmarin]], the mansions of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].<ref name=SIndex/>

According to ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', it was raised 3,450 [[Valian Years]] (or 33,000 solar years) after the [[Valar]] arrived in [[Aman]].{{fact}} 

==Etymology==

''Taniquetil'' (or ''Taníquetil'') is [[Quenya]] (pronounced {{IPA|[taˈnikʷetil]}}) and means "high-snow-peak".<ref>{{PE|17}} pp. 26, 168</ref> The name can be analyzed as ''[[TĀ|ta-]]'' (cf. ''tára'') "high", ''[[nique]]'' "white"  and ''[[TIL|til]]'' "point".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>

The mountain was also called '''[[Amon Uilos]]''', the White Mountain, the Mountain of Manwë,<ref name=SIndex>{{S|Index}}</ref> ''Arfanyarassë'' (or ''Arfanyaras''; [[Quenya|Q]]. "High shining white peak"),<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp. 403, 416</ref> ''Taniquetilde Tára'',{{fact}} and ''[[Elerrína]]''.

Taniquetil is also called ''Oiolossë'' (also spelled ''Oiolosse''),<ref name=PE17/> which is [[Quenya]] and means "Ever-snow-white",<ref name=SIndex>{{S|Index}}</ref> "Everwhite/snowy",<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 26</ref> or "Everlasting snow".<ref name=Ety379/> The name seems to consist of ''[[oio]]'' "ever" (cf. root [[OY|OY-]])<ref name=PE17/><ref name=Ety379>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 379</ref> and ''[[losse]]'' "snow".<ref name=SIndex/>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Oiolossë is referred to as ''Sinsnáw, Sinsnǽwen'' "Ever-snow".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

In the ''[[Song of Eärendil]]'' it is named '''Hill of [[Ilmarin]]'''.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

In [[Valarin]] it was called ''dāhan-igwiš-telgūn'', or less properly ''Dahanigwistilgūn''.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, pp. 416-7 (note 36)</ref>
