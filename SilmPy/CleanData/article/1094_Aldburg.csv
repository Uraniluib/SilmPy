'''Aldburg''' was one of the oldest towns in [[Rohan]] and the first capital of the realm.<ref name=ut>{{UT|Isen}}, "Appendix", footnote 2</ref>

==History==
Aldburg was built by [[Eorl]] in the region known as the [[Folde]], east of [[Edoras]]. After [[Brego]], son of [[Eorl]], completed the [[Meduseld|Golden Hall]] and the Kings removed to Edoras, the lordship of Aldburg passed to his third son, [[Eofor]], from whom [[Éomund]], father of [[Éomer]], claimed descent.<ref name=ut/>

Even though Aldburg was in the King's Lands as part of the [[Folde]], it was the location of the muster of the [[East-mark]] as it was the most convenient location. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], it was the home of King [[Théoden]]'s nephew [[Éomer]], who was [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]].<ref name=ut/>
