'''''Rehabilitations and Other Essays''''' is a collection of essays by [[C.S. Lewis]]. 

The essay "The Alliterative Metre" includes a mention of an unpublished text by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]: "Professor Tolkien will soon, I hope, be ready to publish an alliterative poem". It remains unknown to which poem Lewis is referring, although suggestions have included "[[The Fall of Arthur]]", "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]", "[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]", or poems included in ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]''.<ref name=JF/>
