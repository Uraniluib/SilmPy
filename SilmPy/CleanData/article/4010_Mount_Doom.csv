'''Mount Doom''', or '''[[Orodruin]]''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[oˈrodruɪn]}} in three syllables), was a volcano in [[Mordor]]. 
==History==
[[Melkor]] created Mount Doom in the [[First Age]], and the name "Mordor" may have been given to the surrounding land before Sauron settled there because of its eruptions.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, p. 390 (note 14).</ref> When [[Sauron]] chose the land of [[Mordor]] as his dwelling-place in the [[Second Age]], Orodruin was the reason for his choice. He "''used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging.''"  The most famous result of his forging, and in fact the only one we know of for sure, was the One Ring. 

The mountain erupted in {{SA|3429}} signalling Sauron's attack to [[Gondor]] and it took the name [[Amon Amarth]] "Mount Doom".

In {{TA|2954}} Mount Doom reawakened and the last inhabitants of [[Ithilien]] terrified fled over [[Anduin]].<ref>{{App|B}}</ref> From then on it erupted sporadically until the end of the Age.

The [[Fellowship of the Ring]]'s [[Quest for the Ring|quest]] in the [[War of the Ring]] was to destroy the Ring at Mount Doom.

==Description==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - At the Foot of Mount Doom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''At the Foot of Mount Doom'']]
It stood alone in an empty plain, the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] and was connected to the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] with [[Sauron's Road]], rising about 4500 feet with its base about 3000 feet tall.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' entry "Orodruin"</ref><ref name=K/> The Road approached the east side of the base at a causeway and then wound up like a snake; at that point the Road seemed damaged by the lava and re-repaired several times.<ref name=K>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 146</ref>

Inside its cone, were the [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]] leading to the Crack of Doom, a fiery chasm where [[the One Ring]] was forged.

==Etymology==
''Mount Doom'' is the [[Westron|Common Speech]] translation of ''[[Amon Amarth]]'' in [[Gondor]].<ref name="Nomen"/>

The name was given because the volcano was linked in ancient and little-understood prophecies with the final end of the [[Third Age]], when [[the One Ring]] was found again.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 768-9</ref>
==Theories==
According to [[Karen Fonstad]], the Mount Doom was obviously a [[Wikipedia:stratovolcano|stratovolcano]], composited by alternating layers of ash and lava. Towering at only 4500ft, it was relatively short.<ref name=K/>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:[[Wikipedia:Mount Ngauruhoe|Mount Ngauruhoe]] was used as Mount Doom in some scenes. In long shots the mountain is either a large model or a CGI effect, or a combination. It was not permitted to film the summit of Ngauruhoe because it is sacred to the Maori of the region. However, some scenes which showed the slopes of Mount Doom were filmed on the actual slopes of [[Wikipedia:Mount Ruapehu|Mount Ruapehu]].
