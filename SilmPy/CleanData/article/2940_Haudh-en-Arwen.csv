'''Haudh-en-Arwen''', '''Ladybarrow''' (also called '''Tûr Haretha'''), was the funeral mound of [[Haleth]].
==History==
Haleth was the daughter of [[Haldad]] of the [[Haladin]], who led her people westward across [[Beleriand]] and founded the settlement of [[Men]] in the [[Forest of Brethil]]. After her death, the [[People of Haleth]] - as they had become known - raised a [[Barrows|barrow]] (known as Tûr Haretha or Haudh-en-Arwen) for her in the Forest.<ref name="West">{{S|West}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] term ''Haudh-en-Arwen''<ref name="West"/> can roughly be translated as "'''Ladybarrow'''". The actual translation would be "Mound of the Noble Maiden". The element ''Arwen'' had no direct connection with [[Arwen|Arwen Evenstar]], who lived millennia after Haleth's time, but it does give an insight into the origin of her name. [[Sindarin]] ''arwen'' means literally "high maiden", and is translated here as the "lady" in 'Ladybarrow'.

'''Tûr Haretha''' is the Mannish name of "The Ladybarrow".
