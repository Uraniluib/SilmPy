'''Ilmen''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈilmen]}}) was a part of the atmosphere that surrounded the world of [[Arda]], the region of airs where the [[stars]] are. 

Flesh can't survive the airs above Ilmen unaided. The [[Straight Road]] however traverses Ilmen.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

The [[Moon]] passed through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down the [[Chasm of Ilmen]] on its way back.{{fact}}

==Etymology==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that ''Ilmen'' is related to such words as ''[[Ilmarë]]'' and ''[[Ilmarin]]''<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''ilm-''</ref>.

In the ''[[Etymologies]]'', Ilmen is derived from the [[root]] [[GIL]] signifying "the region above air where stars are".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[GIL]]</ref> See also ''[[men (Elvish)|-men]]''
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the early schematic titled ''[[I Vene Kemen]]'', the middle layer of airs was marked as ''Ilwe'' ([[Qenya]]).

In the [[Ambarkanta]], Ilmen formed the outer layer of normal air, inside [[Vaiya]] and it was enclosed between the [[Mountains of Valinor]] and the [[Walls of the Sun]] mountains beyond the [[Eastern Sea]]. Below and inside Ilmen was the inner air, [[Vista]].

Ilmen is the level of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]] and the [[Stars]] so it was also called ''Tinwe-malle'' (star-street) and ''[[Elenarda (disambiguation)|Elenarda]]'' (Stellar Kingdom).<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, pp. 240-1, 242-3, 253</ref><ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 16</ref>
