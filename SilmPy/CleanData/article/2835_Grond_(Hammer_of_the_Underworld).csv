'''Grond''', called the Hammer of the Underworld, was [[Morgoth]]'s mighty mace that he bore when he fought [[Fingolfin]] before the doors of [[Angband]].  Each time Grond struck the ground it shook the land like a bolt of thunder, creating pits from which smoke and fire erupted.  However, Fingolfin evaded these lumbering strokes like a flash of lightning; he only fell when he grew weary and Morgoth was able to crush him under his shield.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Much later during the [[Third Age]] [[Sauron]] constructed a great battering ram, also called "[[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]]", designed solely to crush through the mighty gates of [[Minas Tirith]]. Named after his former master's weapon, this ram, powered by the [[Witch-king]], broke the city gates in four strokes.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>
