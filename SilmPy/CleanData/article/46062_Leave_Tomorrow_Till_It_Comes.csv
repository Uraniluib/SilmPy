==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Leave tomorrow till it comes;
Sleep will ease your mind.
With the dawn, you'll find
Problems realigned a different way
Than yesterday.

Leave tomorrow till it comes;
Time is moving fast.
Don't go pushing past;
Endings of the day were meant to last
Till yesterday.

Tangled dreams unfold,
And webs may disappear.
Stories are retold,
And cloudy thoughts will clear.

Leave tomorrow till it comes;
Sleep will ease your mind.
With the dawn, you'll find
Problems realigned a different way
Than yesterday...
Than yesterday.
