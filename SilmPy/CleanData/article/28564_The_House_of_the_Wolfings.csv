'''''A Tale of the House of the Wolfings and All the Kindreds of the Mark''''' is a novel by [[William Morris]]. It was the first of the author's 'prose romances', written during his last eight years. The novel was followed by ''[[The Roots of the Mountains]]''.<ref>Robert Boenig, [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=528 "The House of the Wolfings"], in ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. First published 14 February 2007. Accessed 2 September 2010.</ref>

In this novel Morris was perhaps the first to have used the English word ''[[Mirkwood]]'', likely derived from [[Old Norse]]. In the same manner, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had created ''Mirkwood'', although it can be seen in [[Letter to Michael George Tolkien (29 July 1966)|a letter to his grandson]] that he derived the word independently of Morris. Tolkien had, however, bought ''The House of the Wolfings'' as early as in spring [[1914]],<ref name=CGMorris>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', "Morris, William", pp. 598-604</ref> and commented in a 1960 letter that he was inspired by ''The House of the Wolfings'' in his depiction of the [[Dead Marshes]] and the approaches to the [[Morannon]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{L|226}}</ref>

Tolkien scholars have discussed several other possible instances of influence that ''The House of the Wolfings'' may have had on Tolkien: both specific ones such as the [[Red Arrow#Inspiration|Red Arrow]] and ''Mid-mark'' (compare ''[[Riddermark|Mark]]''), and a more general influence such as "''the Germanic sense of enemy and battle''"<ref>[[Marjorie J. Burns|Marjorie Burns]], "Echoes of William Morris's Icelandic Journals in J.R.R. Tolkien", in ''Studies in Medievalism, no. 3 (Winter 1991)</ref> and a literay style "''heavily laden with archaisms and poetic inversions in an attempt to recreate the aura of ancient legend''".<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', p. 70</ref>
