The '''East Wall of Rohan''' was the western edge of the hills of the [[Emyn Muil]] where they met the grasslands of [[Eastemnet]].  The line of the hills ended abruptly in a steep cliff-face, forming one of the boundaries of [[Rohan]]. The cliff was not impassable: a traveller in the hills could pass down onto the plain using a ravine that cut into the rock.<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>  

This was the route used during the [[War of the Ring]] by the [[Orcs]] that captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] (on [[27 February]] {{TA|3019}}), and by the [[Three Hunters]] who followed them at dawn the next day.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
