The '''Stair Falls''' were the falls beneath the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], where the Gate Stream of the [[Sirannon]] made a waterfall some thirty feet in height before flowing out across the grasslands of [[Eregion]]. The falls took their name from the stair carved beside them in the rock of the cliff.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>
