The '''Bywater Pool''' was a pond located in the eastern corner of the [[Westfarthing]] in [[the Shire]], just north of the town of [[Bywater]]. The main river of the Shire, [[the Water]], flowed into its western end and exited its eastern end. A stream from the [[Northfarthing]] (which may have been the [[Norbourn]]) entered Bywater Pool on its northern side.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

==History==
Before the [[War of the Ring]], Bywater Pool had had a pleasant row of old [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] holes in the north bank, with little gardens that had run down to the water’s edge. Along the Pool-side where the [[Hobbiton]] Road ran close to the south bank there had grown an avenue of trees. On [[2 November]], {{TA|3019|n}}, when the [[Travellers]] arrived at Bywater, they found the holes in the north bank deserted, their gardens filled with weeds, and the avenue of trees gone – replaced by a line of ugly new houses.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
