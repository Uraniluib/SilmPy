In light of later published writings by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Thomas Morwinsky]] published an article in ''[[Other Hands]]'' ("The History of Mount Gundabad", issue 28 January 2000) on suggestions for revisions for the ''Mount Gundabad'' module.

For use with this supplement, [[Mithril Miniatures]] released a set of metal miniatures (M93 - M102 ''Mount Gundabad'').
