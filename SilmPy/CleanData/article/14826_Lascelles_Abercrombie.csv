'''Lascelles Abercrombie''' ([[9 January]], [[1881]] â€“ [[27 October]], [[1938]]) became Professor of English Literature at the University of [[Leeds]], beating [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], who was then Reader in English Language, to the post. When Tolkien applied for the position of Rawlinson and Bosworth chair of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, it was Abercrombie who wrote a letter of recommendation, praising Tolkien.<ref name="CG">{{CG|RG}}, p. 1</ref>

{{blockquote|[J.R.R. Tolkien] has throughout acted as my advisor and collaborator in the conduct and policy of the department as a whole....I have never consulted him without gaining an illumination that can penetrate as well as expatiate. But I must not omit to mention that I have gained at least as much from the keen artistic sensibility as from the science of his scholarship.|Lascelles Abercrombie, [[25 June]], [[1925]]<ref name="CG"/>}}
