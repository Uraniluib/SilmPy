'''Lefnui''' was the westernmost of the many rivers of southern [[Gondor]], the Lefnui rose in the far west of the [[White Mountains]]. It followed an erratic course through the lands west of the hills of [[Pinnath Gelin]], until it emptied into the [[Bay of Belfalas]] through a long narrow firth.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  This river formed the eastern boundary of the [[Dr√∫waith Iaur]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, p. 384</ref>

The Lefnui played little part in history, though it was remembered by the [[Men]] of [[Rohan]]. When the [[Dunlendings]] invaded Rohan in {{TA|2758}}, they were aided by Gondor's enemies from the south. These sea-going marauders landed at Lefnui's mouth on their mission to overrun and destroy the [[Rohirrim]], though they would eventually be defeated.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>
