"I met Tolkien when I was preparing the film and he asked me if the film would be live-action or animated; he was relieved we weren't animating the film. Well, we all know what subsequently happened with Ralph Bakshi's version of Lord of the Rings which was animated."<ref name="Wired">[newspaperarchive.com], "[http://newspaperarchive.com/ca/manitoba/winnipeg/winnipeg-free-press/1981/04-04/page-35]", 4 April 1981 (accessed 8 September 2014)</ref>
