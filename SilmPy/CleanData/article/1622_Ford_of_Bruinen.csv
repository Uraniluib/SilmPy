The '''Ford of Bruinen''', also known a the '''Ford of Rivendell''', was the crossing of the [[Bruinen]] River on the [[Great East Road]] leading to the path to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Its waters were under the power of [[Elrond]].<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

On [[20 October]] {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Aragorn]] and [[Glorfindel]] led the hobbits (with [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] riding Glorfindel's horse, [[Asfaloth]]) towards the Ford. Suddenly the [[Nazg√ªl]] came down upon them and Glorfindel ordered his horse to flee. Asfaloth galloped madly ahead and just cleared the black horses that tried to cut off the escape. Frodo and his mount made it across the river where Frodo defied the Riders. Laughing, the Riders entered the Ford to capture Frodo but a sudden flash flood swept them away.<ref name="Flight"/>

In the house of Elrond, Frodo learned that his friends had lit flaming brands and rushed at the Riders when the flood appeared, which maddened their horses and caused them to plunge into the raging waters.  Stating that Elrond had caused the waters to rise, [[Gandalf]] could not resist mentioning that he added the horse-shapes to the flooding waters.<ref name="Meetings"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:In Scene 21, "The Flight to the Ford", [[Arwen]] replaced [[Glorfindel]], who is not in the movie. Frodo was too far gone from his wound to ride Asfaloth alone so Arwen directed the horse with Frodo in front of her. The scene showed a long chase to the river, which meant that Aragorn and the other hobbits were left far behind. Crossing the river, it was Arwen who defied the Nine Riders and the flash flood was summoned by her command.
