==Summary==
[[W.H. Auden|Auden]] had asked Tolkien for a contribution to a ''[[Wikipedia:Festschrift|festschrift]]'' for [[Nevill Coghill]]'s retirement.  He also asked if Tolkien knew that a "New York Tolkien Society" had been formed, fearing that it would be filled with lunatics.  Tolkien had nothing for the ''festschrift'' and hoped that the book would have a place to simply register good wishes.  The only thing he had ever written about Nevill was:
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Mr. Neville Judson Coghill
Wrote a deal of dangerous doggerill.
Practical, progressive men
Called him Little Poison-pen.</poem>
Tolkien wrote this when Coghill, under the name Judson, had written funny verses lampooning men like [[Wikipedia:Cyril Norwood|Norwood]] of St. John's.

Yes, sighed Tolkien, he had heard about the Tolkien Society.  Real lunatics do not join them but it still filled him with alarm and despondency.
