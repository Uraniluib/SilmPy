__NOTOC__
'''''Anaxarta''''' is a [[Quenya]] noun.<ref>{{WJ|IV}}, pp. 340-1</ref> 

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word is not obvious. 

Arguably, it is a compound of the words *''anaxara'' *"most rushing" (''[[an-]]'' "most" + *''axara'', a possible derivative from [[root]] [[SKAR]]; cf. ''[[ascar]]'') plus ''[[arta]]'' "exalted". The word *''Anaxararta'' would be simplified as ''Anaxarta''.<ref name=Wynne>[http://www.pa2rick.com/langlab/anaxartaron.html Analysis] of the phrase ''[[Anaxartaron Onyalie]]'' by [[Patrick H. Wynne]]</ref>

Other possibilities link the word to [[MÃ¡hanaxar]], therefore being of [[Valarin]] origin. In that case it could tentatively be an epithet for the [[Valar]] who participate in the Ring of Doom.<ref>[http://elfling.midgardsmal.com/index.php?topic=107104.0 Analysis] by [[David Salo]]</ref>

==Other forms==
*''Anaxartaron'' (gen.pl.) *"of the Valar" or *"of the Great Eagles"
