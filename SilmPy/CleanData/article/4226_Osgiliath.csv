'''Osgiliath''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[osˈɡiljaθ]}}) was the old capital city of [[Gondor]]. The city straddled the [[Anduin]] River at a point approximately half way between the cities of [[Minas Anor]] to the south-west and [[Minas Ithil]] to the north-east, and north of the nearby [[Emyn Arnen]].

In the Great Hall of the city the thrones of the sons of [[Elendil]] were set side by side. In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the [[Dome of Stars]], which housed the [[Osgiliath-stone]], the greatest of the seven ''[[Palantíri]]''.<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

==History==
Founded by [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]<ref name="rings"/> near the end of the [[Second Age]],<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> Osgiliath was designated the capital of the southern Númenórean kingdom in exile, [[Gondor]]. Soon after its founding, Sauron attacked and took [[Minas Ithil]] in {{SA|3429}} and then moved westward. While Isildur sought aid from the north, [[Anárion's defense of Osgiliath|Anárion defended the city]]. When the army of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] arrived and later defeated [[Sauron]] the threat to the city was lifted.<ref name="rings"/> Thereafter, for over a thousand years, Osgiliath was the capital of Gondor, as well as its largest and most important city.

The beginning of the city's decline came in {{TA|1437}} when it was sacked and burned, after [[Siege of Osgiliath|a siege]] by the rebel [[Castamir|Castamir's]] forces during the [[Kin-strife]]. It was during this siege that the Osgiliath-stone was lost in the River. The [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}} led to further depopulation with many victims, and those who fled never returned. The city began to fall into ruin; the capital was moved to the more secure [[Minas Anor]] in {{TA|1640}}.

Over the next few hundred years, Gondor endured many military defeats east of the [[Anduin]], especially the fall of Minas Ithil in {{TA|2002}}. Osgiliath became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Osgiliath was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being [[Uruk-hai attack on Osgiliath|captured]] temporarily by [[Uruk-hai]] in {{TA|2475}} until it was liberated by Steward [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Over the following centuries, the western part of the ruined city was under the control of Gondor, and was at times provided with a military garrison as a means of defending the crossing of the Anduin. The eastern part, with [[Ithilien]], was disputed territory, under Gondor's control for most of the rule of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], but in June of {{TA|3018}} it was [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|taken and occupied]] by [[Sauron|Sauron's]] forces and its last bridge fell. This attack some later considered the beginning of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="great">{{App|Great}}</ref>

In the following March, well into the War, Sauron launched a full-scale invasion of Gondor west of the Anduin, and despite the [[Rangers of Ithilien|Rangers']] [[Faramir's defense of Osgiliath|defense of the western part of the city]], Osgiliath quickly fell to Sauron's forces,<ref name="great"/> but it was reclaimed by Gondor after Sauron's ultimate defeat a few weeks later.

After the War, Osgiliath was apparently rebuilt,{{fact}} but it never became as great as it once was. [[Minas Tirith]] remained the capital and King's city.{{fact}}

==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name ''Osgiliath'', "Citadel of the Stars", consists of the elements ''[[ost]]'' ("fort, citadel") + ''[[giliath]]'' ("hosts of stars").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 232 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref><ref name=RGEO>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 73</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:War in Middle Earth - Osgiliath.png|thumb|150px]]

Because the city was not visited in the books, it did not appear in many adaptations.

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Osgiliath is one of the many maps of this game. The maps shows the bridge but the city itself is not shown.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:After capturing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Faramir]] takes them to Osgiliath, in the hope of harnessing the power of [[The One Ring|the Ring]] to the betterment of Gondor. Osgiliath is fully ruined, and partly flooded. After being attacked by several [[fell beasts|winged Nazgûl]], Faramir releases them.

:In a scene in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Faramir has a flashback. [[Boromir]] reclaims the city for Gondor, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Boromir, Faramir and [[Denethor]].

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
: [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] and his [[orcs]] finally breach the defences of the Gondorian troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. [[Madril]] is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to [[Minas Tirith]], they are beset by the [[Nazgûl]], only to be saved by [[Gandalf]].

:Not impressed by Faramir's deeds, and more upset about the loss of Osgiliath, Denethor sends his son back to Osgiliath, but his company is slaughtered, and Faramir badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the [[Causeway Forts]] in the book.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Concept Art of Osgiliath.png|thumb|150px]]
'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Concept art of Osgiliath was created by [[Snowblind Studios]] and appears in the trailer '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKu_v_NH7Ro&feature=player_embedded#! The Lord of the Rings: War in the North - Dev Video: Art Direction Process]'''. It is unknown if Osgiliath will appear in the game.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Osgiliath was an area in the Eastern Gondor region. At the eastern entrance were the Gates of the Moon, beyond which was the Court of [[Isildur]]. At the western entrance were the Gates of the Sun and the Court of [[Anárion]]. The Palace of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] was in the north-west corner of the city. After Osgiliath was overrun by the [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-host, [[Mablung]] and [[Damrod]] led the surviving [[Rangers of Ithilien]] in the city into hiding in the culverts.
