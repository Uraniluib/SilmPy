{{disambig-more|Inland Sea|[[Inland Sea (disambiguation)]]}}
The '''Sea of Núrnen''' also known as '''Lake Nurnen''' was an inland sea in [[Mordor]].

The lake was fed by all four (unnamed) major water courses that traversed most of Mordor, before flowing into Nurnen.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Nurnen"</ref><ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref><ref>[[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref>

It held bitter water not suitable for drinking, but the area around it, [[Nurn]], was fertile enough (watered by a river system coming from the [[Ephel Dúath]]) to feed the entire armies of [[Sauron]].

==Etymology==

''Núrnen'' is glossed as "sad-water".<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 457</ref><ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] also suggested the form ''Nûrnen'' ("death, dead water"), and noted the related [[Sindarin]] word ''[[gurth|guru]]'' ("death").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 87</ref>

The name is commonly understood to be [[Sindarin]],<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 457</ref><Ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Giraudeau]]|articleurl=http://lambenore.free.fr/downloads.html|articlename=''Parma Eldalamberon'' 17: Sindarin Corpus (p. 45)|dated=|website=[http://lambenore.free.fr/index_eng.html Lambenórë.free.fr]|accessed=14 July 2011}}</ref>

==Commentary==
In ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] assumed that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and Sea of Núrnen were the remnants of the inland [[Sea of Helcar]]. The atlas was however published before ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', where it was revealed that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] existed already in the [[First Age]], as an apparently different body of water than the Sea of Helcar.

==Portrayal in adaptions==
