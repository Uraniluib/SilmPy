The '''Middle Kingdom''' was a long-established realm in the midlands region of [[England]].  It was the domain of King [[Augustus Bonifacius]].  One of the villages within the realm was called [[Ham]] and there lived [[Farmer Giles]].

King Augustus Bonifacius was not a good ruler of the land.  He was greedy, uncaring of his heirlooms, and kept a retinue of worthless knights.  Eventually his misrule led to Farmer Giles' decision to establish himself as an independent lord and eventually the king of the new [[Little Kingdom]].  Due to the tamed dragon [[Chrysophylax]] that Giles had in Ham, Augustus Bonifacius was unable to prevent the separation of Giles' realm from the Middle Kingdom.<ref>[[J.R.R.
