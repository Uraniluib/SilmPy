__NOTOC__
'''cára''' also '''cas'''<ref>{{VT|49}} p. 17</ref> (pl. '''cari'''<ref>{{PE|14}} p.68</ref>) means "head" in [[Quenya]].

==Etymology==
The word derives from earlier ''cáza''<ref>{{PE|17}} p.188</ref> < [[PQ]] *''kāsa'', [[root]] [[KAS]]<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>.

The short form retained the ''s'' being final, but again, it evolved into ''r'' when inflected.
==See also==
*''[[cassa]]'' "helmet"
==Other versions==
''[[The Etymologies]]'' show a reverted case: the nominative is ''cá'''r''''' and the inflected form ''ca'''s'''i''. It represents a very early phonological scenario of the language, as seen in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]''. Since the ''Etymologies'' have the newer, reversed scenario, the case of ''cár'' appears as an anomaly among similar words. Tolkien later revised it to be consistent with his concurrent scenario.

==Inspiration==
''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B1 Κάρα]'' means "head" in Ancient Greek.
