'''Nimrodel''' was the small river that rose in the eastern foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]], and flowed east to meet the [[Celebrant]] on the western borders of [[Lothlórien]]. When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] came to the river they could hear it splashing over a waterfall on their right.  There used to be a [[Bridge of Nimrodel|bridge]] but it had long ago disappeared.  It was said that the water of the stream was "''healing to the weary''". After passing through [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], the Fellowship crossed and stopped by the Nimrodel to rest.<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>
