The complete ''Library of Great Authors'' series gives you a comprehensive survey of literature's best-loved, most esteemed authors.This lively guide explores the life of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and the historical and literary movements that influenced him. It provides an intimate look at Tolkien, from his love of pipe-smoking, to his distinguished academic career, to his experiences in combat. With detailed analysis of his astonishing novels, it explains why he provoked such mixed reactions from distinguished readers, one of whom called ''The Lord of the Rings'' "inflated, over-written, tendentious, and moralistic in the extreme," and one of whom likened him to Shakespeare. This guide shows why Tolkien, one of literature's most influential and controversial fantasy writers, inspires such passion in his readers.}}
