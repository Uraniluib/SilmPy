This [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Canto]] first speaks of [[Beren]] and his bliss.  Then it tells of [[Lúthien]]’s return and their dance, and how [[Daeron|Dairon]] espied them, and as he loved Lúthien he betrayed them to [[Thingol]].  Then how Lúthien led Beren into [[Menegroth]] after Thingol promised her that his life would be spared.  There he requested the hand of Lúthien, and Thingol, as he was bound to his oath not to harm Beren, in his wrath gave the bride-price as a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]]. Then Beren laughed as if it were a small thing, and left the hall with the promise to bring one back.  This fourth canto can be considered the true beginning of the quest.

== Concerning the Canto ==
This Canto begins with an elaborate description of Beren's happiness.
<blockquote>
''He lay upon the leafy mould''<br>
''his face upon the earth’s bosom cold''<br>
''aswoon in overwhelming bliss''<br>
''enchanted of an elvish kiss''
</blockquote>

Then they dance in joy together.
<blockquote>
''there flitting just before his feet''<br>
''she gently chid with laughter sweet;''<br>
''‘Come! dance now, Beren, dance with me!''<br>
''For fain thy dancing I would see.''
</blockquote>

Then Dairon, who is said to have loved Lúthien, espies them. 
<blockquote>
''Thus fleeting fast their short hour flies,''<br>
''while [[Dairon]] watches with fiery eyes,''<br>
''haunting the gloom of tangled trees''<br>
''all day, until at night he sees''<br>
''in the fickle moon their moving feet,''<br>
''two lovers linked in dancing sweet''
</blockquote>

And he first casts a spell of silence on the wood, and gives hints to Thingol about the meeting.
<blockquote>
'' 'but kings see not—though queens, maybe,''<br>
''may guess, and maidens, maybe, know.''<br>
''Where one went lonely two now go!’''
</blockquote>

The King understands swiftly his meaning, and grows angry.
<blockquote>
'' '. . .Who is he<br>
''that earns my wrath?  How walks he free<br>
''within my woods amid my folk,<br>
''a stranger to both beech and oak?'
</blockquote>

Then Dairon saw Lúthien, and wished he had not spoken.  Lúthien quickly explains.
<blockquote>
'' 'Far in the mountain-leaguered North,<br>
''my father,' said she, 'lies the land<br>
''that groans beneath King Morgoth's hand.<br>
''Thence came one hither, bent and warn<br>
''in wars and travail, who had sworn<br>
''undying hatred of that king;<br>
''the last of [[Bëor]]'s sons, they sing. . .
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'' '. . .a sword unconquered, neck unbowed,<br>
''a heart by evil power uncowed.<br>
''No evil needst thou think or fear<br>
''of Beren son of Barahir!<br>
</blockquote>

Lúthien had Thingol swear not to kill or imprison Beren, and then led him to and into Menegroth.  A vibrant description follows (see ''[[Menegroth]]'').  Beren was too stunned to answer any questions, until he looks in Melian's eyes and gains courage.
<blockquote>
''. . .and thence was slowly drawn his gaze<br>
''to Melian's face.  As from a maze<br>
''of wonder dumb he woke; his heart<br>
''the bonds of awe there burst apart<br>
''and filled now with the fearless pride of old;<br>
''in his glance now gleamed an anger cold.<br>
</blockquote>

He speaks bravely to Thingol about his love for Lúthien:
<blockquote>
'' '. . .Thy dearest treasure I desire;<br>
''nor rocks nor steel nor Morgoth's fire<br>
''nor all the power of Elfinesse<br>
''shall keep that gem I would possess.<br>
''For fairer than are born to Men<br>
''A daughter hast thou, Lúthien.'<br>
</blockquote>

Daeron's initial anger returns and he demands death for Beren.  Thingol reluctantly restrains himself due to his promise to his daughter, and threatens to let him wander interminably in Menegroth, never finding his way out of the caves.  Beren openly compares him with Morgoth in the twisting of oaths, and holds up the [[Ring of Barahir]].  Melian whispers to Thingol that it will not be by his hand Beren will fall, and Thingol sees then the love of Lúthien for him.
<blockquote>
'' 'Fairest of Elves!  Unhappy Men,<br>
''children of little lords and kings<br>
''mortal and frail, these fading things,<br>
''shall they then look with love on thee?'<br>
</blockquote>

Thingol's speech mocks Beren's own as he places the ultimate quest before him.
<blockquote>
'' '. . . A treasure dear I too desire,<br>
''but rocks and steel and Morgoth's fire<br>
''from all the powers of Elfinesse<br>
''do keep the jewel I would possess.<br>
''Yet bonds like these I hear thee say<br>
''affright thee not.  Now go thy way!<br>
''Bring me one shining Silmaril<br>
''from Morgoth's crown, then if she will,<br>
''may Lúthien set her hand in thine;<br>
''then shalt thou have this jewel of mine.'<br>
</blockquote>

Follows is a paragraph about the history of the Silmaril, and then Beren laughs, and bids farewell to Tinúviel, and departs.  Melian then gets her word in to Thingol.
<blockquote>
''Then clear in the silence the cold words rang<br>
''of Melian: 'Counsel cunning-wise,<br>
'' 'O king!' she said.  'Yet if mine eyes<br>
''lose not their power, 'twere well for thee<br>
''that Beren failed his errantry.<br>
''Well for thee, but for thy child<br>
''a dark doom and a wandering wild.'<br>
<br>
'' 'I sell not to Men those whom I love'<br>
''said Thingol, 'whom asll things above<br>
''I cherish; and if hope there were<br>
''that Beren should ever living fare<br>
''to the Thousand Caves once more, I swear<br>
''he should not ever have seen the air<br>
''or light of heaven's stars again.'<br>
</blockquote>

The final three lines wrap up this extensive canto, sad and foreboding.
<blockquote>
''But Melian smiled, and there was pain<br>
''as of far knowledge in her eyes;<br>
''for such is the sorrow of the wise.<br>
</blockquote>
