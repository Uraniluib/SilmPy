{{Pronounce|Draugluin.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Draugluin''' (died {{FA|465}}<ref>{{GA|182}}</ref>) was the first [[Werewolf]].

Bred from wolves and inhabited with an evil spirit sent by [[Morgoth]] himself, Draugluin was the sire of all Werewolves of [[Beleriand]], and dwelled with his master [[Sauron]] in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], the former watchtower of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]].

He was slain by [[Huan]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], though he informed Sauron that Huan was present. [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] used his pelt to sneak into [[Angband]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Draugluin was the sire of [[Carcharoth]] and many other Werewolves. It is probable the [[Wargs]] of the [[Third Age]] were descended from him, as these wolves could speak, suggesting they had ''[[fëar]]''.
He may have been a fallen [[Maiar|Maia]].

== Etymology ==
Draugluin means "Blue Wolf" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[draug]]'' = "wolf" and ''[[luin]]'' = "blue"),<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> in reference to the color of his pelt.
