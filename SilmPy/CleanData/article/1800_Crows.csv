'''Crows''' are black omnivorous birds sometimes associated with battles due to their taste for carrion.

==History==
The crows encountered by [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] during the quest to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> were mostly harmless.  During the scouting expedition to the [[Front Gate]] of the Lonely Mountain the crows were considered "ominous" and [[Balin]] distrusted them,<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref> though later he called them merely "nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude as well".<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

The most feared variety in the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]] was the large type known as ''[[crebain]]''.  On [[8 January]] {{TA|3019|n}} the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] entered [[Hollin]]<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> and were spied upon by these large crows from [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] and [[Dunland]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>  The [[Rohirrim]] were aware that [[Saruman]] made use of ''crebain''; on [[30 February]]<ref name="Great"/> [[Éomer]] told [[Aragorn]] that Saruman's "birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky".<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> Crows may actually just be another name for Ravens as they looked and acted exactly the same.

==Etymology==
A [[Quenya]] word for "crow" is ''quáko'', derived from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''k(a)wāk''.<ref>{{WJ|AD}}, p. 395</ref> Another Quenya word for "crow" is ''korko'', and the [[Noldorin]] cognate of the same meaning is ''corch''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 362 (root [[KORKA|KARKA-]])</ref> In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s very early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "crow" is ''crunc'' (pl. ''crunghin'').<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 27</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s plot notes for the second phase of writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'', there was no distinction between crows and ravens as ominous birds.<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, p. 362</ref>  When the scouting party went to view the [[Front Gate]] [[Balin]] did not like the ravens nearby, stating that they looked "like spies of evil".<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}, p. 472</ref>  However, when the Company needed to learn of the death of [[Smaug]] Tolkien "rehabilitated" the ravens, making them friendly to the Dwarves, and replaced all negative raven-references with crows.<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}, note 4, p. 479</ref>
