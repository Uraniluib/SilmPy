'''Prisca Bolger, n√©e Baggins''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Prisca was the second child and daughter of [[Polo Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> She married [[Wilibald Bolger]], and had three children: [[Wilimar Bolger|Wilimar]], [[Heribald Bolger|Heribald]] and [[Nora Bolger|Nora]]. Her husband passed away before {{SR|1401}}, but she attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with her children.<ref>{{App|Bolger|50}}</ref><ref group=note>[[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|The 50th Anniversary edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] includes Prisca as a guest at the Farewell Party. In older editions of Appendix C, Prisca did not appear as an attendee. Robert Foster in his ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' thus states that Prisca died ''before'' {{TA|3001}} (entry for Prisca Bolger).</ref>
==Etymology==
''Prisca'' is a Latin/Italian word meaning "former, old" from which derives the name [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]].<ref>http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Priscilla</ref>
