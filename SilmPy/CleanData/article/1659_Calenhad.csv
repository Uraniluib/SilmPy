'''Calenhad''' was the penultimate [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon-hill]] of [[Gondor]], being the sixth from east to west and located to south-east of [[Firienholt]].

Calenhad is described as being a small, green, treeless hill which was slightly bigger and taller than [[Erelas]].<ref name="VT">{{VT|42a}}, pp. 19-20</ref> Calenhad was seldom lit and its lighting during the [[War of the Ring]] indicated great urgency.

On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
It is suggested in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that Calenhad probably means "green space" from ''[[calen]]'' "green" and ''sad'' ([[lenition|lenited]] to ''had'') "place, spot".<ref name="UT">{{UT|Index}}</ref> In "[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]" [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] suggested that the second element may be ''s√¢dh'' "sward, turf".<ref name="VT"/>
