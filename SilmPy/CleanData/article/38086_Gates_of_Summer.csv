The '''Gates of Summer''' was a great feast held in [[Gondolin]] when the [[Gondolindrim]] sang as the [[Sun]] rose. 

It was upon the morning of this feast that [[Morgoth]]'s armies attacked Gondolin, beginning the (in)famous [[Fall of Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|23}}</ref><ref>{{SM|Q16}}, p. 144</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==

In early versions of the [[Legendarium]], more details are provided about the feast: '''Tarnin Austa''' (meaning "Gates of Summer" in Gnomish, an older draft of Sindarin) was held on the first day of summer.  It was custom to begin a solemn ceremony at midnight, continuing it until dawn of Tarnin Austa.  No-one could speak from midnight to daybreak, but upon the rising of the [[Sun]] they would burst into ancient songs, with choirs standing upon the eastern wall.  At that time the city was filled with silver lamps, and lights of jeweled colors hung on the branches of the new-leaved trees.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, pp. 172, 211, 347</ref>

In the early 1920s as Tolkien continued to evolve his ideas of [[Gnomish]] phonology, vocabulary, and plural-formation, he changed the name of the festival to ''Ternin Awest''<ref name="PE13">{{PE|13}}</ref>{{rp|153}} (or ''Ennyn Awest'') in the Noldorin Word-lists, with the festival's [[Qenya]] name being ''Andonavestan''.<ref name="PE13" />{{rp|143}} In his c. 1923 Noldorin Dictionary, Tolkien further emended ''Ternin'' to ''Teirn'',<ref name="PE13" />{{rp|160}} reflecting his next conception for pluralizing [[tarn]] "gate".<ref name="PE13" />{{rp|153}}
