The '''Barrowfield''' was a field outside the wall and dike of [[Edoras]] where the [[Kings of Rohan|Rulers of Rohan]] were buried. By the end of the [[Third Age]] there were two rows of tombs: one for the First Line ([[Eorl]] to [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]) and one for the Second Line ([[Fréaláf]] to [[Théoden]]). The main road leading to the city passed between these two rows.<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

[[Simbelmynë]] grew on the western side of the mounds, and more thickly on Helm's.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

It is not known if the Kings of the Third Line (starting with [[Éomer]]) were still buried there during the [[Fourth Age]].
