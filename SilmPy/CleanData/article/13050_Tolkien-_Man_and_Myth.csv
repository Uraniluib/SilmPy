===From the Publisher===

{{blockquote|[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' may be one of the greatest books of the twentieth century, but as an author Tolkien is often misunderstood.This study of his life and work reveals the facts and confronts the myths. It observes his relationships with literary colleagues and his uneasy acquaintance with [[C.S. Lewis]], the author of the Narnia books. It looks at the culture and background in which he wrote, his uneasiness with possessions and his religious faith.It also enters the world created by him in the seven books published during his lifetime, and explores 'Middle Earth' (''sic'') represented in his thinking. Myth, for Tolkien, was not a leap from reality but a leap into reality. These fascinating insights into the master writer make it possible to understand both the man and the myth he created.}}
