{{pronounce|Quenya - Valar.mp3|Gilgamesh}}

The '''Valar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Exilic Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈvalar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈβalar]}}; sg. '''Vala''') were the '''Powers of Arda''' who shaped and rule the world. They lived on the Western continent of [[Aman]].

==Origins==
The Valar were [[Ainur]], [[spirits]] that were brought into being by [[Ilúvatar]]'s thought, and He may therefore be considered their father. Some of the Ainur were also considered siblings "in the thought of Ilúvatar". Each was granted insight into a specific part of Ilúvatar's thought, and was therefore more aligned in spirit with that part. The only exception was [[Melkor]], who was granted insight into every part of Ilúvatar's thought and was the mightiest of the Ainur.

After singing the [[Ainulindalë]], the Ainur witnessed the Vision of [[Ilúvatar]] and the creation of [[Eä]] (the Universe). Many Ainur chose to enter [[Eä]], agreeing not to leave it until the end of Arda (the World). The fourteen greatest Ainur who entered Eä, save [[Melkor]] who rebelled against Ilúvatar, were called the Valar. After entering Eä, the Valar and their followers—those [[Maiar]] who remained loyal to Ilúvatar and rejected Melkor's rebellion—started shaping Arda using their godlike powers over its physical matter, preparing it for the awakening of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] ([[Elves]] and [[Men]]). Doing so required combating the evils of Melkor, who came to Arda to claim it as his own.  

As Ainur, the Valar were divine, immortal spirits who had no physical body and could remain invisible. Nonetheless, they often took the shapes of Men, Elves, or other forms of nature. 

Some called the Valar "[[gods]]," but they were actually emissaries or regents of Ilúvatar, and they were not to be themselves worshiped.<ref name="L156">{{L|156}}</ref> Their purpose was not to be lords or masters of the Children of Ilúvatar, but rather to serve as elders and guides.<ref name=SI>{{S|I}}</ref><ref>{{S|1}}</ref> The Valar were prohibited from depriving the Children of their free will,<ref>{{MR|P4i}}, p. 339</ref><ref>{{PM|XI2}}, p. 334</ref> killing or otherwise using force against them,<ref name="L156" /><ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 350</ref> or dominating them through displays of angelic power.<ref name="L156" />

Like all Ainur, the Valar had witnessed much the unfolding of the history of Arda in the Vision of Ilúvatar, but not all of it. Parts of this history, and certain parts of Ilúvatar's thought, such as the true nature and destiny of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], remained hidden from them.<ref name=s3>{{S|3}}</ref>

==Names==

These are the names of the Valar as they were known to the [[Eldar]]. 

=== Lords of the Valar ===
* '''[[Manwë]] Súlimo''', King of the Valar, husband of Varda
* '''[[Ulmo]]''', King of the Sea 
* '''[[Aulë]] the Smith''', husband of Yavanna
* '''[[Oromë]] Aldaron''', the Great Rider, husband of Vána
* '''[[Mandos]] (Námo)''', Judge of the Dead, husband of Vairë 
* Lórien ([[Irmo]]), Master of Dreams and Desires, husband of Estë
* [[Tulkas]] Astaldo, Champion of Valinor, husband of Nessa

=== Queens of the Valar (''Valier'') ===
* '''[[Varda]] Elentári''', Queen of the Stars, wife of Manwë

* [[Estë]] the Gentle, wife of Irmo
* [[Vairë]] the Weaver, wife of Mandos

In bolded names are the eight greatest of the Valar known as '''High Ones of Arda''' or '''Máhani''' and '''[[Aratar]]''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Rodyn'') "Exalted". Melkor, the most powerful of all, is not counted among them.

The brothers [[Irmo|Lórien]] and [[Mandos]] are referred to collectively as the '''''[[Fëanturi]]''''' or "Masters of Spirits".

In Middle-earth, the individual Valar were known by other names in other languages. For example in [[Sindarin]], Varda was called "Elbereth".  [[Men]] knew them by many other names, sometimes referring to them as "gods" at first. The [[Dwarves]] called Aulë, their creator, ''[[Aulë#Names and etymology|Mahal]]''. The [[Rohirrim]] knew Orome as ''[[Béma]]''.

==History==
When the Valar entered [[Eä]], Manwë and Melkor fought, and Manwë called other spirits to help him in his battle.  Among these were the other Valar and the [[Maiar]]. After this [[First War with Melkor]], the Enemy withdrew from the battle into distant places of [[Eä]], and the others continued to shape the World.  

Long before the [[Awakening of the Elves]], the Valar, namely Yavanna, created the [[Two Lamps]] that illuminated the world, and while they were dwelling in the isle of [[Almaren]], nature prospered in the [[Spring of Arda]]. But Melkor saw this, and returned to fight for control of Arda, and marred the world by having Ungoliant destroy the Lamps. The Valar retreated to [[Aman]] and founded [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> Outside the golden gates of the city [[Valimar]], the Valar gathered in [[Máhanaxar]] to hold their great councils, bathed in the light of the [[Two Trees]], and some of the most momentous decisions of Eä's history were made.

While they dwelt in Valinor, most of Arda was dark and under the control of Melkor. Eventually the Valar (even Ulmo) came to the [[Ring of Doom]], and fearing about what would befall the Children, they decided a [[War for Sake of the Elves]], at the end of which they broke [[Utumno]] and [[Chaining of Melkor|Imprisoned Melkor for three Ages]]. It was decided to invite the Elves to Valinor. [[Ulmo]], despite initially disagreeing with this decision, helped the [[Eldar]] traverse the [[Great Sea]] to the [[West]]. During that period the Valar welcomed the [[Calaquendi]] in Valinor and they prospered under their guidance and the holy [[Light of Valinor]].<ref name=s3/>

But Melkor and [[Ungoliant]] killed the Two Trees and their [[Light of Valinor|Light]], and the Valar and the Elves mourned the [[Darkening of Valinor]]. [[Fëanor]], the most gifted of the Elves, rebelled against the Valar and refused to surrender the [[Silmarils]] to rekindle the Trees, and then opted to leave Valinor to wrest them from the Dark Lord. He blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds and most Elves were persuaded that because the Valar had abandoned them, the [[Noldor]] must follow him to [[Middle-earth]]. He and his [[Sons of Feanor|sons]] [[Oath of Feanor|vowed]] to fight anyone and everyone—Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala—who withheld the Silmarils.<ref>{{S|8}}</ref><ref>{{S|9}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Ulmo Appears before Tuor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - '' Ulmo Appears before Tuor'']]
After the departure of the rebelling Noldor, the Valar created the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] from the last living growth of the Two Trees and appointed two Maiar to steer them through the skies. However after the Enemy attempted to destroy the Moon, the Valar fortified Valinor. The [[Nurtalë Valinóreva|Hiding of Valinor]] made it inaccessible to Morgoth, but also exiled the Noldor who followed Feanor.<ref>{{S|11}}</ref>

The Valar virtually abandoned the peoples of Middle-earth who suffered during the [[Wars of Beleriand]], although they had their ways to guide them through their sufferings: [[Ulmo]] urged [[Turgon]] and [[Finrod]] to build their hidden kingdoms and guided [[Tuor]] to [[Gondolin]] as a messenger for Turgon.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos.jpg|thumb|Ted Nasmith - ''Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos'']]
Near the end of the [[First Age]], [[Eärendil]] breached the Hiding of Valinor and went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in Middle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea. The [[Host of the Valar]], composed of Maiar and [[Amanyar]] came to [[Beleriand]] and fought the great [[War of Wrath]] and managed their final victory over the Dark Lord, who was judged again, and expelled from Arda.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> The road to Valinor opened again for the Elves, both the exiled Noldor and the [[Moriquendi]] of Middle-earth.

The [[Edain]] suffered much during the Wars and under Morgoth, and the Valar created the isle of [[Elenna]] for them, and blessed them and their descendants with wisdom, knowledge and longevity. But they imposed a ban on them to never travel westwards. Although the [[Númenóreans]] dominated the mortal lands, eventually they were restricted by the [[Ban of the Valar]] and the fear of death. They envied the Valar and the Elves of their [[immortality]], and [[King of Numenor|King]] [[Tar-Atanamir]] was the first to speak against the immortals. 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Eagles of Manwë.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Eagles of Manwë'']]Eagle-shaped storm clouds, called the "Eagles of the Lords of the West", were sent by Manwë when he tried to reason or threaten the Númenóreans. But after several generations, [[Númenor]] fell under the corrupting influence of [[Sauron]] who eventually assured King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] that if he ever reached Aman he would become immortal. He gathered a [[Great Armament|great host of ships]] and sailed to break the Ban of the Valar and wage war upon them. But Manwë was aware of what transpired, and the Valar then laid down the Guardianship of Arda. Ilúvatar responded by catastrophically changing the shape of Arda. After the destruction of [[Númenor]], the Undying Lands were removed from Arda so that Men could not reach them and only the Elves could go there by the [[Straight Road]] and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres of the earth.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

By the [[Third Age]], the Valar worried about the growing [[Shadow]] of Sauron, and they held counsel. They sent some Maiar who came to the mortal lands in the guise of old men, a part of some restrictions imposed upon them. They formed the order of the [[Wizards]] and opposed Sauron, until his demise in the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RK}}</ref>

It is said that their guardianship will grow weak and the Dark Lord will eventually escape the [[Doors of Night]]. The Valar will fight him again in the [[Dagor Dagorath]], when the world will be destroyed, but the Ainur along with Elves and Men will sing anew a Second [[Music of the Ainur]]. All the Ainur know is that the Second Music will be greater than the First Music. Even the Ainur do not know anything of the second world or the Second Music only that it will be greater than the First Music.

==Etymology, names and titles==
The word ''[[vala]]'' means "(angelic) power" and derives from the [[root]] [[BAL]], having to do with mightiness and power. The [[Primitive Quendian]] form of the word was ''bálā'', pl. ''bal-ī''.<ref name=Ety>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 350 (root appearing as "BAL-")</ref> Related words suggested authority or divinity, eg. ''vala-'' "to rule"<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, p. 404</ref>. 

The Valar were commemorated in the day-name [[Valanya]] and personal names such as [[Valandur]] or [[Valandil]]. The word is also the name of [[Tengwa]] #22.

In [[Sindarin]], they are called '''Belain''', sg. '''[[Balan]]''' as in the day-name ''[[Valanya|Orbelain]]'' and the constellation ''[[Valacirca|Cerch i Mbelain]]''. More commonly, they were called '''Rodyn''' (singular ''Rodon'') instead. 

The Valar are also called '''the Lords of Valinor'''<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> or '''númeheruvi''' "Lords-of-West" <ref>{{HM|SD}}, p.246</ref> 

In [[Adunaic]], the Valar were '''Avalôi''' (pl.) and '''Avalôim''' (subj. pl.) "Powers". The female form (equivalent to ''Valie'') was '''Avalê''' "goddess".<ref>{{HM|SD}}, pp. 241, 305, 428</ref> They had also the title '''Barîm an-Adûn''' "Lords-of-West".<ref>{{HM|SD}}, p.247</ref> 


In [[Ælfwine|Ælfwine's]] translations in [[Old English]], the Valar were called Frean "lords", Ese "gods", Bregan "rulers" and Maegen "powers".

==Relationships between the Valar==
In the mind of Eru, some Valar were siblings and others were couples. It was the Valar who first practiced marriage, and later passed on their custom to the Elves. The last marriage among the Valar (the only that took place within the world) was that of Tulkas and Nessa on Almaren. 

Ulmo and Nienna (and Melkor) were unmarried.  In the diagram below the Aratar are in '''bold''' font and the Fëanturi are in ''Italic'' font.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the Valar were more closely associated with pagan mythologies. Other than marrying, they were able to have children. [[Fionwe]] and [[Ilmare]] were first conceived as the children of Manwe and Varda and [[Gothmog]] as the son of Melko. The '''Valarindi''' ("Offspring of the Valar") were made Maiar in the later Legendarium.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/81130376337/children-of-the-valar|articlename=Children of the Valar|website=[http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com Ask About Middle-earth]}}</ref>

In those earlier conceptions, the word ''Vala'' was associated with [[Qenya]] words for happiness and blessedness, as seen in the words ''valin'' and ''valimo'' "happy". Thus the word Valar meant "Happy ones" before being reconceived as being associated with power.The Qenya female form of the Vala was ''Valde'' or ''Valis''. <ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|website=Arda}}</ref>

In the ''[[Etymologies]]'' it said that the word has no female form, and the female Valar are called ''Valatári'' or "Queen of the Valar".<ref name=Ety/> In the published ''Silmarillion'' the female form is ''Valie''.
