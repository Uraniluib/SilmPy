'''Foxes''' were [[dogs|dog]]-like carnivores of woodland and farmland, distinctive for their red-orange coats and their eerie plaintive cries. A fox became puzzled at finding [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] asleep in a [[Firs|fir-wood]] on the first night of their journey from [[Hobbiton]].<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Another fox was encountered by [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the hobbits as they hiked through the [[Chetwood]] after leaving [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

The [[Quenya]] word for "fox" is ''[[rusco]]'' ([[Sindarin]] has ''rusc'').<ref>{{PM|XI}}, p. 353</ref><ref>{{VT|41a}}, p. 10</ref>
