'''Quentalë Ardanómion''' is a work that [[Ælfwine]] states having used as a source for the text ''Concerning the Dwarves'' beside ''[[Lammas]]'' and ''[[Dorgannas Iaur]]''.<ref>{{WJ|P2}}, p. 206</ref> The work is not mentioned elsewhere, neither its writer is known.

==Etymology==
The [[Quenya]] word ''[[quentalë]]'' means 'history'.<ref>See e.g. {{VT|39a6}}, cf. ''[[Quentalë Noldorinwa]]''.</ref> ''Ardanómion'' is not quite clear apart the beginning of the word, ''[[Arda]]''. [[Måns Björkman]] considers ''-nómion'' possibly a misreading of the manuscript, because ''-nornion'' < ''[[norno]]'' 'dwarf' would make sense in a work used as a source for a text on dwarves.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Måns Björkman]]|articleurl=http://www.forodrim.org/gobennas/chron_en.html|articlename=The Chroniclers of Arda|dated=13 December 2000|website=Forod|accessed=9 March 2015}}</ref>
