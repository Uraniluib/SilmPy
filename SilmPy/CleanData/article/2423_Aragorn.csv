'''Aragorn II''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈaraɡorn]}}; 1 March [[Third Age]] {{TA|2931|n}} – [[Fourth Age]] {{FoA|120|n}}, died aged 210 years<ref>{{HM|AB}}.</ref>) was the son of [[Arathorn II]] and [[Gilraen]]. He was the last [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] and a direct descendant through many generations of [[Isildur]], the last [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of both [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. Aragorn would become the greatest [[Men|Man]] of his time, leading the [[Dúnedain|Men of the West]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces, helping to destroy [[the One Ring]], and reuniting the [[Reunited Kingdom|Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor]]. 

==History==
===Early Life===
Aragorn was born in {{TA|2931}} to the Chieftain Arathorn, and received the name Aragorn. But his grandmother, [[Ivorwen]], noted with foresight that Aragorn would one day wear on his breast a green stone.<ref>{{PM|Foreword}}</ref>

A legend says that the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] had brought [[Elfstone|such a stone]] from [[Valinor]]. He gave the Elessar to the [[Elves|Elven]] Lady [[Galadriel]], and remarked prophetically that she would pass it to another, who will also be called Elessar.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref> From this would come his royal name ''Elessar'' ([[Quenya]] for "Elfstone"), and he would be a healer and a renewer. 

When Aragorn was two years old, his father was slain when an [[Orcs|Orc]] arrow pierced his eye. As was the tradition of his people, Aragorn was fostered in [[Rivendell]] by [[Elrond]] as if he was his own son. By Elrond's order, his identity was kept secret, as he feared he would be slain like his father and grandfather. Aragorn was named '''''[[Estel]]''''' ([[Sindarin]] for "Hope") instead.  During his life in Rivendell he accompanied the sons of Elrond, [[Elrohir]] and [[Elladan]], on their journeys. <ref name="A1v">{{App|A1v}}</ref>
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Aragorn and Arwen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen Hickman]] - ''Aragorn and Arwen'']]
Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he returned from a journey with Elrohir and Elladan in {{TA|2952}}, when Aragorn was twenty-one years old; as part of this revelation, he delivered to him the heirlooms of [[House of Isildur|his House]]: the shards of [[Narsil]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]. Later, Aragorn met and fell in love with [[Arwen]], daughter of Elrond, who had newly returned from [[Lothlórien]].<ref name="A1v"/>

===Life as a Ranger===
Estel took up his proper name as Aragorn, sixteenth of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain, and after he took leave of his mother and Elrond he went into [[The Wild]].<ref name="A1v"/> In {{TA|2953}} he was not present in Rivendell for the last meeting of the [[White Council]]. Aragorn met [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] in {{TA|2956}}, and they became great friends.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> At Gandalf's advice he started to become interested in [[the Shire]] and became known as '''''Strider''''' in this region.
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Ecthelion,Thorongil and Boromir study.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Catherine Karina Chmiel]] - ''"Thorongil" with Ecthelion II'']]
From {{TA|2957}} to {{TA|2980}} Aragorn took great journeys, serving in the armies of King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] of Gondor.<ref name="TA"/> Many of his tasks weakened [[Sauron]] and his allies, which during the [[War of the Ring]] helped the West survive. His name in Gondor and Rohan was '''''Thorongil''''' (Sindarin for "Eagle of the Star"), and became one of Ecthelion II's most important advisers. He warned Ecthelion of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], who threathened the [[Southern Fiefs]] and was eventually allowed by Ecthelion to attack [[Umbar]]. He led a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|Surprise Attack on the Havens of Umbar]] with a few Gondorian ships, destroying many of their ships and slaying its lord with only few casualties. After his return in [[Pelargir]], he crossed the [[Anduin]] and left Gondor to travel into the far East and South "exploring the hearts of men good and evil" and learning about the "plots and devices" of the servants of the Dark Lord.<ref>{{App|A1ivS}}</ref>

Later in 2980 on his return to Rivendell he entered [[Lothlórien]], and there once again met Arwen in [[Caras Galadhon]]. For one season they wandered together in Lothlórien. At midsummer he gave her the heirloom of his House, the [[Ring of Barahir]], and Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage.<ref name="A1v"/>

Elrond gave his foster-son permission to marry his daughter, on the condition that he must first become king of both Gondor and Arnor, for only a king would be worthy of Arwen's hand. This harsh condition had a precedent: King [[Thingol]]'s request that [[Beren]] obtain a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from [[Morgoth]] before marrying his daughter [[Lúthien]].<ref name="A1v"/>

===Hunt for Gollum===
In the year [[Third Age 3001|3001]], as a now revealed [[Sauron]] continued to regain power in [[Mordor]], Aragorn began assisting [[Gandalf]] in his search for  news of [[Gollum]]. Gandalf suspected that the ring [[Bilbo Baggins]] found near Gollum's lake was in fact [[the One Ring]]. In {{TA|3007}}, he briefly returned to [[Eriador]] where he visited his mother for the last time, she died before that year's spring. 

In [[Third Age 3017|3017]] after searching intermittently over the years,<ref name="TA"/> Aragorn finally overtook Gollum in the [[Dead Marshes]] on [[1 February]]. With Gollum he travelled through the northern [[Emyn Muil]], to prevent being found by Sauron's spies, and crossed the Anduin at the [[Sarn Gebir]]. He travelled further north along the edges of [[Fangorn Forest]] and through Lothlórien,<ref name="UT">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> where the Elves sent a message to Gandalf.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, Note 5</ref> He travelled alongside the Anduin to the north until he arrived at the [[Carrock]]. With the aid of the [[Beornings]] he crossed the Anduin with Gollum and entered [[Mirkwood]]. He took Gollum to [[Thranduil]] to be held captive.<ref name="UT"/> He then returned west where he met with Gandalf at [[Sarn Ford]] and learned of [[Frodo Baggins]]' plan to leave the shire with the Ring in late September. Aragorn then continued his own journey.<ref name="Strider">{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
When Aragorn returned to his area, the [[Elves]] who followed [[Gildor Inglorion]] told Aragorn the Black Riders had been seen, and Gandalf had been missing and there were no messages from him. Aragorn and his [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] kept watch over the border of [[the Shire]] and the [[East Road]] waiting for sight of Frodo but there were no news of them leaving [[Buckland]].<ref name="Strider"/>

While staying in [[Bree]], Aragorn crossed the paths of four hobbits in [[The Prancing Pony]].  Aragorn watched as the hobbits clumsily hid their names and intentions. He watched as [[Frodo Baggins]], the leader of the party, fell from a table and disappeared as he put the ring on.  Aragorn, whose name was given as Strider, seemed to show no surprise, only annoyance at Frodo’s foolish vanishing act.  He arranged for an interview that night, where he warned them of the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and [[Bill Ferny]], then bluntly requested that they use him as a guide.  After some consideration, and a note given them by the forgetful [[Barliman Butterbur]] from Gandalf condoning him, Frodo agreed.
[[File:Jef Murray - Amon Sûl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jef Murray]] - ''Amon Sûl'']]
Aragorn’s plan to reach Rivendell was to first head  toward [[Archet]] and bear right to [[Weathertop]].  After the ambush at Weathertop and the wounding of Frodo, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] took over the position as leader of the Hobbits.  After a while they met [[Glorfindel]], a friend of Aragorn’s, and it was not much later that they arrived in Rivendell.
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Reforging of the Sword.jpg|thumb|[[Darrell Sweet]] - ''The Reforging of the Sword'']]
After the Council of Elrond Aragorn became a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. As a preparation for his travel, the ancient shards of [[Narsil]], the heirloom of his House, were reforged after 3 millennia. Aragorn carried the Sword Reforged, and renamed it [[Andúril]]. 

Aragorn's intentions were to travel with the company for a while before returning to [[Gondor]] with [[Boromir]]. Aragorn encouraged the taking of the [[Caradhras|Redhorn Pass]], which ended in disaster. He reluctantly conceded to Gandalf’s choice to pass through [[Moria]], though his sense of foresight warned him for Gandalf.  Indeed, after Gandalf fell into the  abyss with [[Durin's Bane]], Aragorn was naturally elected leader of the company, despite some resentment by Boromir.
====Leading the Fellowship of the Ring====
Aragorn again amazed the rest of the Fellowship by his apparent closeness to the people of [[Lothlórien]], and his friendship with [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. At their departure, Galadriel offered him the [[Elfstone]] as a wedding gift from the family of the Elven bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref> It was worn by Aragorn ever after and from that he later took the name '''Elessar'''.

Even at the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]] he was undecided, leaving it to Frodo for the final decision.  For though it was obvious he wished to go to [[Minas Tirith]] with Boromir, he yet felt that it was his duty to go where the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] chose.

[[File:Inger Edelfeldt - Death of Boromir.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Inger Edelfeldt]] - ''Death of Boromir'']]
After Frodo escaped him and Boromir perished, he with the remaining members of the Fellowship, namely [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], chose to try and save [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] from the [[Uruk-hai]] that had ambushed them, forming the group that would later be known as the [[Three Hunters]].

He met [[Éomer]] in the fields of [[Rohan]], and an instant friendship formed, both feeling the honesty and lordliness of the other.  Éomer took a risk for his sake, giving him horses, with the promise that one day soon Aragorn would return to [[Edoras]].  Aragorn, tracking the Hobbits, followed into Fangorn Forest, where he met the resurrected [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]].  After the restoration of [[Théoden]], he rode to [[Helm's Deep]] to fight in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].  There he, alongside his new-found “brother” Éomer, and King Théoden, marshaled the defense against [[Saruman]]’s army.  His revealed majesty upon the battlements of the Hornburg as he waited for the dawn caused some of the [[Dunlendings|Wild men]] to pause and shudder, and he heralded the return of Gandalf with [[Erkenbrand]].

After Pippin’s terrifying experience with the [[Orthanc-stone]], Gandalf presented it in a formal manner to Aragorn, its rightful master, who hinted that it would be used by him eventually. After the departure of Gandalf and Pippin to Minas Tirith, he rode for a while longer with Théoden, meeting up with his friend [[Halbarad]] of the North, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], and a company of staunch and fearless Rangers. Elladan and Elrohir gave him a message from Elrond: "''The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the [[Paths of the Dead]]''". Halbarad bore a gift from the Lady Arwen – the [[Standard of Elendil]]. Aragorn knew the path set before him.

====Return of the King====
A little while later Aragorn took his companions and his rangers and set out for [[Dunharrow]], departing from the King’s company. His course was clear: to take the Paths of the Dead, to summon the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]].  In Dunharrow, he met the lady [[Éowyn]], who had fallen in love with him.  After making it clear that he could not accept her love, he turned towards the evil road with the dawn.

The [[Grey Company]] passed through the [[Dark Door]] and the [[Dwimorberg]], the Dead following, and coming at last to the [[Stone of Erech]], Aragorn summoned them to his aid. They drew their swords and blew their horns in answer, and swept down upon the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] at [[Pelargir]] drove the mariners away. Aragorn released them, and took the [[Black Ships]] north to Minas Tirith, where the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] raged. The Standard of Elendil broke forth, and his Dúnedain swept down, giving the final blow to the army of [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. The counter-attacked army of [[Sauron]] crumbled utterly. But Aragorn did not enter the city.

Aragorn, furling his banner, appointed [[Imrahil]] the temporary lord of the City, as the law demanded.  Eventually, however, Aragorn did come to the [[Houses of Healing]], where he tended and restored Merry, Éowyn, and [[Faramir]], in accordance with the prophecy “''The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known''”. Aragorn then left the city, hooded and cloaked, and yet the people of Minas Tirith followed him, for they had heard rumours. Yet when in the morning they saw the banner of [[Dol Amroth]], they wondered if the Return of the King had been but a dream.

Aragorn held [[Last Debate|council]] with his trusted companions, namely Gandalf, Éomer, Imrahil, and Elrond’s sons – Halbarad had fallen in battle.  He agreed to draw forth the forces of [[Mordor]] for the benefit of the [[Quest of the Ring]], and so arranged matters for the [[Battle of the Morannon]].  After the destruction of the Ring in [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] and victory at the [[Morannon]], Aragorn returned at last in the triumphant manner that befitted his position. He was crowned at the gates of Minas Tirith, winning the hearts of the people of [[Gondor]].

===Reign as Elessar===
Aragorn ruled the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of Gondor and Arnor until year 120 of the [[Fourth Age]]. 

Some days after his coronation, Gandalf took Elessar up the slopes of Mount [[Mindolluin]], and there he found the scion of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], the symbol of his mastery of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Elrond and Arwen came to Gondor and Elrond gave Elessar the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] signifying the Kingship of Arnor. He wedded Arwen on Midsummer's day of 3019, and then was forced to bid his old friends farewell.  He turned back to his new kingdom as the [[Fourth Age]] dawned and the Ringbearers left the shores of Middle-earth forever.

One of his first tasks in the re-ordering of his realm was the restoration of [[Orthanc]] and ordered the [[Orthanc-stone]] to be returned there. With this opportunity, many secrets and hoarded treasures were revealed including the [[Elendilmir]] which Saruman took from Isildur's body. Elessar received the Elemdilmir with reverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of [[Arnor]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Elessar gave his [[Steward]] Faramir the title [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]] and created him as [[Prince of Ithilien]]<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>. He declared the [[Drúadan Forest]] to belong to the [[Drúedain]] and a protected enclave of his Kingdom.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> He also re-established the Great [[Council of Gondor]] whose chief councellor was the Steward<ref>{{L|244}}</ref>. He also renewed the [[Oath of Cirion]] with Éomer.

As for [[the Shire]], he declared it a Free Land under the protection of the Northern Sceptre and forbid Men from entering it. He appointed the [[Thain]], the [[Master of Buckland]], and the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] Counsellors of the North-kingdom. Also he offered to the Shire the [[Westmarch|lands]] up to the [[Tower Hills|Emyn Beraid]].<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

He founded the royal [[House of Telcontar]], he had a son and a number of daughters.

King Elessar died after 210 years of life and 122 years of rule and was succeeded by his son [[Eldarion]]. His wife Arwen, now mortal, gave up her life shortly afterwards in year 121, aged 2,901.

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Aragorn Elessar.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name '''''Aragorn''''' is [[Sindarin]], meaning '''"Revered King"''', from ''[[aran]]'' ("king") and ''[[gorn|(n)gorn]]'' ("dreaded, revered").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 113</ref>

This clear etymology from Tolkien was not revealed until the publication in 2007 of "Words, Phrases & Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings''", a late 1950s manuscript. Before that, several theories were proposed:
*[[Ruth S. Noel]] and several others proposed  "King of the Tree",<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', p. 114</ref> but Tolkien specifically said that this was not the case.<ref>{{L|347}}</ref> 
*[[David Salo]] deduces "Having Kingly Valor"<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[[A Gateway to Sindarin]]'', p. 341</ref> from Tolkien's cryptic "'Kingly Valour' (for so is that name interpreted)".<ref>{{PM|Foreword}}, p. xii</ref> This is still the most often cited etymology; Robert Ireland's ''[[A Tolkien Dictionary]]'' gives the variation "Royal Zeal".<ref>Robert Ireland, ''[[A Tolkien Dictionary]]'', [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/LOTR/LOTR_AC.html The Lord of the Rings A-C].</ref>
*[[Carl F. Hostetter]] proposed the meanings "King of the Globe" or "King of the Hill" in his analysis of the [[King's Letter]].<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], "The 'King's Letter': An Historical and Comparative Analysis", [[Vinyar Tengwar 31|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 31]], p. 18</ref>

The [[Quenya]] form of ''Aragorn'' was '''''Aracorno'''''.<ref name="WP">{{PE|17}}, p. 71</ref> 

===Names and titles===
* '''Aragorn II''' - Aragorn's name as [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]. He was likely named after [[Aragorn I]].
* [[Thorongil]] - [[Sindarin|S]] "Eagle of the Star", a pseudonym used in [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]].  Pronounced {{IPA|[θoˈroŋɡil]}}.
* '''Elessar''' - [[Quenya|Q]] "Elfstone", Aragorn's name as a king. Despite popular use as such, Aragorn was never known as "Aragorn Elessar", "Aragorn II Elessar" or "[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|King Aragorn]]".  Pronounced {{IPA|[eˈlesːar]}}.
* '''Edhelharn''' - The [[Sindarin]] equivalent of Elessar, used in the King's Letter.<ref>{{SD|XI2}}, p. 128ff</ref>  Pronounced {{IPA|[eˈðel.harn]}}.
* [[Elfstone]] - The [[Westron|Common Speech]] version of the previous two. 
* [[Envinyatar|''Envinyatar'', the Renewer]]
* [[Estel]] - [[Quenya|Q]].  Usually glossed as "Hope", the concept ''estel'' more widely means "hope, trust, a temper of mind, steady fixed in purpose, and difficult to dissuade and unlikely to fall into despair or abandon its purpose".  Pronounced {{IPA|[ˈestel]}}.
* [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] - A sobriquet given by the men of [[Bree]]. Aragorn used it mockingly.
* '''Wingfoot''' - An honorary name given by [[Éomer]] after the pursuit of the [[Uruk-hai]] through the [[Eastemnet]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>
* [[Telcontar]] - A [[Quenya]] form of "Strider", this was the name of Elessar's Royal House. It was not used independently.  Pronounced {{IPA|[telˈkontar]}}.
* [[Heir of Isildur|Isildur's Heir]] - A poetic address, as he was the heir of [[Isildur]]. 
* '''The Dúnadan''' - "[[Dúnedain|Man of the West]]", a name given by [[Bilbo Baggins]] when their friendship evolved. 
* '''Longshanks''' - another, though less frequently used, sobriquet in Bree, ascribed to [[Bill Ferny]]. The legs of the [[Bree-landers|Bree-men]] were shorter than the legs of the [[Dúnedain]].
* '''Arakorno''' - A rare Quenya form of Aragorn, which only appeared in a discussion about the words for Quenya "and".<ref name="WP"/> Pronounced {{IPA|[ˌaraˈkorno]}}.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest unpublished versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''), the character that later became Aragorn was called '''''[[Trotter]]''''' instead of Strider, and was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] instead of a [[Men|Man]]. He had wooden feet, because he had once traveled to Mordor and been tortured there.
