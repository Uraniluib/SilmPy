'''Michel Delving''' was the chief town of [[the Shire]].  It was located in the [[White Downs]] that lay within the [[Westfarthing]] on the [[East Road]], perhaps south to its smaller counterpart, the [[Little Delving]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  Although located within a hilly region the town had many above-ground houses of wood, brick, or stone. 

This large town was unofficially considered to be more or less the Hobbits' "capital".<ref name=Hobbits>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  The [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (or of the Shire) was the only real official in the Shire, under whom were attached the offices of [[Postmaster]] and [[First Shirriff]] for the entire region.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>  

The [[Town Hole]]<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>, the museum known as the [[Mathom-house]]<ref name=Hobbits/>, as well as the storage tunnels later known as [[Lockholes]]<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>, could be found in Michel Delving.

On [[4 November]] {{TA|3019}} [[Frodo Baggins]] rode to Michel Delving and released the prisoners from the Lockholes.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Its name means simply "Large Excavation", being derived from a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Micel Delfing''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>. 

''Michel'' and ''mickle-'' (cf. [[Mickleburg]]) are derived from the [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:micel|micel]]'', words meaning "much" or "large".

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Hobbits are able to quick travel to Michel Delving if they have earned the trait, have it equipped and have one travel ration.
