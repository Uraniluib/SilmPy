'''Morwë''' was one of the leaders of the [[Avari]], along with [[Nurwë]], those of the [[Elves]] who refused the summons of [[Oromë]]. Instead of opting to travel to [[Aman]], they remained at [[Cuiviénen]] with half of the [[Tatyar]] (the second clan who later became known as the [[Noldor]]) and a third of the [[Nelyar]] (the third clan, later known as the [[Teleri]]).<ref>{{AA}}</ref>
