The '''Lithedays''' or just '''The Lithe''' refers to the three (sometimes four) feast days between the months of [[Forelithe]] and [[Afterlithe]] of the [[Shire Calendar]]; in purpose and function the Lithedays were equivalent to the ''[[enderi]]'' of the [[Reckoning of Rivendell]]. 

They were:
*1 Lithe (midsummer-eve)
*[[Mid-year's Day]] 
**[[Overlithe]] (observed only in leap-years)
*2 Lithe
They were called [[Summerdays]] in [[Bree]].<ref>{{App|Shire}}</ref>

Events that occurred on 1 Lithe:

* {{TA|2941}}:
** [[Elrond]] discovers the [[moon-letters]] on [[Thrór's Map]].
* {{TA|3019}}:
**[[Arwen]] comes to [[Minas Tirith]].

Each midsummer-eve the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]] held parties, where [[Gandalf]] impressed the [[hobbits]] with fireworks.<ref>{{H|6}}</ref>
