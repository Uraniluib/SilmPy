<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The air was neither night or a day, 
But faintly dark with softest light 
When first glimmered into sight 
The Cottage of Lost Play 

You and me - we know that land 
And often have been there in 
The old days, old days 
The dark child and a fair 
Was it down the paths of firelight 
Dreams in winter cold and white, 
Or in the blue-spun twilight, twilight hours 
The air was neither night or day, 
But faintly dark with softest light, 
When first there glimmered into sight 
The Cottage of Lost Play 

And why we never found the same 
Old cottage, or magic 
Track that leads between a silver sea, 
Between a silver sea 
And those old shores and gardens fair 
Where all things are that ever were - 
We know not, You and Me 
We know not, You and Me 

Those old shores and gardens fair 
Where all things are 
That ever were 

The air was neither night or day, 
But faintly dark with softest light, 
When first there glimmered into sight 
The Cottage of Lost Play 
And those old shores and gardens 
Where all things are that ever were 
We know not, You and Me, 
We know not, You and Me 

And these old shores 
And gardens fair 
Where all things are 
That ever were [before] 
Air was neither night or day 
But faintly dark with softest light 
When first there glimmered 
The Cottage of Lost Play
