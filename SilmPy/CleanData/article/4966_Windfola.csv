'''Windfola''' was a grey horse of the [[Rohirrim]].

Windfola was the horse that carried [[Éowyn]] (in the guise of [[Dernhelm]]) the long miles from [[Dunharrow]] to the [[Pelennor Fields]], secretly accompanied by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref> Windfola was in the charge of the [[Rohirrim]] in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], but at the onset of the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]], the horse went mad with fear, threw his riders, and fled in panic. Left behind by their steed, Éowyn and Merry brought down the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], but by then Windfola had left them far behind him on the battlefield.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
