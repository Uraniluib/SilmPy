'''Erui''' was a river in [[Gondor]]. This swift-flowing<ref name="Beacon"/> river began near [[Mindolluin]] in the [[White Mountains]], flowing south through the province of [[Lossarnach]], where it met the [[Anduin]] about 75 miles south of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="Map">{{RK|Map}}</ref> Of old, it was part of the border between [[An√≥rien]] and [[Lebennin]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 509</ref>

The main road from [[Minas Tirith]] to [[Pelargir]] crossed the Erui at the [[Crossings of Erui]].<ref name="Map"/>

==Etymology==
''Erui'' is a variant of ''[[ereb]]'', which means "single, alone", but with the adjectival ending ''[[-ui]]''. It was so named because it was the shortest river, and the only one without a tributary.<ref name="Beacon">{{VT|42a}}, p. 10</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the "working map" that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used while writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' this river had the name ''Ereg''.<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, West, p. 434</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Erui was located in Eastern Gondor and was the easternmost of the [[Five Rivers of Lebennin]]. It flowed through [[Imloth Melui]] and divided Upper [[Lebennin]] and [[Lossarnach]]. The Erui was the domain of the brooding River-maid known as the Lone Lady, one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the end of the [[Third Age]]. The Lone Lady had long been detached and troubled due to the blood spilled in her waters during the [[Kin-strife]], and the invasion by [[Haradrim]] during the [[War of the Ring]] enraged her. She commanded the waters of the Erui to animate the armour of long-dead soldiers of Gondor to drive away any who approached the [[Crossings of Erui|Crossings]]. She was calmed by her sisters, but not before raising the armour of [[Castamir]] himself from the riverbed.
