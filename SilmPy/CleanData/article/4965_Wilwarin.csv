'''Wilwarin''' was one of the [[constellations]] of [[Arda]].

Wilwarin was created by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Varda]]. It was set in the heavens of [[Arda]] to welcome and give light to the [[Elves]], who were just waking in [[Cuiviénen]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor]]"</ref>

==Etymology==
''Wilwarin'' (''wilwarind-'', pl. ''wilwarindi'') means "[[butterflies|butterfly]]" in [[Quenya]].<ref name="etym-wil">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', "[[The Etymologies]]", entry ''WIL-'', pp. 398-9</ref>

''Wilwarin'' comes from the same root (''wil-'', "fly, float in air") as the name for the Ring of Air, ''[[Vilya]]'', and shares this common root with the Sindarin word ''[[gwilith]]'', "air".<ref name="etym-wil"/>

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] gave no description of the constellation, nor any counterpart in our modern-day constellations, but [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that it could be the commonly-known constellation [[Wikipedia:Cassiopeia_(constellation)|Cassiopeia]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "Index of Names"</ref> Cassiopeia is a plausible candidate for being Wilwarin as its "W"-shape is a reasonable match to that of a butterfly.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s notes, the name of the constellation is "Vilvarin".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', "The Later [[Quenta Silmarillion]]", pp. 160, 166</ref>

From other published writings, we know of a few other forms of the word ''wilwarin''. The words ''wilwarindëa'' and ''wilwarindië'' (older [[Qenya]] form was ''wilwarindeën''<ref name="matc">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'', "A Secret Vice", pp. 213, 216, 220</ref>) are the respective singular and plural forms meaning "like a ''wilwarin'' or butterfly".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Early Elvish Poetry" in [[Christopher Gilson]] (ed.), ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'', [[Parma Eldalamberon 16|vol. 16]], 2006, p. 96</ref> We also know of the Qenya form ''wilwarindon'', "as a butterfly".<ref name="matc"/>
