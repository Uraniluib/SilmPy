'''Alfirin''' was an [[Elvish]] name for the flower [[Men]] called [[simbelmynë]] (they also used the name [[uilos]] for the same flower).<ref name="Note38">{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 38</ref> The name comes from its habit of growing thickly on the tombs of [[Men]]: it was found among the Kings' mounds in the [[Barrowfield]] of [[Edoras]], and also on the [[Tomb of Elendil]].  Tolkien provided a description of "an immortelle, but not dry and papery: simply a beautiful bell-like flower, running through many colours, but soft and gentle."<ref>{{L|312}}</ref>  The white variety seems to have been most common.
==Etymology==
''Alfirin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, said to mean "not dying". While first said to consist of ''[[alph]]'' ("[[Swans|swan]]") + ''irin'' (unglossed), [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] amended the compound to consist of ''al-'' ("not") + ''fĭrin'' ("mortal"; see also [[Quenya]] ''[[firin]]'').<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 100-1</ref>

==Other versions==

In his comments in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] points out that [[Legolas]]' description of "golden bells ... of ''mallos'' and ''alfirin''", is not quite in harmony with other descriptions, and he suggests that this particular use of the name  may refer to a different flower altogether.<ref name="Note38"/>
<ref group=note>In addition to Christopher Tolkien's comment, J.R.R. Tolkien himself occurs to list  ''alfirin'' (and ''mallos'') separately from the ''symbelmynë'' in {{L|187}} – thus perhaps implicitly implying a different nature.</ref> Alternatively, the golden flowers of [[Lebennin]] might simply be a differently-coloured variety of the white ''alfirin'' commonly seen on Men's tombs.<ref group=note>The Elvish name and Tolkien's comparison with an "immortelle" may remind the Amaranth, of similar etymological meaning (from Old Greek ''ἀμάρανθος'', "not withering"). The Amaranth was known for not withering (see for instance Pliny's ''Natural History'') and was also associated with the Underworld and the Elysian Fields (see for instance John Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', III, 353). Legolas' song mentioning the golden ''alfirin'' evokes the fields of Lebennin devastated by war, as found by the characters just after leaving the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Alain Lefèvre studied these possible connections in "Asphodèles et amarantes — Champs élyséens de ''mallos'' et d'''alfirin''" (French), in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'', vol. 1, 2011, pp. 63-84.</ref>
