The '''Firth of Rómenna''' was a small body of water that had a narrow eastern opening into the [[Bay of Rómenna]] on the eastern side of [[Númenor]].  Its northern shore bordered [[Orrostar]] while its western end and southern shore bordered [[Arandor]].  The firth was the location for the city of [[Rómenna]], the chief port of Númenor.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref>

The young Prince [[Aldarion]] spent all the time that he could at his grandfather [[Vëantur]]'s house, which was on the south side of the firth.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

In the later days of Númenor, the [[Faithful]] were compelled to live in Rómenna by [[Ar-Gimilzôr]].  In the time of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] this constraint turned out to be a blessing, for the nine ships of [[Elendil]] that lay in the firth were protected from the first effects of the downfall of the island and were able to escape to the shores of [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
