The '''Stone of the Hapless''' was the hallowed stone on the banks of the River [[Taeglin]] that commemorated [[Túrin]] and [[Nienor]],<ref>{{S|21}}</ref> and [[Morwen]] their mother.

==Fate==
Later, during the drowning of [[Beleriand]], the site of the Stone of the Hapless did not drown (as predicted by [[Glirhuin]]), but remained as an island, [[Tol Morwen]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The stone had two other names: the Standing Stone, and Talbor.<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, "[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]" (see especially Notes 15 and 55)</ref> Talbor is [[Taliska|Taliskan]] and the latter part of the word, ''[[bor (Taliska)|bor]]'', means 'stone'.
