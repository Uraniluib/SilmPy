}}'''Nimrodel''' was an [[Elves|Elf]]-maid of [[Lothlórien]], beloved of [[Amroth]].  She travelled into the southern lands of [[Middle-earth]] and became lost in the [[White Mountains]] about {{TA|1981}}.

==History==
Nimrodel had lived in Lothlórien since well before the [[Sindar]] and [[Noldor]] came. She was unhappy with the newcomers, as she thought they would bring the turmoils of [[Middle-earth]] to the golden forest. She lived separately near [[Nimrodel (river)|the river that would later bear her name]], and spoke only her native tongue.

The only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda [[Amroth]], the King of the wood. She loved him, and he her, but refused to marry him. After the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] awoke in nearby [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] in {{TA|1980}}, Nimrodel grew even uneasier in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], but could not enter it.

Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they would travel to [[Edhellond]], the port city in [[Belfalas]], and thence set sail to the [[Undying Lands]]. They were accompanied by a small staff of [[Silvan Elves]], including [[Mithrellas]]. All went well until they reached the [[White Mountains]]. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship.

When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by [[Belegaer]]'s strong currents and drowned.

Nimrodel, in the meantime, had settled for a while at the river [[Gilrain]], which reminded her of her home. She sat by the starlit stream and fell in a long deep sleep. After she woke, she journeyed further, but found no ship in [[Edhellond]], and Amroth was long gone. Whatever she did after was lost to time.

==Etymology==
Nimrodel means "Lady of the White Grotto".<ref name="UT">{{UT|Index}}</ref>
