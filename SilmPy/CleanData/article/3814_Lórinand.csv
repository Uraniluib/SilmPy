{{main|Lothlórien}}
'''Lórinand''' was one of the many old names for the land usually called [[Lothlórien]].
==Etymology==
In a manuscript composed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] sometime after ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''Lórinand'' is said to be a [[Nandorin]] name, meaning "valley of gold" (containing the "Elvish word meaning 'golden light'").<ref name=UTG>{{UT|Galadriel}}, note 5</ref>

However, [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that in a later manuscript the name ''Lórinand'' was reconceptualized as "a transformation, after the introduction of the [[Mallorn|mallorns]], of a yet older name ''[[Lothlórien#Names|Lindórinand]]''".<ref name=UTG/>
