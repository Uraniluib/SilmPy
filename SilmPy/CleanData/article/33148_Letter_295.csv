==Summary==
Tolkien had contributed a poem in Anglo-Saxon to the journal ''Shenandoah'' as part of a [[Wikipedia:festschrift|festschrift]] for [[W.H. Auden|Auden's]] sixtieth birthday.  Auden praised this poem and Tolkien's "[[The Sea-Bell]]" ("[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo’s]] Dreme").  Tolkien was delighted by Auden's letter and greatly cheered by Auden's pleasure and praise for the two poems.  He also thanked Auden for his effort on ''The Song of the Sibyl''<ref group="note">Auden and Paul B. Taylor translated the Völuspá or "Song of the Sibyl" and included it in ''The Elder Edda: A Selection'' in 1969.</ref> and hoped to send Auden his attempt to unify the lays about the Völsungs that he did many years before.
