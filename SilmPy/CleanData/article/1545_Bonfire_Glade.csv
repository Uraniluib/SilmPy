'''Bonfire Glade''' was a reminder of the strange 'war' that took place between the malevolent trees of the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Hobbits]] of [[Buckland]], sometime between {{TA|2340}} and {{TA|3018}}. 

The trees attacked the [[High Hay|Hedge]] that protected the [[Bucklanders]], and in retaliation, the [[Hobbits]] invaded the forest and burnt hundreds of trees in a huge bonfire. The Bonfire Glade was the place of that great burning, and even after many years, the trees left it an open and empty place.  

[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] led [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to the glade and out the other side on a path leading into the heart of the Old Forest.<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>
