'''Folcwine''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2830|n}} – {{TA|2903|n}}, aged 73 years) was the fourteenth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Folcwine was the son of [[Folca]] "The Hunter", and great-grandfather of [[Théoden]]. Aided by [[Gondor]], he drove out [[Dunlendings]] who occupied the area between [[Adorn]] and [[Isen]] and recovered that area.

In {{TA|2885}} he also fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and sent his twin eldest sons, [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] to aid Gondor in the war with [[Harad]]. However they were both killed, and Folcwine was succeeded by his youngest child, [[Fengel]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Folcwine'' means "folk-friend" in [[Old English]].
