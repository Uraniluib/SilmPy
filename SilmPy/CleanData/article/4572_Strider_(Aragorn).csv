'''Strider''', or '''Stick-at-naught Strider''', was a nickname given to [[Aragorn]] by the people of [[Eriador]] (as for example at [[Bree]]) during his time as a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. 

The name seems to refer to the long legs of the Rangers, who were of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood, compared to the shorter-legged [[Bree-landers|Bree-men]]. 

Though Aragorn considered the name scornful, he took it as the name of his royal house: translated into [[Quenya]] as [[Telcontar]].

Leaving [[Minas Tirith]], [[Frodo Baggins]] jokingly named his [[pony]] "[[Strider (pony)|Strider]]" in order to honor his former companion.
