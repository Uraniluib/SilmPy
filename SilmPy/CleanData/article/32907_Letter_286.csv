==Summary==
There were no "Gods" in his mythology, stated Tolkien.  Instead there were the [[Valar]] or Powers: angelic created beings appointed to govern the world.  The Elves naturally believed in them since they had lived with them.  Explaining all this would hinder Tolkien's work to publish it in proper form.
==Note==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] pointed out that this was an example of the short replies that Tolkien made to readers in this period of his life.  In the years immediately after the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the replies had been much longer.
