==Excerpt==

"... I have recently been ill and, in fact, only returned from a long convalescence ... I am afraid I cannot help you in the matter of children’s books, one, because after a long absence my own affairs take all of my present limited strength, and secondly, because I have never been a lover of books for children and have seldom read any since my childhood. [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] is our great expert on this topic (a former pupil and friend of both [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]] and myself) ..."
