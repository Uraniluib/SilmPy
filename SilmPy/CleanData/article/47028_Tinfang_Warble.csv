'''Tinfang''', whom the children call '''[[Tinfang Warble]]''', is a creature mentioned in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and in the poem ''[[Tinfang Warble (poem)|Tinfang Warble]]''.

[[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] tells to [[Eriol]] about Tinfang Warble, a [[spirit]] who is half [[fay]] of [[Palúrien]] and half [[Elf]] ([[Gnome]] or [[Solosimpi]]). He was a flautist whose fluting had an enchantment, and the stars twinkled according to his notes. Not even the [[Solosimpi]] could rival his fluting.

He led the Elves forth with his piping, and could be heard in the [[Great Lands]] and sometimes also in [[Alalminórë]]. Eriol also heard him.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 94 ff</ref>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
'''Tinfang Gelion''' is mentioned in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' as being one of the greatest of the minstrels of the [[Elves]], beside [[Maglor]] and next to [[Daeron]].<ref>{{LB|C3}}, p. 174</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Tinfang'' is "star-beard" (from ''[[tinu]]'' "spark, little star" + ''[[fang]]'' "beard"; found in [[The Etymologies]] of ''[[The Lost Road]]'').{{fact}} He apparently was one of those few elves who grew beards during the first age of their life, like [[Mahtan]].{{fact}}

''[[Gelion]]'' can also be found in several other compounds.

== Inspiration ==
His name probably comes from an earlier poem Tolkien penned named ''[[Tinfang Warble (poem)]]'', about a fairy-bird.{{fact}}<!--Speculation-->
