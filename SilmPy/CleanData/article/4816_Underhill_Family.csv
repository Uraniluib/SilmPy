{{disambig-more|Underhill|[[Underhill (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Underhill''' was a common family name amongst [[Hobbits]].  The Underhill Family had branches in [[the Shire]] and in [[Bree]]. In particular, there was a family of [[Bree-hobbits]] who lived in [[Staddle]] (on the east side of [[Bree-hill]]) who had that name.

When [[Frodo Baggins]] made the decision to leave the Shire with [[the One Ring|the Ring]], [[Gandalf]] said that he must leave the name of "Baggins" behind and gave him the travelling name of "Underhill".<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>  This was perhaps not the best choice, for when "Mr. Underhill" arrived in Bree, there were several Underhills in the common-room at [[the Prancing Pony]] and they thought it likely that Frodo was some long-lost cousin of theirs.  One of the [[Bree-landers]], who seemed familiar with the Shire, asked where the Underhills lived and who were their relations.<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

When the [[Ruffians]] came north up the [[Greenway]] some of them took to thievery and mischief in Bree.  During a fight within the town one of the Underhills from Staddle was killed.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>
