The '''Sea of Rhûn''' was a large lake or sea in northern [[Middle-earth]] that lay east of [[Rhovanion]] on the western borders of [[Rhûn]]. The [[Kine of Araw]] were found in the fields of Rhûn near the Inland Sea.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref><ref>{{App|South}}</ref>

==Geography==
The Sea of Rhûn covered roughly 400 square miles (1,000 km&sup2;). The [[River Running|Celduin]] flowed from the north-west into an arm of the sea. West of the Sea of Rhûn was the land of [[Dorwinion]], and roughly 200 miles (300 km) to the south was the eastern end of the [[Ered Lithui]].

A forest stood at the north-eastern shore of the sea, and near the south-western shore there were many hills. The south-eastern part of the Sea was occupied by a small wooded island.

==History==
In the [[Years of the Trees]] during the time of the [[Great Journey]], the craft of ship-making practised by the [[Teleri]] reached new heights in their efforts to traverse the Sea of Rhûn on their westward journey.<ref name=Last>{{PM|Last}} pp. 391-392</ref>

In the [[First Age]], the shores of the Inland Sea were populated by tribes of [[Men]] who were migrating to the [[West]]. The [[House of Bëor|Lesser Folk]] arrived there first and dwelt at the feet of the nearby hills. The [[House of Hador|Greater Folk]] came later in the north-east woods near the shores. The Men crafted boats and could sail the sea, but they did not meet often, and their languages soon diverged<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref> before they resumed their journey to [[Beleriand]].

In the early [[Third Age]], the [[Kings of Gondor]] such as [[Rómendacil I]] campaigned to those lands, and [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar]] expanded the kingdom to the East. By the time of King [[Hyarmendacil I]], the Inland Sea formed one of the boundaries of [[Gondor]].<ref name=gondor/>

[[Vorondil]] hunted the Kine of Araw near the shores of the Sea.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

During the time of [[Rómendacil II]], the Inland Sea was apparently within the borders of the power of [[Gondor]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the drafts for the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', the sea was called "Sea of Rhûnaer". In the earlier maps, part of the Sea was occupied by a heavily wooded island.<ref>{{TI|MII}}</ref> In the published maps by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the island is replaced by a dotted pattern.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> The reason for this change and what it signifies was never specified by C. Tolkien. There is no trace of the unnamed island in [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''.

Also in these early maps, Tolkien indicated that ''[[Neldoreth]]'' was the name of the forest bordering the Sea of Rhûn's north-eastern shore. This forest went unnamed in later maps.<ref>{{TI|MII}}, p. 307</ref>

==Theories==
Christopher Tolkien and others have speculated whether or not the Sea of Rhûn can "...be identified with the [[Sea of Helcar]], vastly shrunken".<ref>{{WJ|Two}} p. 174.</ref> [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] adopted this position in making ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''. However, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', there are references to the Sea of Rhûn and its surrounding geographical landmarks existing as far back as the [[Years of the Trees]] at the time of the [[Great Journey]], far to the west of where the Elves awoke near Sea of Helcar.<ref name=Last/>
