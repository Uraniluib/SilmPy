The "'''Clarendon Chaucer'''" was the working title of an edition by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s works for the Clarendon Press, which never was completed (a manuscript suggests that '''''Selections from Chaucer's Poetry and Prose''''' might have been intended as the published title). While at the [[University of Leeds]], Tolkien worked with [[E.V. Gordon]] on the edition, under the supervision of [[Kenneth Sisam]].<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 153-6</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have noted that the existence of the "Clarendon Chaucer" was largely unknown before the publication of their ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'' ([[2006]]).<ref>[[Pieter Collier]], "[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/Wayne_Hammond_Christina_Scull_Interview.php Interview with Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull - authors of the J.R.R.
