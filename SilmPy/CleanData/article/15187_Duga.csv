The comic magazine '''''Duga''''' (Bulgarian: '''Дъга''', pronounced IPA: [dɤga]) was a Bulgarian periodical, which produced adaptations by various foreign authors, including Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (issues 25 to 42), among others. The first issue of the magazine was launched in [[1979]].

==The Series==
===''The Hobbit''===
The author and illustrator of the first series, called ''Bilbo Baggins or There and Back Again'' (Bulgarian: ''Билбо Бегинс или Дотам и обратно'', pronounced IPA: [bilbo bɛgins ili dotam i obratno]), was [[Sotir Gelev]], a well known Bulgarian artist and movie director.

===''The Lord of the Rings''===
''The Lord of the Rings'' (Bulgarian: ''Господарят на пръстените'', pronounced IPA: [gospodarjət na prɤstenite]) was written by [[Kancho Kozhuharov]] and illustrated by Sotir Gelev. Unfortunately, the series ended with the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]] after the magazine ceased to exist in [[1992]] with the democratic changes in Bulgaria.

==Copyright issues==

The comic series were never authorized by the [[Tolkien Estate]] as the magazine had ceased to exist by the time democratic changes were brought about in Bulgaria. Nowadays, copies of the comic magazine are extremely hard to find even on the market for collector’s items.
