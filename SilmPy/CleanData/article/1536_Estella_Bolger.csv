'''Estella Brandybuck, n√©e Bolger''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]]. 
__NOTOC__
==History==
Estella was the second child of [[Odovacar Bolger]] and [[Rosamunda Took]]. She was present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. 

Her older brother, [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar]], was well acquainted with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], and Estella eventually married him after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{App|Bolger}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Estella'' is related to the Spanish ''Estrella'', derived from the Latin ''stella'', both meaning "star".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names", p. 197</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Tolkien added Estella to the family trees in Appendix C in the mid-1960s during the revisions that led to the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''. For unclear reasons<ref>{{PM|Trees}}</ref> she did not initially appear in the hardcover edition, but only in the mass-market paperback edition published by [[Ballantine Books]]. Estella was finally added to the hardcover edition after an update to the text in 1987.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', "Note on the Text" (by [[Douglas A. Anderson]])</ref>
