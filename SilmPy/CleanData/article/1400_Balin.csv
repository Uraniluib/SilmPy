{{Pronounce|Balin.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Balin''' was a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] leader, the son of [[Fundin]] and elder brother of [[Dwalin]].  He was [[Thorin and Company|one of the Dwarves]] that travelled with [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Gandalf]] to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].  When Bilbo first met Balin, the Dwarf was very old looking with a white beard and a red hood.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

==History==
===Early life===
Balin was born in {{TA|2763}}, the son of [[Fundin]].  When he was seven years old, [[Smaug]] invaded [[Lonely Mountain|the Lonely Mountain]].  After the Dwarves were driven out at great loss in {{TA|2770|n}}, Balin and his father [[Fundin]] lived with their king [[Thrór]] in [[Dunland]].  His brother [[Dwalin]] was born [[Third Age 2772|two years later]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|A3}}</ref>

Fundin fought in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], and fell in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799|n}}.  Balin was present at this battle but in what role was remains unknown.<ref group="note">In a note considered for inclusion in [[Appendix A]] published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien stated that Dwarves reached fighting age around thirty.  Balin was 30 at the start and 36 at the end of the war, so conceivably he did participate as a warrior.</ref>  The [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] under [[Thráin|Thráin II]], including Balin, at first returned to their forges in Dunland, but they moved into [[Eriador]] shortly after, and colonized the [[Blue Mountains]] .<ref name="Durin"/>

Thráin longed to return to Erebor, and with Balin and Dwalin and a few others in {{TA|2841}} he went on an expedition to their ancient hall.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Sauron had them in his sights, eager to take the [[Ring of Thrór]] from the exiled king.  [[Wolves]], [[orcs]] and evil birds harassed the small company as they came east.  One night, as they had crossed the [[Anduin]], an evil rain forced them into the eaves of [[Mirkwood]], and the company was split.  Thráin was never seen again, and Balin and Dwalin returned to the Blue Mountains to report the news to [[Thorin]], the new king of Durin's line.<ref name="Durin"/>

===Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name="TA"/> during [[Gandalf]]'s efforts to persuade Thorin to take Bilbo to Erebor (before the party at [[Bag End]]), Balin played an important if unintentional role.  When Gandalf said that "professional stealth" was needed Balin misunderstood him as recommending a trained treasure-hunter.  As Gandalf defended hobbits in general and the particular hobbit he had in mind, stating that his hobbit had some gold, silver, and crystal, Balin again jumped to the conclusion that Bilbo was an outright thief.  In his anger at this remark Gandalf proclaimed that Bilbo ''had'' to come or else the enterprise would be a failure, and Thorin then agreed to meet the hobbit.  Thus Balin accidentally insured that Bilbo would be part of [[Quest of Erebor|the quest]].<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>

[[File:Darek Zabrocki - Sneaking into Camp.jpg|thumb|250px|Darek Zabrocki - ''Sneaking into Camp'']] 
On the day of the unexpected party Balin was the second Dwarf to appear at Bag End; his comment, "''they have begun to arrive''" flustered the hobbit considerably.  Later, when the Dwarves made music, Balin and his brother Dwalin brought in and play viols.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

On the day after the party Balin stood at the door of the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, awaiting Bilbo's arrival.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>  This was the first of many instances where Balin served as the chief look-out for Thorin's company.  In fact, it was when Bilbo (wearing the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] and thus invisible) sneaked past Balin on look-out duty after their adventures with the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] in the mountains that Balin began to develop great respect for the hobbit.<ref name="Pan">{{H|Pan}}</ref>

Balin and his brother Dwalin tended to act together as a pair.  In the clearing of the [[Wargs]] Balin and Dwalin were the two who swarmed up a tall slender fir.<ref name="Pan"/>  When the Dwarves arrived at [[Beorn]]'s [[Beorn's Hall|hall]], the two brothers were the third pair to appear.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  Thorin did split the two when the crossed the [[Enchanted River]] – Balin went in the first boatload with Thorin, Bilbo, and [[Fíli]] while Dwalin came last with [[Bombur]].<ref  name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref>

Balin's growing fondness for Bilbo became apparent after the hobbit had rescued the Dwarves from the spiders in [[Mirkwood]].  Having seen Bilbo vanish they, especially Balin, wanted the true story of [[Gollum]] and the Ring explained.  Finally satisfied as to how Bilbo had sneaked past him after the mountains, Balin called the hobbit "Good old Bilbo".<ref name="Flies"/>

When the Dwarves were hauled before the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] they did not know that Thorin had been taken before them and put into a cell deep in the king's dungeon.  Balin, being the second oldest of the party, became the spokes-dwarf.  His angry, surly answers to Thranduil led to their confinement too.<ref name="Barrels">{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

Balin and Dwalin were two of the most unhappy Dwarves when unpacked from their barrels before [[Lake-town]] and were not asked to help release the others.<ref name="Barrels"/>  After leaving the town and as their ponies trudged towards the Mountain, Balin and Bilbo rode together in the rear, leading ponies laden with supplies.<ref name="Door">{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Visit to Bilbo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alan Lee]] - "Visit to Bilbo"]]
That Balin had become the fondest of Bilbo of all the Dwarves was demonstrated when the hobbit made his first descent into the Lonely Mountain.  None of the other Dwarves volunteered to accompany Bilbo except for Balin, who did go partway down the passageway.  Balin waited there and when Bilbo returned he delightedly carried the tired hobbit back to the door.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>  Later, when Bilbo dropped his torch in [[Smaug]]'s lair, Balin pointed out that it was the Dwarves turn to help and declared that he was quite willing to go.<ref name="Home">{{H|Home}}</ref>

Upon escaping from Erebor, Balin led the company to [[Ravenhill]].<ref name="Home"/>  Balin later fought valiantly and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

In the autumn of {{TA|2949|n}}, Balin accompanied Gandalf to visit Bilbo in [[the Shire]].<ref name="TA"/>  Bilbo noted that Balin's beard was many inches longer and that he wore a magnificent jeweled belt.  The three friends talked for hours and Bilbo learned of the new prosperity of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the restored town of [[Dale]].<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria and his death===
[[File:Joona Kujanen - Balin, Lord of Moria.jpg|300px|thumb|Joona Kujanen - ''Balin, Lord of Moria'']]Though the riches of Erebor made the Dwarves prosperous again, there were many who longed to return to [[Moria]]. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] counseled against it, but Balin mounted an expedition in {{TA|2989}}.
<ref name="Many Meetings">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> They hoped to regain the treasures, and Balin had also hoped to find the [[Ring of Thrór]], which was assumed to be lost when [[Thrór]] entered the Gates years before.<ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Together with [[Flói]], [[Óin]], [[Ori]], [[Frár]], [[Lóni]], [[Náli]] and many other Dwarves, Balin entered [[Dimrill Dale]]. After a short battle the group entered the [[Great Gates]]. They stayed in the [[Twenty-first Hall]], and Balin set up his throne in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]]. He proclaimed himself [[Lord of Moria]].<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

For five years the colony thrived. They managed to find many old treasures, mithril, and armouries. But on [[10 November]] {{TA|2994}}, as Balin went to look in [[Mirrormere]], an orc archer fatally shot him. Balin's body was placed in [[Balin's Tomb|a tomb]] in the Chamber of Mazarbul.<ref name="Bridge"/>

But the archer was just the van of the orcs who came up the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]]. The Dwarves were trapped. After a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle in the halls]] and a [[Last Stand of Balin's Colony|final stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul]] the colony was completely wiped out.<ref name="Bridge"/> Not knowing what really happened, [[Glóin]] and his son [[Gimli]] were sent to [[Rivendell]] to seek news about the colony.

Gimli eventually learned of their fate when he crossed the dwarven realm with the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] and found [[Balin's Tomb]].<ref name="Bridge"/>

==Etymology==
Though most names from the Dwarves in ''The Hobbit'' come from the [[Völuspá]], ''Balin'' is not one of them. The name rhymes with [[Dwalin]], but has no apparent meaning.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, "Roast Mutton", note 20</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Balin'' may be derived from [[Old Norse]] ''bál'' ("fire"), thus meaning "Burning-one". Allan also links the name to ''[[Wikipedia:Le Morte d'Arthur|Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', which includes a character named ''Balyn'' (spelled ''Balin'' in some editions) and to a ''Beli'' of ''[[Wikipedia:Mabinogion|The Mabinogion]]''.<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 223</ref><ref group=note>It is known that Tolkien worked on editions of both ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and ''The Mabinogion''; cf. ''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'' and ''[[Pwyll Prince of Dyved]]'', respectively.</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
There are a number of differences regarding Balin as presented in early texts as opposed to the published version of ''The Hobbit''.  Below is a list of noticeable differences:
* Earlier, Balin's beard was yellow instead of white, and his hood was described first as scarlet and then as yellow before red became the final choice.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 32</ref>
* Originally it was Dwalin who spotted the Trolls' fire on the hillside; later this was changed to Balin.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref>
* When Balin and others scouted the [[Front Gate]] at Erebor, in the pre-publication version referred to ravens nearby as "spies of evil".<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}</ref>  In the published story the suspicious birds were changed to crows.<ref name="Door"/>

In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Balin had a son named [[Burin]] (or [[Frár]]). Burin accompanied [[Glóin]] to the [[Council of Elrond]], and became part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. The character was changed to [[Gimli]], son of Glóin in the final version.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>
