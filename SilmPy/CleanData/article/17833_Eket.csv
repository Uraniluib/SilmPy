The '''eket''' was a short stabbing sword wielded by the [[Númenóreans]]. It was described as ''"a short stabbing sword with a broad blade, pointed and two-edged, from a foot to one and a half feet long."''<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 28</ref>

[[Isildur]] carried one on his way to [[Arnor]]. While escaping the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], he retained the eket after discarding the rest of his war gear to swim across [[Anduin]] . 
==Inspiration==
The sword's description is similar in many ways to the ''[[Wikipedia:Gladius|Gladius]]'' carried by Roman legionnaires.
