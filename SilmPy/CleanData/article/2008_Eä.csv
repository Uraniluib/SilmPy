'''Eä''' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈe.a]}}), the '''Created World''',<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> is the [[Quenya]] name for the universe, as a realization of the vision of the [[Ainur]]. Thus, Eä is ''the World that Is'', as distinguished from the [[Timeless Halls]] of [[Ilúvatar]] and the [[Void]], that have no material form.
==Creation==
Eä was conceived in the [[Music of the Ainur]] and then visualized in the beautiful [[Vision]] that Ilúvatar showed to the Ainur to see for themselves what they sang. The Vision showed a World sustained inside the Void, but without being part of it, and developing life on its own. The Ainur desired all this to be real, and Ilúvatar brought this into actuality by saying ''[[ea (verb)|Eä]]'' and sent His [[Flame Imperishable]] into the Void to burn at the heart of the World. Thus Eä was set amid the Void.<ref name=ainu/>

When the Valar entered Eä they become part of it and could not leave it willingly or not, until [[the End]].<ref name=ainu/><ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref> At the beginning of Time, Eä was dark and unshaped, and the Ainur who entered it had to labor in the vast wastes for ages beyond knowledge or reckoning to fulfill the Vision.<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> During their labors, [[Varda]] created the [[stars]]<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>, and [[Manwe]], [[Aule]], and [[Ulmo]] chiefly worked for the formation of [[Arda]] at the beginning of its existence.<ref name=ainu/><ref name=Annals>{{MR|P2a}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P3I1}}</ref> Other [[spirits]] wandered around Eä, and [[Melkor]] gathered some to his service.<ref name=Annals/>

==Description==
Eä is described as being of "vast halls and spaces" burning with "wheeling fires" and histories unfolding amidst the "Deeps of [[Time]]", such as the waking of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and the [[Dominion of Men]].<ref name=ainu>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> Eä has vast regions beyond the thought of Elves and Men. However its shape, duration, extent and size are not described. Of all Eä, only [[Arda]], the world inhabited by the Children, is known.

Eä is sustained into the Void without being part of it, separated from it by the [[Walls of the World]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Walls of the World"</ref> At the end of the [[First Age]], the Valar threw Melkor to the Void through the [[Door of Night]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Ea.mp3|Ardamir}}
''[[ea (verb)|Eä]]'' is the [[Quenya]] verb "to be", and was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which he created the universe.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==

In earlier works, the [[Qenya]] word ''[[Ilu]]'' is translated as "world"<ref>{{SM|5d}}</ref> in the sense of the "universe", from the [[root]] ILU "all, the whole".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[IL]]</ref> 

In the 1930s [[Ambarkanta]], the World is described as a globe of air enclosed in [[Vaiya]] and the [[Ilurambar]], the Walls of the World that separate Vaiya from nothingness and the [[Void]].<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref> The [[Ambarkanta maps]] schematics are labelled as "ILU".<ref>{{SM|A1}}</ref><ref>{{SM|A2}}</ref> 

As the word Ilu doesn't make a distinction between the concepts of "Arda" and "Eä" of the later ''[[Silmarillion]]'', the two seem to be mostly equated; in that context, all universe consists only of [[Ambar]] and the airs around it.

Eä first appeared in a later version of the Ainulindalë, which here introduced the new concept of Arda set within an indefinite vastness of the Creation.<ref>{{MR|P1e}}</ref> Around the same time, Tolkien changed the conception of Ilurambar to Earambar.<ref>{{MR|P2c}}</ref>

In the later [[Round World version of the Silmarillion]], the text mentions that Eä is vast beyond measure with the stars belonging to other and remoter parts of its Great Tale. In the Beginning, the innumerable Ainur shaped Eä and labored amid remote stars and worlds; but we could know only those who followed [[Manwë]] to Arda, which is of central importance in the Great Tale of Eä.<ref>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>
