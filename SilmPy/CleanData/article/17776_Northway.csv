The '''Northway''' was a road in [[the Shire]]. It is named as such only in the 1960 rewrite of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', published in ''[[The History of The Hobbit: Return to Bag-End]]'', so it may not be considered canonical.<ref name="HH">{{HH|T1}}, p. 815</ref>

The road sprang from the [[East Road]] just west of [[Frogmorton]], crossed [[the Water]], and led to [[Oatbarton]]. A side-road branched off just before the Northway reached the [[Northfarthing]] and stretched to [[Dwaling]] and [[Brockenbores]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> On the intersection stood an inn, the [[All-Welcome Inn]].<ref name="HH"/>
