__NOTOC__
'''Fen Hollen''' or the '''Steward's Door''' was on the sixth level of [[Minas Tirith]], in its rearward wall to the west. It led to [[Rath DÃ­nen]] (the Silent Street) and the [[Hallows]] where the tombs of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] and [[Kings of Gondor]] lay.

Guarded by a porter, the door was also called the '''Closed Door''' as it opened only for funerals, or to those who tended the tombs and had the token.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>

Around the time of the [[Siege of Gondor]], [[Beregond]] killed the porter in order to save wounded [[Faramir]] and took his key. After he locked the Door again, [[Gandalf]] gave the key to the injured [[Faramir]].<ref>{{RK|Pyre}}</ref>
