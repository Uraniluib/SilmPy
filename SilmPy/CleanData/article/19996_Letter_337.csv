==Summary==
A Mr. Wrigley had predicted that academics would be occupied with searching for sources to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' for several generations. Tolkien feared that he was right, but considered the particular use at a particular situation of any motive, whether invented, deliberately borrowed or unconsciously remembered the most interesting.
