== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
'''Ingil''' (as was his name in the earlier stages of development) was the son of [[Ingwë#Other versions of the legendarium|Inwë]] in the [[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|Book of Lost Tales]]. He was among the [[Elves]] who came to [[Tol Eressea]]. He rested upon [[Kôr]] with other Elves and built a tall grey tower. The dwelling was called Koromas, but was later known as [[Kortirion]], in memory of their ancient dwelling of Kôr in [[Valinor]] which also upon a hill and had a similar tower.<ref>{{LT1|I}}</ref><ref>{{HM|LT2}}</ref>

[[Meril-i-Turinqi]] said that long ago he returned to Valinor and is with [[Manwe]].<ref>{{LT1|In}}</ref> He became a blue bee to follow [[Telimektar]] and is seen among the [[stars]] as [[Nielluin]] (Sirius).<ref>{{LT1|VIIIn}}</ref>

In later versions of the ''Silmarillion'', this character is named '''Ingwiel''' in most of the references, and in at least one instance he is mention to lead the Valinorean [[Noldor]] to the War, instead of [[Finarfin]].<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}</ref> Only in one of his last references his name was altered to '''Ingwion''',<ref>{{WJ|Last}}</ref> which is used in this article.
