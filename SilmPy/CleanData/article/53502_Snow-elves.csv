The '''Snow-elves''' lived at the North Pole. Not much is known about the Snow-elves; apparently they dressed in white (unlike the [[Red Elves|Red]] and [[Green-elves#Other writings|Green Elves]]), since they blended with the snow.<ref name=1929b>{{LFC|1929b}}</ref>

The Snow-elves only appear once in tales of the ''[[Letters from Father Christmas|Father Christmas Letters]]'', at a celebration of the coming of winter. The festivities were organised by [[Father Christmas]], and included a Bonfire to make the [[North Polar Bear]] happy. To the surprise of Father Christmas and the Polar Bear, the Snow-elves let off all the rockets — hundreds of them — together.<ref name=1929b/>
