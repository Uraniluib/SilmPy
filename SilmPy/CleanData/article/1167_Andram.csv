'''Andram''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. 'long wall'; [[and]] = long, [[ram]] = wall) was the long wall of hills that ran across [[Beleriand]] west to east, from beyond [[Nargothrond]] to the [[Gates of Sirion]] and ending at [[Ramdal]], being three leagues in width from north to south<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 262</ref>.  The wall was pierced in two places: the gorge of Nargothrond, through which flowed the River [[Narog]], and where the River [[Sirion]] ran underground from its falls south of the [[Aelin-uial]] to its reappearance at the [[Gates of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

Its easternmost hill was [[Amon Ereb]], which usually was not considered a part of Andram (indeed ''Ramdal'' meant "Wall's End").<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>
