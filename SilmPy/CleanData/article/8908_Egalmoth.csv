'''Egalmoth''', who lived during the [[First Age]], was a [[Noldor|Noldorin]]<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref> [[Elves|elf]] of [[Gondolin]], the leader of the [[Folk of the Heavenly Arch]].  He wore a blue mantle upon which stars were embroidered in crystal, and his sword was "bent" (none of the other Noldor carried curved swords).  However, he trusted more to his bow, for he could shoot high and far.

He was also one of the escorts King [[Turgon]] sent to accompany [[Aredhel]] on her way out of the [[Hidden City]] to her brother [[Fingon]], along with [[Glorfindel]] and [[Ecthelion]].<ref name="maeglin">{{WJ|Maeglin}}, p. 318.</ref>

He survived the [[Fall of Gondolin]], and fled to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].  He later died in the attack by the [[Sons of FÃ«anor]].

==Etymology==

'''''Egalmoth''''' is formed by a consonant metathesis of the word ''aegamloth'' which means "A Spike upon a Flowered Crest" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[aeg]]'' = "point" and ''[[amloth]]'' = "flowered crest, implying a crest on a helmet").<ref name="maeglin" />
