'''Tarcil''' ({{TA|280}}<ref name=PM/> – {{TA|515|n}},<ref name=App/> aged 235 years) was the sixth [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Tarcil succeeded his father, [[Arantar]], when he died in 435. Tarcil was great-great-grandson of [[Isildur]].

Tarcil ruled uneventfully for eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Tarondor (King of Arnor)|Tarondor]], upon his death in 515.<ref name=App/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Tarcil'' (also spelt ''[[Tarkil]]'')<ref group="note">The name of the sixth king of Arnor was spelt ''Tarkil'' in a draft of the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]], later amended to ''Tarcil'' in the published text. Cf. {{PM|VII}}, p. 192.</ref> also appears in early stages of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as another nickname for [[Aragorn]]: its meaning is apparently "[[High Man]]", a synonym for [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]].<ref>{{TI|Gandalf}}, p. 8</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 603</ref> The [[Orkish]] term "[[tarks|tark]]" for a Dúnadan is possibly derived from this.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 101</ref>
