'''Tolkien's Monsters''' is the ninth episode of [[wikipedia:History (TV channel)|the History channel]]'s "[[wikipedia:Clash of the Gods|Clash of the Gods]]" series. The first seven episodes were on Greek mythology, followed by one on ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''. The tenth and last episode was on Thor, the Norse god of Thunder.

==Synopsis==
The episode features expert interviews and reenactments, as it endeavours to explain the sources and origins behind the story. The story explores ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', with reenactments and computer simulations. 

==Errors==
* Not much attention was paid to make-up; Dwarves are portrayed beardless, Hobbits are just bare footed (Bilbo even has a beard) and Elves all have an unexplained tattoo on their right cheek, the only thing that distinguishes them from Men. 
* The actor playing the older [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] has a mustache. Though he did have a mustache during [[World War I|the Great War]], he did not retain it. Ironically, reenactments of his war years show him clean shaven, and wearing the insignia of a US Army corporal rather than a British second lieutenant.
* Though the experts and the narrator do a generally good job with pronunciation, [[Ainur]] is pronounced "Aniur".
