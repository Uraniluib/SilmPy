The river '''Adorn''' was one of the rivers which arose in the [[White Mountains]] flowing northwest, and joined with the Isen about 150 [[Númenor|Númenórean]] miles west of the [[Gap of Rohan]] at the borders of [[Enedwaith]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

Together with the river [[Sîr Angren|Angren]] the Adorn formed the western border of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>  The triangle of land between the Isen, Adorn, and the [[White Mountains]] was nominally part of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]],<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Note 4</ref> but in the late [[Third Age]] it was a contested area between the [[Rohirrim]] and the [[Dunlendings]]. Lord [[Freca]] held lands at either side of the river around {{TA|2758}}.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>
