The '''Petty-dwarves''' were a diminutive race of [[Dwarves]]. 

Petty-dwarves differed from normal Dwarves in various ways: they were smaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names: other Dwarves kept their [[Khuzdul]] names and language a secret. This may have been one of the reasons they were exiled.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm|website=Arda|title=Khuzdul}}</ref>
==History==
The Petty-dwarves were Dwarves of [presumably] several [[:Category: Dwarven clans|clans]], which had been exiled from eastern Dwarf cities for unclear reasons. They were the first to cross the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[First Age]], and established strongholds in [[Beleriand]] before the [[Elves]] arrived, at [[Nulukkizdîn]] and [[Sharbhund]] (also known as ''Bar-en-Nibin-noeg'', the "House of the Petty Dwarves"). In Beleriand they diminished in physical stature and in smith-craft.<ref name="Turambar1">{{S|21}}</ref>

The [[Sindar]], not acquainted with Dwarves yet, thought the Petty-dwarves were animals, and hunted them. Not until the Dwarves of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]] established contact with the Sindar did they realize what the "animals" were and named them ''Noegyth Nibin''; Petty-dwarves. 

Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but they had already dwindled and hated all [[Elves]] with a passion; especially the [[Noldor]] whom they saw as usurpers who took their lands ([[Nargothrond]] was built in Nulukkizdîn).<ref name="Turambar1"/> In the time of the [[Wars of Beleriand]] the Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. The last remnant of their people were [[Mîm]] and his two sons [[Ibun]] and [[Khîm]], who lived at [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref name="Turambar1"/>

==Names==
A name among the [[Eldar]] for the Petty-dwarves was '''''Levain tad-[[tal|dail]]''''' (biped animals), or simply ''Tad-dail''.<ref>{{WJ|AB}}, p. 388</ref> Another name, used among the [[Sindar]], was '''''Noegyth Nibin''''' or '''''Nibin-Noeg''''' or '''''Nibin-Nogrim'''''.
