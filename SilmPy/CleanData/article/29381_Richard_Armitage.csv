==Quotes==
{{blockquote|The Hobbit has been in my life since I was about 7 years old. It was one of the first books I managed to read from cover to cover, on my own. [...] When I was preparing for the role of [[Thorin]], I spent time reading many of Tolkien's other works, hunting down anything which would help me to imagine what it might be like to live as this 'very important Dwarf' ([[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s words, not mine), and I listened to an old BBC radio recording of Tolkien reading his works.|Introduction, ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: Visual Companion]]'', p. 5}}
