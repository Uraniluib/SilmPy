The '''House of the Hundred Chimneys''', only mentioned in the early version of the [[legendarium]] (the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|Book of Lost Tales]]''), was the ancient house of [[Gilfanon]]. It was located near the bridge of [[Tavrobel]] on [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 175</ref>
==Inspiration==
As the village of Tavrobel was based on [[Wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]], G. L. Elkin, the Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, has suggested to [[Christopher Tolkien]] that the House of Hundred Chimneys may have been based on the [[Wikipedia:Shugborough Hall|Shugborough Hall]], the home of the [[Wikipedia:Earl of Lichfield|Earl of Lichfield]], which features prominent chimneys.<ref>{{LR|A3}}</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have suggested that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was perhaps inspired by a house named Gipsy Green nearby [[Wikipedia:Penkridge|Penkridge]] in [[Wikipedia:Staffordshire|Staffordshire]] (where Tolkien stayed at a camp in [[1918]] recovering from "thrench fever"). As can be seen in an illustration by Tolkien of the house, it features several, prominent chimneys.<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 26</ref>
