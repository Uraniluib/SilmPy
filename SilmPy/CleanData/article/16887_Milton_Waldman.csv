'''Milton Waldman''' ([[1895]]-[[1976]]) was born in the United States and was an adviser and editor for publishers in London. According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]] in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', Waldman was introduced to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] by Father Gervase Mathew in late [[1949]]. Due to the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Waldman expressed interest in both ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Tolkien showed parts of ''The Silmarillion'' to Waldman and Waldman offered to publish it if Tolkien would complete it. He would also publish ''The Lord of the Rings'' if Tolkien felt no commitment to [[Allen and Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]].

In April of [[1950]], Tolkien urged [[Stanley Unwin]] to agree to publish both books, and when Unwin refused, Tolkien took them to Waldman. To Tolkien's disappointment, Waldman told him that ''The Lord of the Rings'' was too long. Waldman then left for Italy for a year and his replacement was much less enthusiastic about Tolkien's works. In late [[1951]] Tolkien wrote a long letter to Waldman explaining how the two works were dependent on each other, but Waldman still refused.

In [[1956]], after ''The Lord of the Rings'' has been published, Waldman unsuccessfully attempted to publish ''The Hobbit'' in Collin's Fontana paperback series.
