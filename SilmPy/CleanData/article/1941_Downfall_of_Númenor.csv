{{main|Changing of the World}}
The '''Downfall of Númenor''' was the utter destruction of the island of [[Númenor]], a divine punishment for King [[Ar-Pharazôn]]'s assault on the [[Undying Lands]].

==History==
===Prelude===
During the [[Second Age]], [[Sauron]], [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] greatest servant, had grown mighty in [[Middle-earth]]. Defeating all resistance and ruling through terror, force, and persuasion, Sauron dominated the peoples of Middle-earth, who looked to Númenor for aid. Heeding their desperate plight, the Númenorians dispatched an immense military force to Middle-earth, and after a period of heavy fighting, defeated Sauron and his hosts. Sauron hid within Mordor, where none dared to assail him, and re-built his strength. After once more reaching a height in his power, and with the armies of Númenor having left Middle-earth, Sauron was for a second time unopposed, and took on the titles '''Lord of the Earth''' and '''King of Men'''.

The Númenorians again received word of his rise in power. Angered by Sauron's pride and wishing to avoid another difficult war, the Númenorians swiftly came once more to Middle-earth with immense military force to confront Sauron a final time. So mighty were they that Sauron's forces fled from them with barely a fight. Sauron, however, realising he could not defeat the Númenorians militarily, allowed himself to be captured, and begged, falsely, for mercy. The Númenorians brought him back as a prisoner, though through Sauron's persuasion, he rose from prisoner to adviser for the King himself. Convincing many officials to worship Morgoth, they quickly became corrupted to his side, to the point where Sauron successfully convinced King Ar-Pharazôn to betray the Valar and besiege them.

[[Elendil]], son of the leader of the Faithful during the reign of Ar-Pharazôn, his sons and his followers had foreseen the disaster that was to befall Númenor, and they had set sail in nine ships before the island fell. His father [[Amandil]] the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]], imitating [[Eärendil]], decided to go West to warn the [[Valar]] about the King's plans.

===Flooding of Númenor===

Prompted by Sauron and fearing death and old age, Ar-Pharazôn built a great armada and set sail into the west to make war upon the Valar and seize the Undying Lands. Sauron remained behind. In the year {{SA|3319|n}}, Ar-Pharazôn and his [[Great Armament]] landed on Aman's shores and marched to the city of [[Valimar]].

The Valar feared that the Númenorean army could wreak havoc in [[Valinor]],<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> but they were forbidden from killing or otherwise using force against Men.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 350</ref> [[Manwë]], chief of the Valar, thus called upon [[Ilúvatar]], who destroyed the [[Great Armament]] of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] that had landed on Aman by crushing it under stones. He also broke and changed the world, taking [[Aman]] and [[Tol Eressëa]] from the world forever, changing [[Arda]]'s shape from flat to round so that no mortal sailor would reach the [[Aman|True West]] again. Númenor was covered by great waves and sank into the abyss, killing its inhabitants, including the body of Sauron; Sauron was robbed of his ability to assume fair and charming forms.

New lands formed in the West to replace the absence of Aman; islands rose and hills were formed. The coastline of Middle-earth also felt the effects of the cataclysm. In some places the coasts retreated, and in others they had advanced. [[Lindon]] in particular suffered great loss from the advance of the coasts, whereas the coasts had retreated to the east and south of the [[Bay of Belfalas]], putting [[Pelargir]] much further inland than it had been and nearly destroying [[Tolfalas]]. As the [[Anduin]] found new courses along the new coasts, the [[Ethir Anduin]] formed.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref>

===Survival===
Just a few people, the [[Faithful]], still uncorrupted by Sauron managed to escape the catastrophe; they fled Númenor by ship, carrying some gifts that the Dúnedain had received from the Valar and the Elves in times of peace. These were the ''[[Palantíri]]'', the [[Ring of Barahir]], the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], [[Narsil]] and a fruit of [[Nimloth the Fair]] stolen by [[Isildur]]. They were led by [[Elendil]] the Tall and his two sons, Isildur and [[Anárion]].

They landed in [[Middle-earth]] and met the colonists who were in the settlements of those lands among the [[Middle Men]]; the followers of Elendil united them by establishing two kingdoms which came to be known as the realms of Exile: [[Gondor]] in the south, and [[Arnor]] in the north. The culture of Númenor became the dominant culture of Middle-earth (thus, [[Westron]], a descendant of the [[Adûnaic]] language of Númenor, became the [[Westron|Common Speech]]). The sadness and the shock from the loss of their island home always remained in the hearts of Kings of Númenórean descent. 

They were dismayed to discover that Sauron, although greatly diminished and bereft of shape, had survived the Downfall and returned to Middle-earth with [[the One Ring]] to continue troubling its inhabitants. 

Meanwhile some of the [[King's Men]] had established other realms in exile to the south; of these the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]] was the chief and continued to reign the lands there. These were known as [[Black Númenóreans]].

==Legacy==
After its fall Númenor was called ''[[Akallabêth]]'' or ''[[Atalantë]]'' in [[Quenya]], meaning "the Downfallen", ''[[Mar-nu-Falmar]]'' ("Land under the Waves").
 
Sauron's plan to destroy Númenor had been overwhelmingly successful, and though he too was caught by the flooding, he escaped, and at some point, returned to Middle-earth, believing himself to now be fully unopposed.
