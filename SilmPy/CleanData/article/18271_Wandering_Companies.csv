The '''Wandering Companies''' were traveling groups of [[Elves]] in [[Eriador]] of the [[Third Age]]. 

They set out from [[Rivendell]] to various destinations, of which only the [[Tower Hills]] are known. [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]] encountered one such Wandering Company, led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], in September {{TA|3018}}. They were on their way back to Rivendell, after having gazed in the ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]'' of the Tower Hills, seeking [[Varda|Elbereth]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}</ref>
