==The Poem==
<poem>
"O the hoot! O the hoot!
How he trillups on his flute!
O the hoot of Tinfang Warble!
Dancing all alone,
Hopping on a stone,
Flitting like a fawn,
In the twilight on the lawn,
And his name is Tinfang Warble!
The first star has shown
And its lamp is blown
to a flame of flickering blue.
He pipes not to me,
He pipes not to thee,
He whistles for none of you.
His music is his own,
The tunes of Tinfang Warble!"
</poem>
:&mdash; [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]

In the earliest version Tinfang is called a 'leprawn', and
in the Gnomish speech he is a 'fay'.
