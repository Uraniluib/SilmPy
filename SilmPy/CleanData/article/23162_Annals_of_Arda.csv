The '''Annals of Arda''' is a Family Tree and Encyclopedia website started around [[2000]]. It was all made by a single person based in Denmark.

It was designed to make possible to find any information about any object, place, name, event and/or relationship. There were categories titles '''Valar, Maiar, Elves, Humans, Dwarves, Hobbits, Orcs, Others, Objects, Battles, Maps, Places''' and '''Misc'''.

The last major updates were made in 2005. After that, there were some recent updates concerning the website code, and some disclaimers about the website copyright, the ''[[Children of HÃºrin]]'', and that the webmaster won't be able to resume work in the same pace.
