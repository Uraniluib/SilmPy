==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
A misty path through woods long past 
enshrined in silence and runes will keep 
the secrets of Dol Guldur 

Far away and over the cold fog mountains 
our gleaming eyes are searching for a sign 
and down to the deepest dungeons 
and to the old forgotten lair 

We must leave now, before a new day breaks 
to search for the pale gold 
that once belonged to the forest 

By the sounds of pounding hammers 
that sound like bells of the elves 
in our ears... 
we are still searching in the underground 
where our dark secrets sleep 

Far away over the cold fog mountains 
we have to leave now, before a new day breaks 
eternally...
</poem>
