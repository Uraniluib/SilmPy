'''Gwaihir''' was the greatest and the swiftest of the [[Eagles]] of [[Middle-earth]] at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
A descendant of [[Thorondor]], it is said that Gwaihir was his vassal in the [[First Age]] and, with his brother [[Landroval]], helped rescue [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from [[Angband]].<ref name=P1>{{WJ|P1}} p. 68</ref> In the [[Third Age]] he was the greatest and the swiftest of the Eagles of the North.

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Radagast]] sought help of his old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: [[wolves]] and [[Orcs]] gathering and mustering, the movements of the [[Nazgûl|Nine Riders]], and the escape of [[Gollum]] from [[Mirkwood]].

As instructed by Gandalf, Radagast sent Gwaihir to bear the news to him at [[Isengard]], but Gandalf was at that time imprisoned at the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. On an autumn night, Gandalf saw the Eagle flying towards him and so Gwaihir rescued the Wizard. But Gwaihir couldn't carry him far, so Gwaihir left him at [[Edoras]] in order to find a steed.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

Later he was sent by [[Galadriel]] to find Gandalf; he found him on the peak of [[Celebdil]] after the [[Battle of the Peak]], and carried him to [[Lothlórien]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>

Gwaihir, [[Meneldor]] and [[Landroval]] helped the [[Free peoples]] in the [[Battle of the Morannon]]; in the aftermath, they brought [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] out of [[Mordor]] after [[the One Ring]] was destroyed.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gwaihir.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Gwaihir''''' comes from [[Sindarin]] ''[[gwaew]]'' ("wind")<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 33-4</ref> and possibly ''[[hîr]]'' "lord".  His name could thus likely be translated as "Windlord".

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Eagles named "Gwaihir" and "Landroval" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in early ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', as vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from [[Angband]]<ref name=P1/>. These references were removed by [[Christopher Tolkien]] to escape the seeming discrepancy with ''The Lord of the Rings'', although later he admitted that he was not sure about his father's intentions.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}} Chs. 12–15, p. 301–3</ref><ref>{{SD|V}}</ref>

It is generally thought that Gwaihir is the [[Lord of the Eagles]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', although [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never makes a connection nor mentions that Gwaihir was Lord of the Eagles. This notion is also seen in [[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]''.

In the whole ''Lord of the Rings'' Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says that Gwaihir had carried him twice<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>; this implies that Gwaihir never carried him before the timeframe of the book.
