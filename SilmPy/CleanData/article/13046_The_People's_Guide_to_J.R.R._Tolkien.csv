===From the Publisher===
Tolkien fans around the world have for many years been enthralled with [[The Hobbit]], [[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Silmarillion]] and all the works of background reading about [[Middle-earth]]. There have been quite a few scholarly books published about [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and his 'sub-creation.' Yet not one book has ever been written by and published for Professor Tolkien's fans - until now! The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien fills a void that has been there for more than half a century. Written by [http://www.theonering.net TheOneRing.net], the Internet's #1 destination for all things Tolkien, The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien has compiled the best essays from the website, along with material never seen before.

Inside you'll find spirited discussions on The Lord of the Rings movies (along with a lengthy report from the set), a defense of fantasy, the nature of good and evil, fate and free will, cultural norms, the northern myths and literature that inspired Tolkien, how Tolkien's fiction has affected the lives of so many, an entire section devoted to answering the fans' myriad, fascinating questions - and some beautiful illustrations representing TheOneRing.net's wonderful fan art.
