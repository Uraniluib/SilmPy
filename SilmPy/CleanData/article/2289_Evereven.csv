'''Evereven''' or '''Ever-eve''' was a poetic name for the region of [[Aman]] from which [[Eärendil]] set out on his epic journeys beyond the World. It appears only in [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s '[[Song of Eärendil]]' at [[Rivendell]],<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> and so the term may have been meant as Bilbo's own invention. In the poem, it's described as being a land of hills and fountains. 

[[Galadriel's Song of Eldamar]] mentions a similar term: ''Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in [[Eldamar]] it shone.''

The name seems to be a reference to the land of [[Valinor]]<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Evereven"</ref>, though its precise identity is difficult to pin down. 
==Meaning==
In the original conception, Eärendil undertook an epic journey carrying him on a cycle from Evereven through [[Evernight]], [[Evernoon]] and [[Evermorn]]. Much of this was lost from the final form of the song, so that while the names Evereven and Evernight both survived into [[The Lord of the Rings]], their context and meaning have become difficult to identify.
