'''Tar-Meneldur''' was the fifth [[King of Númenor]].

== History ==
Meneldur's birth name was [[Írimon]],<ref name="Kings">{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Meneldur</ref> and was the son of [[Tar-Elendil]]; he had wo older sisters, [[Silmariën]] and [[Isilmë]]. At this time, [[Númenóreans]] began to sail eastwards and in {{SA|600}} the [[Captain of the King's Ships]], [[Vëantur]], reached the [[Grey Havens]].<ref name="Wife"/>

His great passion was stargazing and learning all he could about the Heavens from the lore of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. To study the movements of the stars, he built a tower in the [[Forostar]], the northernmost part of Númenor, since the sky was clearer there than anywhere else on the isle he also received the title [[Elentirmo]].<ref name="Númenor">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Although Meneldur had no love for the sea, he did fall in love with Vëantur’s daughter, [[Almarian]], and married her.<ref name="Wife"/> Together they had three children, a son [[Anardil of Númenor|Anardil]] and two daughters, [[Ailinel]] and [[Almiel]], all born before Meneldur became king in {{SA|740}}.<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref>

As the eldest son, but the youngest child of [[Tar-Elendil]], Tar-Meneldur received the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] due to the old law of royal [[Law of Succession in Númenor|succession]] that existed at that time.<ref name="Wife"/> Meneldur only left the tower when he inherited the Sceptre, but even after becoming King his interest in the stars did not cease.<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Meneldur's son Anardil grew swiftly and became known as [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]]. Like his grandfather Vëantur, Aldarion became enamoured of the sea: in {{SA|725}} Vëantur invited Aldarion to sail with him to [[Middle-earth]]; to this plan Meneldur gave his reluctant consent. When the voyagers returned in {{SA|727|n}} Meneldur's joy was great, but soon his son begged leave to sail again. Two more long voyages followed in {{SA|730|n}} and {{SA|735|n}}. However, when Tar-Elendil relinquished the Sceptre to Tar-Meneldur in {{SA|740|n}}, Aldarion remained at home for awhile for the comfort of his father.{{fact}}

After a time the sea-longing came upon Aldarion anew. He formed a [[Guild of Venturers]] and left [[Armenelos]] to reside on his ship [[Eämbar]]. Then Tar-Meneldur looked coldly upon the sea-enterprises of his son, believing that they engendered restlessness and a desire for dominion over other lands. Father and son became estranged but Almarian supported Aldarion and thus Tar-Meneldur let matters proceed unhindered. Tar-Meneldur did try to curb his son's activities by prohibiting the cutting of trees for shipbuilding, but this only resulted in Aldarion's seeking lumber in Middle-earth.

In {{SA|800}} Tar-Meneldur commanded his son to cease voyaging, for Aldarion was of an age (one hundred years old) to be proclaimed the King's Heir. The two were then reconciled, for a time. However, six years later Aldarion sought and obtained Tar-Meneldur's grudging leave to go to sea again. At the same time Almarian and Tar-Meneldur were encouraging Aldarion to marry, and in the Queen's household there was one, [[Erendis]], who attracted the prince’s attention. Although Aldarion did fall in love with Erendis it did not prevent him from sailing again. When he returned from this journey Tar-Meneldur forbade his son from leaving, yet Aldarion did so in defiance of the King. Hard upon his return Aldarion left for a twenty-year voyage which disquieted the King.

Tar-Meneldur rejoiced when Aldarion and Erendis were finally betrothed in {{SA|858}}, yet they were not married until {{SA|870|n}} after Aldarion had gone on yet another sea venture. Aldarion and Erendis' marriage proved to be unhappy and only produced one child, their daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]].

In {{SA|882}} Aldarion brought [[Gil-galad's letter|a letter]] from King [[Gil-galad]] to Tar-Meneldur. In it the King of the Elves warned Tar-Meneldur that a new shadow was arisen in the East and beseeched him for aid. From this letter Tar-Meneldur learned that his son had aided the Elves and knew much of what these matters portended. Recognizing that his son was better equipped to handle this menace, Tar-Meneldur resolved to resign the Sceptre to his son; this he did in the year {{SA|883|n}}.<ref name="Wife"/>

Tar-Meneldur passed the Sceptre to his son long before due time. He lived for 59 more years before he died in {{SA|942}}.<ref name="Kings"/>

== Etymology ==
All of Tar-Meneldur's names were in [[Quenya]]. Írimon itself means "Beautiful Man" (from ''[[írima]]'' "beautiful" and ''[[-on]]'', a masculine suffix). Meneldur means "Servant of the Heavens" (from Quenya ''[[menel]]'' "the Heavens" and ''[[-ndur]]'' "servant"); he took this name because of his love for stargazing. Elentirmo is another name that referred to his interest in the Heavens; it signifies "Star Watcher" (from ''[[elen]]'' "star", ''[[tir]]'' "watch", and ''[[-mo]]'', a masculine agentive suffix). Like all the rulers of Númenor who took their royal names in Quenya, Meneldur added the prefix ''[[tar-]]'' ("high") to his title when he received the Sceptre.

Gil-galad's letter refers to him as a "[[High King]]", whereas no other King of Númenor is mentioned to have this status. It possibly implies an overlordship of the King of Númenor not only on his island, but also the Númenorean colonists of Middle-earth.
