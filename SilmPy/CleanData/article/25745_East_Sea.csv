The '''East Sea''', also called the '''Eastern Sea''', was the sea between [[Middle-earth]] and the [[Land of the Sun]].<ref name=A4>{{SM|A4}}</ref><ref name="Fashion">{{SM|5b}}</ref>{{rp|293}}

==History==
Initially, the size and shape of the East Sea corresponded symmetrically with [[Belegaer]], the Western Sea separating Middle-earth from [[Aman]], but when Melkor cast down the [[Two Lamps]], this symmetry was lost; Middle-earth was thrust eastward, causing Belegaer to expand and the East Sea to narrow.<ref>{{SM|5e}}, pp. 301-2</ref><ref name="Fashion" />{{rp|292-3}}<ref group=note>Belegaer was also said to grow "wide and deep" during the [[War for the Sake of the Elves]], presumably causing the East Sea to further shrink. See {{MR|P2e}}, p. 75</ref> At this time, the East Sea was narrowest in the extreme north and south of the world, where only small straits filled with ice separated Middle-earth and the Land of the Sun. These straits connected the East Sea to [[Ekkaia]], the Outer Sea.<ref name=A4 />

During the [[War for the Sake of the Elves]] between the [[Valar]] and [[Melkor]], the East Sea became connected to Belegaer. The inland [[Sea of Ringil]], originally set in the mid-south of Middle-earth, grew in size and "became a great sea flowing north-eastward and joining by straights both the Western and Eastern Seas."<ref group=note>Confusingly, the former Sea of Ringil was also called the "East Sea" by Tolkien on one early map. See {{SM|A5}}.</ref><ref name="Fashion"/>{{rp|293-4}}

After Melkor defiled the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], the Valar used the fruit of [[Laurelin]] to create the [[Sun]] and the flower of [[Telperion]] to create the [[Moon]].<ref name=S11>{{S|11}}</ref> In the evenings, the Sun set in the [[Outer Sea]] to the west of Aman, where it was pulled down by [[Ulmo]]'s servants and sent under the earth<ref name=S11 /> to the East Sea, where it rose at dawn.<ref>{{App|D2}} ("Later [the Númenóreans] also made their week one of 7 days, and they reckoned the day from sunrise (out of the eastern sea) to sunrise.")</ref> The Moon followed the Sun on this path.<ref name=S11 />

In the [[Second Age]], the [[Númenóreans]] sailed about Middle-earth to the [[uttermost east]]<ref>{{L|131}}("[The Númenóreans] sail[ed] to the uttermost north, and south, and east.")</ref> and could see the [[Gates of Morning]] from their ships,<ref name=S>{{S|IV}}</ref> suggesting that they sailed into the East Sea. It was also in this age that a final change was made to the earth that likely affected the East Sea: when [[Ilúvatar]] sunk Númenor and made the world round, he "cast back ... the [[Empty Lands]] east of [Middle-earth], and new lands and seas were made".<ref name=S /> How this impacted the geography of the East Sea is unknown.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the Uttermost East ([[Oronto]]) was connected to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], directly east of [[Palisor]], with no separating water. [[Oromë]] described the East to the [[Valar]], saying that "''there is a silent beach and dark empty seas''". It is also told that [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]] "''builded great havens'' [of the Sun and Moon] ''beside the soundless sea''".<ref>{{LT1|IX}}</ref><ref>{{SM|5e}}</ref>

In early texts, [[Hildórien]] - the site where the first [[Men]] awoke in the [[First Age]] - was placed in the central region of Middle-earth near the shore of the East Sea. Hildórien was surrounded by the [[Mountains of the Wind]], a semi-circular mountain chain that derived its named from the strong winds that blew into them from over the East Sea due to the rising of the Sun.<ref name=A4 /><ref name="Fashion"/>{{rp|293}} In later texts, Hildórien is said to be "in the midmost parts of Middle-earth" with no mention of the East Sea or the Mountains of the Wind.<ref>{{WJ|9}}, p. 174</ref>
