'''Clive Staples "Jack" Lewis''' ([[29 November]], [[1898]] â€“ [[22 November]], [[1963]]), commonly referred to as '''C.S. Lewis''', was an Irish-born English writer and scholar. Lewis is known for his work on medieval literature, Christian apologetics, literary criticism, and fiction. He is best known today for his series ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.

Lewis was a close friend of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Both authors were leading figures in the English faculty at [[Oxford University]] and in the informal Oxford literary group known as the [[Inklings]]. According to his memoir ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', Lewis had been baptised in the Church of Ireland at birth, but fell away from his faith during his adolescence. Owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, at about the age of 30, Lewis re-converted to Christianity, becoming "a very ordinary layman of the Church of England". His conversion had a profound effect on his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.

Tolkien noted that some of his onomatopoeia influenced names in Lewis' works, including [[Numenor|Numinor]] (''That Hideous Strength''), [[Eldar|Eldil]] (''Out of the Silent Planet'') and [[Tuor|Tur]] and [[Idril|Tinidril]] (''Perelandra'').<ref>{{L|276}}</ref>
