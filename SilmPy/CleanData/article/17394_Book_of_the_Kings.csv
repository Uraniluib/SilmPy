The '''Book of the Kings''' was a record of the histories of all the [[Kings of Gondor]] and their families.

After [[Ber√∫thiel]] was exiled from [[Gondor]], her husband, King [[Tarannon Falastur]], had her name erased from the Book of the Kings. Nevertheless, she and her cats were still remembered by the [[Men]] of Gondor centuries later.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note 7</ref>
