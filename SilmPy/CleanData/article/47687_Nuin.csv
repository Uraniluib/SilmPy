'''Nuin''' was one of the [[Hisildi]], the [[Dark Elves]] who were ruled by the mysterious [[Sprites|fay]] known as [[Th√ª|Tu or Tuvon]] in the early writings of ''[[The Book of the Lost Tales]]''.

== History ==
Nuin is said to be very wise and loved to travel with his folk. Once he wandered far to the east of [[Palisor]] until curiosity led him to a strange place, with a mountainous wall. He found a passage which led to a valley inside a mountainous circle, [[Murmenalda]], the Vale of Sleep. There he saw sleeping forms, others alone, other entangled into the arms of others. Frightened, he went back to Tu and told his tale, and Tu replied him that they were the [[Men|Younger]] [[Children of Iluvatar]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>

The story, known as "Gilfanon's Tale", stops and its development is known only from outlines. According to them, Tu warned Nuin that it was not yet the time of Men to wake yet as they needed light, but Nuin visited the valley often and pondered on the figures. Accidentaly he stumbled against a sleeper who stirred, and then he was overcome with curiosity and awoke the first pair of [[Men]], [[Ermon]] and [[Elmir]], right before the first rising of the [[Sun]] from the [[West]]. Men were dumb and frightened, but Nuin taught them speech, some [[Ilkorin]] tongue, and thus was the '''Father of Speech'''. In another note, Nuin fights alongside Ermon in a fight against [[Fangli]] but he is killed by [[Goblins]], a result of the betraying of Men.<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] laments that "Gilfanon's Tale" remained unfinished and wondered whether his father consciously rejected the concepts of the story outright, or left it on hiatus, until his ideas were replaced by those of the later ''[[Silmarillion]]'' ([[Of Men]]).
