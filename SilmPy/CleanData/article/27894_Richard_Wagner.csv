'''Wilhelm Richard Wagner''' ([[22 May]] [[1813]]  – [[13 February]] [[1883]]) was a German composer, conductor, theatre director and essayist, primarily known for his operas.

Tolkien seems to have been well acquainted with the works of Wagner. Together with his friends in the [[Kolbítar]] Club, Tolkien studied the works of Wagner during the late 1920s.<ref>[[Andrew Lazo]], "Gathered Round Northern Fires: The Imaginative Impact of the Kolbítar", in ''Chance 2004''</ref> Another member of the club, [[C.S. Lewis]], was an avid fan of Wagner, and collected recordings of Wagner, owned illustrations by [[wikipedia: Arthur Rackham|Arthur Rackham]] (a British illustrator, often depicting scenes from the works of Wagner), dreamt about turning the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' into prose, and took Tolkien to London to see a staging of the ''Ring''.<ref>{{HM|Inklings}}, p. 56 (note 1)</ref><ref>[[Andrew Lazo]], "Gathered Round Northern Fires: The Imaginative Impact of the Kolbítar", p.197</ref><ref>Christine Chism, "Middle-Earth, the Middle Ages, and the Aryan Nation: Myth and History in World War II", in ''Chance 2003'', p.75f</ref> During the 1930s, Lewis and Tolkien apparently began working on a translation of ''[[Die Walküre]]''.<ref>Stefan Arvidsson,  ''[[Draksjukan|Draksjukan.

In the scholarly study of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], Wagner is mostly mentioned in the context of the apparent similarities between ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Wagner's tetralogy of epic operas based on the Norse sagas and the Nibelungenlied, and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
