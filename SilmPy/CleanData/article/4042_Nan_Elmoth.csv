'''Nan Elmoth''' was a forest in [[East Beleriand]] east of [[Doriath]], south of the River [[Celon]], and north of [[Estolad]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> One of the two roads that the [[Dwarves]] took from [[Blue Mountains]] towards Beleriand passed near Nan Elmoth. There the trees grew to be the tallest and darkest in Beleriand, blocking the sun entirely from the forest floor.<ref name="Maeglin">{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

[[Melian]] met [[Thingol]] in Nan Elmoth, and stayed motionless for years while the trees grew around them. When they woke up, they founded the realm of Doriath.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref> Nan Elmoth was held to be part of Doriath, and [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] paid Thingol with the black sword [[Anglachel]] as a fee for living there.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> Eöl dwelt with his wife [[Aredhel]] and their son [[Maeglin]].<ref name="Maeglin"/>

==Etymology==
''[[Nan]]'' means "valley" in [[Sindarin]].

[[Robert Foster]] translates the whole name as "Valley of star-dusk" (''[[elen|el]]'' + ''moth'' "stardusk").<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 278</ref>
