'''The Roll''' was a list of names created by [[Hobbits]] following the [[Battle of Bywater]]. The Roll contained all those hobbits who fought in the Battle of Bywater, with Captains [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] appearing at the top of the list. Other Hobbits who fought were [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Farmer Cotton]], [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom]], [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]] and [[Bowman Cotton|Nick Cotton]].

In latter years the Roll was learned by heart by Shire-historians, and the rise of fame and fortune of the [[Cotton Family|Cottons]] dates from this time.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
