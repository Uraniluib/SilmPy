'''Laurelin''' ({{IPA|[ˈlaʊrelin]}}) was the '''Golden Tree''' of [[Aman]], the female mate of [[Telperion]], and the younger of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was collected by [[Varda]].<ref name=BegDays/>

==History==
Laurelin was created by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Yavanna]] and [[Nienna]] on the hill of [[Ezellohar]] where she shed their light on the realm of the [[Valar]] in the long years before the making of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. Laurelin, the youngest of the two, flowered second and bloomed during the latter part of each Valian day. <ref name=BegDays>{{S|1}}</ref>

She was destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] who used the giant spider spirit [[Ungoliant]] to his evil purpose during the theft of the [[Silmarils]], which caused the [[Darkening of Valinor]]. Through the power of Nienna and Yavanna, though, Laurelin produced a single fiery fruit before she died. This golden fire was set in a vessel made by [[Aulë]] and his people, and steered into the sky by the [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Arien]], making the [[Sun]].<ref name=OfSun>{{S|11}}</ref>
