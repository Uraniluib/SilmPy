'''Damrod''' was a [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger of Ithilien]].

==History==
Damrod was the companion of [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]] and a trusted guard of [[Faramir]].  Together he and Mablung watched [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] during the ambush of the [[Haradrim|Men of Harad]] in [[Ithilien]].  While they waited before the battle Damrod told the hobbits of the Enemy's dealings with the Southrons.  Damrod had little hope; he believed "the days of [[Gondor]] are numbered, and the walls of [[Minas Tirith]] are doomed".<ref name="herbs"/>

After the ambush Damrod and Mablung continued to serve as watch-guards over the hobbits as the Rangers journeyed to [[Henneth Annûn]].<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>
