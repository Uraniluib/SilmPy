'''Wolf-riders''' were mostly [[Orcs]], who rode [[wolves]].

Orcs used wolves as steeds back in the [[First Age]],<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> as well as [[wargs]] well into the [[Third Age]], when wolf-riders came in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|17}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Saruman]] employed "Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil [[Men]]"<ref group=note>[[Ã‰omer]]'s reference seems to suggest that Wolf-riders are not necessarily Orcs, nor Men, making their identity uncertain. Cf. {{HM|Guide}}.</ref> to harass [[Rohan]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>  Before the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], scouts reported that Wolf-riders were roaming the valley about [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>
