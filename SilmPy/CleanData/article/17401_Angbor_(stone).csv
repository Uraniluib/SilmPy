The '''Angbor''' was a stone in the forests of [[Brethil]].
==History==
The Angbor was the place where trials of law were held by the [[Haladin]]. During such trials, the [[Chieftain of the Haladin]] or [[Haldad]] would sit on the stone itself. During the trial of [[Húrin]] on the charge of assaulting the Haldad took place and turned into a riot, largely ending the Haladin's existence as a coherent people.
