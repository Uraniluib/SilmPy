The '''Constellations''' of [[Arda]] were formations of [[stars]] made by [[Varda]] to signal the [[Elves]] to [[Valinor]]. In a council of the [[Valar]], [[Mandos]] foresaw the coming of the Elves and spoke: "the Firstborn shall come in the darkness, and shall look first upon the stars - to Varda [[A Elbereth Gilthoniel|ever shall they call at need]]."<ref name="Beginning">{{S|1}}</ref>

==Creation==
After pondering at the words of Mandos, Varda decided to make new stars and also "many other of the ancient stars she gathered together and set as signs in the heavens of Arda".<ref name="Elves">{{S|3}}</ref>

Thus were formed the constellations [[Wilwarin]], [[Telumendil]], [[Soronúmë]], [[Anarríma]], and as the most important ones, [[Menelmacar]] and [[Valacirca]]. Of the two last ones the former was meant to forebode the [[Final Battle|Dagor Dagorath]] and the latter to challenge [[Morgoth|Melkor]] in the Northern skies and to act as the sign of doom of the Valar.

According to the ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]'' the making of the stars (and constellations) happened 1000-1050 [[Valian Years]] after the first flowering of the [[Two Trees]].<ref name="Annals">{{HM|MR}}, "[[The Annals of Aman]]"</ref>

==Evolution of the story==

The constellations played their part already in the very early phase of the mythology of Arda in ''The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr''.<ref name="LT2" />

There the Elves are first brought to Valinor during the captivity of Melko and [[Varda]], in order to commemorate the coming of the [[Eldar]], made new stars mingling the radiance of the [[Telperion|Silver Tree]] that was stored in a basin with molten silver in Aulë's workshop. Of the constellations only the "[[Seven Stars]]" is mentioned, and its birth is ascribed either to [[Aulë]] or (in a separate note) to Varda.<ref name="LT2">{{HM|LT1}}, "The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr"</ref> Later, in ''The Tale of the Sun and the Moon'' there is a reference to [[Telimektar]] and in the end of the Tale the [[Moon]] is told to beg the "starry mariners flee before him and the constellate lamps go out".<ref name="LT1">{{HM|LT1}}, "The Tale of the Sun and Moon"</ref>

The development of Telimektar, from a [[Valar|Vala]], son of [[Tulkas]], to the constellation now known as Orion followed its own path, separate from the story of the making of the constellations until it was abandoned. Only in the latest versions of the Silmarillion, Telimektar was taken to the company of other constellations with another name and character, [[Menelmacar]] the Swordsman. 

In the next phase, written between 1926-30,<ref name="SM1">{{HM|SM}}, "The Sketch of the Mythology"</ref> the making of the stars was already contemporary with the awakening of the Elves, but the constellations were not mentioned. Only in ''The Quenta'',<ref name="SM2">{{HM|SM}}, "The Quenta"</ref> written in [[1930]], Varda made the stars ''before'' the coming of the Eldar and also creates The Great Bear, also mentioned in ''The Earliest Annals of Valinor'',<ref name="SM3">{{HM|SM}}, "The Earliest Annals of Valinor"</ref> at the [[Valian Years|Valian Year]] 2000 (later changed to 1900).

In ''The Later Annals of Valinor'',<ref name="LR">{{HM|LR}}, "The Later Annals of Valinor"</ref> written between 1930 and the end of 1937, in the entry of [[Valian year]] 1900 Varda is told to have begun "the fashioning of the stars" and in V. Y. 1950 she made the [[Valacirca|Sickle of the Gods]]. No other constellations are mentioned.

The origin of the stars is again changed in the ''Annals of Aman'',<ref name="Annals" /> which were written after [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] finished ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Here, the stars are told to have been made in V. Y. 1000-1050: first, [[Menelmacar]] (now set apart from the story of [[Telimektar]]), and after that, in V. Y. 1050, [[Valacirca]]

Finally, in ''The Later Quenta Silmarillion I'',<ref name="LQS">{{HM|MR}}, "The Later Quenta Silmarillion I"</ref> also written after the completion of ''The Lord of the Rings'', all constellations now known are listed and the Elves awake just "when first Menelmakar strode up the sky". The printed text in the Silmarillion does not essentially deviate from this except in wording and omission of some details.
