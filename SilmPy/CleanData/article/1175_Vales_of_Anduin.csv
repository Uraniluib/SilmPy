The '''Vales of Anduin''' was the collective name for the large valley of the [[Anduin]], specifically the part east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. It is where the [[Gladden River]] meets the Anduin and form the [[Gladden Fields]]. Throughout history, it had been occupied by [[Elves]], [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]].
==History==
In the [[First Age]], the [[Teleri]] who were too afraid to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] stopped there. They became the [[Nandor]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> Later they were joined by the [[Avari]], specifically the [[Penni]], who came west. But eventually some of them left the Vales for the west. 

The [[Silvan Elves]] established realms on both sides of the Vales, and their remnants were the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] or the [[Galadhrim]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref>

Near the end of the First Age, the Vales were occupied by [[Edain]], the ancestors of the [[Northmen]]. Those were in confederation with the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] and the [[Longbeards]] and provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items. This cooperation continued until the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], when the Dwarves closed themselves in their mountains and the Men were scattered.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Relationns}}</ref>

After the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains]], some [[Northmen]] were gathereed under the leadership of [[Marhwini]] son of [[Marhari]], who led them north between Anduin and Mirkwood, eventually settling in the [[Vales of Anduin]] between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders'', note 8</ref>  They were joined by many fugitives who came through [[Mirkwood]].  This was the birth of the [[Éothéod]].

Sometime during the [[Third Age]] the [[Hobbits]] migrated to the Vales of Anduin from an unknown earlier location; the Vales are their first known location before eventually the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] fell on [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]]. The [[Harfoots]] left for the west in {{TA|1050}} and begin their [[Wandering Days]]. When [[Angmar]] threatened [[Eriador]], some of the [[Stoors]] would return to the east and around {{TA|1356}} settled in the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Once a fair and fertile land, it became a dangerous area, beleaguered by the creatures of the [[Necromancer#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] at [[Dol Guldur]]. However, when the evil [[Angmar|Kingdom of Angmar]] was destroyed in {{TA|1975}}, freeing up land to the north, [[Frumgar]] led the Éothéod to the vale between the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]],<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> where they built [[Framsburg|a city]].

In the later years before the [[War of the Ring]], the Vales were inhabited by the [[Beornings]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> During [[Grimbeorn]]'s time, the [[High Pass]] and the [[Ford of Carrock]] were kept open and no [[Orcs|Orc]] or [[Wargs|Wolf]] dared to enter his land.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

==Climate==
[[Firs]], [[strawberries]] and [[wild berries]]{{fact}} (cf.) grew in the Vales.
