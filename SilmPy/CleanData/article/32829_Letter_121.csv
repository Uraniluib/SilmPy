==Summary==
Tolkien had referred to further "legends of the [[Little Kingdom]]" in the Foreword to of ''Farmer Giles of Ham'' in case he ever wrote more.  But [[Georgius]] and [[Suet]]<ref group="note">A story about the son of Giles and his servant, respectively.</ref> remained only a sketch and it was difficult to recapture the spirit of the former days.  But perhaps when ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (nearly finished in fair copy form) was done he could do something.<ref group="note">No sequel was ever written.</ref>
