'''Nan-tathren''', the "'''Land of Willows'''", was a region in [[Beleriand]]. It was located where the River [[Narog]] met the great River [[Sirion]], a little to the north of the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref name=S14/>
==History==
Famed for its [[willows]] and its flowered meadows, Nan-tathren was a desolate land.<ref name=S14>{{S|14}}</ref> The region played little part in the history of [[Arda]], and was perhaps inhabited by [[Ents]]<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/The_History_of_Ents.html#FA|articlename=History of the Ents|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|website=Lalaith}}</ref>. 

After [[Morgoth]]'s triumph in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], his [[Orcs]] and [[wolves]] are said to have roamed even the distant southern lands of Nan-tathren and [[Ossiriand]], causing none of the [[Free peoples]] in Beleriand to be secure.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

The refugees from [[Gondolin]], led by [[Tuor]], rested in Nan-tathren for a while on their long journey south from their city's ruin. They were healed of their wounds and sorrows by [[Ulmo]]'s power, which was strong in the land from his presence in the River Sirion. There was awakened the sea-longing of Tuor and his son [[Eärendil]].<ref>{{S|23}}</ref>

In the late [[Third Age]], [[Treebeard]] remembered Nan-tathren and sang about "''the willow-meads of Tasarinan''" to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]].<ref name=Tree/>

==Etymology==

''Nan-tathren'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, meaning "vale of willows" or "land of willows".<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 384</ref>

==Names==

In [[Quenya]], the region was called '''''Tasarinan''''' or '''''Nan-tasarion''''',<ref name=Tree>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> meaning "willow-vale".<ref name=RC/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' the 'Land of Willows' is located in roughly the same place as in the later geography of the [[legendarium]], but [[Tuor]] visits it before, as well as after, his sojourn in [[Gondolin]]. Its beauty caused Tuor to tarry there longer than [[Ulmo]] had purposed — only leaving when the Vala appeared to him directly and order him to seek Gondolin. Following the sack of the city the refugees came to the Land of Willows and stayed there several years, until Tuor's 'sea-longing' drove them on to the Mouths of Sirion.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>

Yet another detail about this region is given in these early version of the tales: the Land of Willows is said to be the place were [[butterflies]] of all kinds came into the world, and they remained common there during the [[First Age]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 154</ref>
