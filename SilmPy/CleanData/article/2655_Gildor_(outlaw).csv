'''Gildor''' (died {{FA|460}}<ref>{{GA|167}}</ref>) was a member of [[Barahir's Outlaw Band]].

==History==
Gildor fought in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] under the command of [[Barahir]]. He was part of a small group of men loyal to their lord that survived.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> The survivors formed a small band and lived as [[Barahir's Outlaw Band|outlaws]] in [[Dorthonion]], near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. 

They lived in hiding for some time, until [[Morgoth]]'s agents captured [[Gorlim]] and coerced him into giving the location of their hideaway. [[Orcs]] were sent to raid it, and succeeded. Gildor and the other outlaws were killed. Only [[Beren]] survived, as he had been away on an errand.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>
