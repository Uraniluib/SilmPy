The word is obviously [[Quenya]], but of uncertain etymology.

[[Helge Fauskanger]] notes that Tolkien's wording does not make clear whether the word describes the "last [year] of a century" or a translation of "century" itself.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref>
