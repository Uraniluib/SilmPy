{{Pronounce|Carn Dum.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Carn Dûm''' was the capital and chief fortress of the [[Witch-king]]'s realm of [[Angmar]].<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Carn Dûm''</ref>  It was located at the western end of the [[Mountains of Angmar]], the north-western extension of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>
 
==History==
Around {{TA|1300}} the chief of the [[Nazgûl]] came north to found the realm of [[Angmar]],<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> seeing hope in the disunion of [[Arnor]] while the southern kingdom of [[Gondor]] remained powerful.  The Witch-king, as he became known, established Carn Dûm as his capital and populated it with [[Men of Darkness]], [[Orcs]], and other fell creatures.
 
Allying with the [[Hill-men]] of [[Rhudaur]], the Witch-king in Carn Dûm sent forces that resisted the claim of [[Argeleb I]] of [[Arthedain]] of lordship over all of the former lands of [[Arnor]].<ref name="North">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>  Clashes resulted and in {{TA|1356|n}} Argeleb was slain.<ref name="TA"/> [[Arveleg I]], the son of Argeleb, with strength from [[Cardolan]] and [[Lindon]], repelled Rhudaur and Angmar from the [[Weather Hills]] and established an uneasy, fortified frontier.
 
In {{TA|1409|n}} a stronger host commanded from Carn Dûm invaded [[Cardolan]], surrounded [[Weathertop]], and killed Arveleg.  Again a coalition of Arthedain (now ruled by [[Araphor]], son of Arveleg I) and Lindon contained the menace.
 
The kingdom of [[Arthedain]] perished in the [[Fall of Fornost]] in {{TA|1974|n}}.<ref name="North"/>  However, in {{TA|1975|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the Witch-king's forces were driven north-east after the [[Battle of Fornost]] by the cavalry of Gondor and destroyed.  [[Glorfindel of Rivendell|Glorfindel]] drove off the Witch-king himself.
 
The host of Gondor left no Man or Orc alive west of the Mountains.<ref name="North"/>  On the eastern side in {{TA|1977|n}} [[Frumgar]] led the [[Éothéod]] into the North<ref name="TA"/> and they drove the last remnants of [[Angmar]] away.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>  At this time then Carn Dûm was wholly abandoned. While it is possible that Carn Dûm was repopulated after {{TA|2480|n}}, when Orcs began making secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains,<ref name="TA"/> its name was never mentioned again in any histories.

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''Carn Dûm'' is uncertain and it could be any from the [[Elvish]] or [[Mannish]] languages.

''[[Dûm]]'' is a [[Khuzdul]] word meaning "halls, mansions". The name Carn Dûm therefore could be [[Khuzdul]] (suggested by its proximity to nearby [[Gundabad]]) but [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] used ''K'' for this language instead of ''C''.<ref>{{App|E1}}</ref>

In ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'', "Carndoom" appears as an early name of [[Dimrill Dale]] which, according to Tolkien, means "Red Valley". This corresponds with [[Sindarin]] ''carn'' "red" and ''tûm'' "valley".<ref>{{RS|4XXIVN}} (note 13, p. 433)</ref> 

[[David Salo]] favours the Sindarin interpretation of "red valley", and provides the name as an example of the few Sindarin phrases where the adjective ''precedes'' the noun (others being [[Sarn Athrad]] and [[Sarn Gebir]]).<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 102</ref> Otherwise, neither words ''carn'' and ''dûm'' have been attested (''carn'' could be a short form of ''[[caran]]'' possibly also seen in ''[[carcharoth|'''Car'''charoth]]'', "red maw")

Another suggestion, is that the name roughly translates as "mountain fortress" in [[wikipedia:Gaelic|Gaelic]];<ref>[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/carndum.html Carn Dûm] at the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]]</ref> although Tolkien uses [[Celtic]] elements for some translated [[Mannish]] names, this would have been the only instance where he uses Gaelic. It is unknown whether this is just coincidence or not.
