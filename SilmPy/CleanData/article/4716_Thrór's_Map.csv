'''Thrór's Map''' is a map that proved important in the retaking of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

==History==
[[File:Audrey Corman - Thror's Map.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Thror's Map'' by [[Audrey Corman]].]]
As was traditional among the [[Dwarves]], it was drawn with East at the top of the map and showed the [[Lonely Mountain]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the [[River Running|Running]] River that flowed from it, and the lands about. It also contained mention of a [[Back Door|secret entrance]] to the Mountain, and (written in secret [[Moon-letters]]) instructions as to how it might be opened.

In his old age, Thrór set out to wander the lands of [[Middle-earth]], but before departing he gave the heirlooms of his house to his son Thráin, including his Map. Years later, Thráin too set out into Middle-earth, seeking to recover Erebor himself, and taking with him the Map to guide his way. He was captured in the Wild by the servants of [[Sauron]], but Sauron captured Thráin for one of the [[Seven Rings|Seven]] [[Rings of Power]] he bore, and so overlooked the Map he carried too. This proved to be a serious oversight, because [[Gandalf]] secretly entered Sauron's lair at [[Dol Guldur]] while Thráin was a prisoner there, and managed to escape with the Map and the key that opened the secret door.

Using Thrór's Map, his grandson [[Thorin]] was able to lead [[Thorin and Company|a small group of Dwarves]] (and one [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], a certain [[Bilbo Baggins]]) on his own quest to refound the ancient Dwarf-realm. Through many adventures, they were able to recover Erebor and bring about the destruction of Smaug, dealing Sauron a serious reverse.

==Runes==
The Map is decorated with [[Old English]] [[Runes]] which read a modern English text; this displays [[Westron]] of the [[Third Age]] written in [[cirth]] ([[Angerthas Erebor]]) as used by the [[Dwarves of Erebor]].

The small text on the left, below the hand, reads.

The [[moon-letters]] read by Elrond are visible in the sketch by Tolkien and read:

Stand by the grey s<br>

ocks and the setting s<br>
un with the last light<br>
of Durin's day will sh<br>
