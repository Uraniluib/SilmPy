While all races undoubtedly had rope makers, in [[Lothl√≥rien]] the [[Elves]] used ''[[hithlain]]'' to make a superior rope that was grey and silky to the touch.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref> In [[the Shire]], some ancestors of [[Samwise Gamgee]] took up the occupation of rope making and even used the word "Roper" as a surname:<ref name>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
