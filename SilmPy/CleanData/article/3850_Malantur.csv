'''Malantur''' was the great-grandson of [[Tar-Amandil]], descended from Tar-Amandil's second son, [[Eärendur (son of Tar-Amandil)|Eärendur]].<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref>

The original [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] royal law of succession stated that the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] must go to a male heir, either the King's son or, if he had no son, to the nearest kinsman of male descent. During Malantur's life the King was [[Tar-Aldarion]], his only child being a daughter, and as the nearest kinsman of male descent, Malantur was the King's presumptive heir. 

However, in {{SA|892}} Tar-Aldarion changed the law of succession so that the eldest child of the King, whether a man or a woman, should receive the sceptre.  He then named his daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]] as his heir. The royal Council advised the King to amend the rule such that a female heir could refuse the sceptre, in which case the heir would become the nearest male kinsman of either male or female descent.  Tar-Aldarion agreed to this change, so if Ancalimë had refused the sceptre it would have been her cousin [[Soronto]] who would have become the ruler of Númenor.  Thus Malantur was denied the chance to become Númenor's seventh King.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Though he left descendants, nothing of their lives was recorded.<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Malantur's name is difficult to translate, but may incorporate the [[Quenya]] root for 'gold', ''[[mal-]]''. The stem ''[[-ntur]]'', 'commander', makes up the last part of his name.
