Father '''Robert Patrick Ruthven Murray''' (b. [[8 June]] [[1925]]-[[24 April]] [[2018]]) , an English Roman Catholic theologian and grandson of Sir [[wikipedia:James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] (the founder of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), is on the Faculty of [[wikipedia:Heythrop College|Heythrop College]] in Oxfordshire and London since 1963. He became a Jesuit in 1949 and was ordained in 1959.

A personal friend of the Tolkien family (a friendship which contributed to his conversion to Roman Catholicism) since 1944, Murray was entrusted by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to proofread drafts and manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Tolkien and Murray corresponded frequently, especially on matters of religion, and several letters from Murray were published in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' (letters [[Letter 142|142]], [[Letter 156|156]], [[Letter 209|209]]) 

On [[1 August]] [[1959]] Tolkien served Murray's first Mass, and on [[6 September]] [[1973]], four days of the death of Tolkien, he assisted in a requiem Mass for Tolkien in the Church of St Anthony of Padua in Headington, Oxford.

During the [[Tolkien Centenary Conference]] in Oxford (1992), Father Murray gave the sermon preach at the Thanksgiving service.
