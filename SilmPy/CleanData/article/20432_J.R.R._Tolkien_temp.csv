Professor Dr. '''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien''' [[wikipedia:CBE|CBE]] ([[1892]] - [[1973]]) is the subject of [[Tolkien Gateway: About|Tolkien Gateway]]. His life, his works, his family: everything about the man whom fans have named affectionately '''the Professor''' can be found here. 

Besides creating [[Arda]], the [[Little Kingdom]], and many other wonderful worlds, Tolkien's reading of [[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|Beowulf]] was groundbreaking, and stands as ''the'' interpretation of the epic poem to this day.<ref name="FaHPre">J.R.R.

===Names===
====John====
The name ''John'' was a custom in the [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] family. It was usually given to the eldest son of the eldest son. Tolkien's father, [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur]], was the first son of [[John Benjamin Tolkien|John Benjamin]]'s second marriage; the first son of his first marriage, John, died with only three daughters. As of that moment, the name ''John'' went to Arthur's descendants.<ref name="L309">J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 309]] (dated [[2 January|January 2]], [[1969]])</ref> It passed to Tolkien's first son, [[John Tolkien|John]], who became a priest and left no children,<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', page 202</ref> so the name ''John'' has effectively lost its hereditary signififance.

The name, though Romish in nature, had at first no religious connotations. However, because his birthday ([[3 January|January 3]]) was the [[wikipedia:Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of [[wikipedia:John the Evangelist|John the Evangelist]], Tolkien chose him as his patron.<ref name="L309"/> 
====Ronald====
Arthur Tolkien's first choice for his eldest son's second child was Benjamin, after his father. Tolkien's mother, [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel]], who was confident she would receive a daughter, chose ''Rosalind''. This would become ''Ronald'' when the child turned out to be a boy.<ref name="L309"/> Tolkien often used this name as his first name; most of his letters to [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]] were signed ''Ronald'', or simply ''R.''.<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 1]], note 7 (dated October [[1914]])</ref>  
====Reuel====
Despite its [[wikipedia:Raguel (name)|obvious biblical connotations]], the name ''Reuel'' does not come from any of the people mentioned in the Bible; instead, it was the surname of a friend of John Benjamin.<ref name="L309"/> He gave it to his son Arthur, and both his sons, John and [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] had it. Even most their male children and grandchildren have it. Though this family friend was never identified, Tolkien recalled the name being of Norman origin.<ref name="L309"/> In this light, it might be an early anglification of the surname ''Rouel'', which means "(maker of) small wheels/circular objects".<ref>Marie-Thérèse Morlet, ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de famille'' (1991), translated from the French: "''en général « petite roue », a désigné en anc[ien] fr[ançais] et moy[en] fr[ançais] différents objets en forme de roue, peut être un surnom de fabricant.''"</ref> The "biblical" ''Reuel'' means "Friend of God".<ref>[[wikipedia:Patrick Hanks|Patrick Hanks]],  Kate Hardcastle, Flavia Hodges, ''A Dictionary of First Names'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2003)</ref>

:[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2710745/ Ian Bellman] plays Tolkien in this documentary about convinced atheist Sigmund Freud and influential Christian writer (though not so at first) [[C.S. Lewis]]. Tolkien is introduced in a segment recounting Lewis' first experience of faith, a walk at [[Addison Walk]] the two had with [[Hugo Dyson]]. Tolkien is further shown in group shots of the [[Inklings]], though he does not have any lines.<ref>''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433436/ The Question of God: Sigmund Freud & C.S.

'''2009: ''[[Tolkien's Monsters]]'':'''
:Two uncredited actors portray Tolkien in this episode; one for the War years (aged 24) and one for the years beyond (aged 36).<ref>History Channel, ''Clash of the Gods'', "[[Tolkien's Monsters]]"</ref> The latter sports a mustache while the former is clean shaven; an inversion of history. During the war, Tolkien had a mustache, but later images show he shaved it off.
