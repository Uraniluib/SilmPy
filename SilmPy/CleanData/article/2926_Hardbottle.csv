'''Hardbottle''' was a settlement of [[Hobbits]] located in the stony northern section of [[the Shire]].<ref group=note>The town was too far north to appear on the map "[[A Part of the Shire]]".</ref>

The [[Bracegirdle Family]] had their roots in Hardbottle.  When [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] was released from the [[Lockholes]] of [[Michel Delving]] after the [[Battle of Bywater]] she (having been a Bracegirdle before her marriage) returned to her family in Hardbottle.  She did so because she had lost the last of her family, her son [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]], and she gave [[Bag End]] back to [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name means "rocky (hard) large dwelling", because it is excavated in or built of stone of the rocky North Farthing.  The element ''bottle'' and ''bold'' ([[Old English]] ''botl'', from which the verb "build" is derived) is a real-life English place-name element meaning "(large) dwelling".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref>

Based on this, [[David Salo]] suggests that the name represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Heardbotl'' "hard (stony) dwelling".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
