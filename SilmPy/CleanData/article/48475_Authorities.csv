{{quote|The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere ‘question’ and not a ‘riddle’ according to the strict rules of the Game.|<ref>{{FR|Finding}}</ref>}}
The '''Authorities''' are a group mentioned fleetingly in [[The Lord of the Rings Prologue]], regarding the [[Riddle-game]] between [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Gollum]].

Considering that the rules of the Game were sacred, it's possible that the Authorities was another name for the [[Valar]].
