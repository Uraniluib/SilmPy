'''''The Children's Treasury of Literature in Colour''''' is a collection of children's stories. The anthology includes the chapter "[[An Unexpected Party]]" from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', illustrated by Robert J. Lee.

Tolkien received copy of the book from [[Joy Hill]] in the beginning of January [[1967]], and [[Letter to Joy Hill (5 January 1967)|wrote to her on 5 January]] that while he considered "a great many of the illustrations" to be "very good", Robert J. Lee's ''Hobbit'' illustrations appeared to him as "vulgar, stupid and entirely out of keeping with the text".<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 421</ref> He also wrote that he will give the book to his grandson, [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s son [[Simon Tolkien|Simon]] (aged 8).<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 685</ref>
