The '''North Germanic languages''', '''Norse''' or '''Scandinavian languages''' make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages, a sub-family of the Indo-European languages, along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages like [[Gothic]]. 

In a letter to [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote that: 

{{quote|The [[Dalish|language of Dale]] and the [[Long Lake]] would, if it appeared, be represented as more or less Scandinavian in character; but it is only represented by a few names, especially those of the Dwarves that came from that region. These are all Old Norse Dwarf-names.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{L|144}}</ref>}}

Most of the non-English names in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' are Norse (mostly from a list of Dwarves found in ''Voluspa'' and the ''Gylfaginning'')<ref name="intro">''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]''</ref> although anglicized, such as [[Gandalf|Gandalfr]], [[Durin|Durinn]], [[Dwalin|Dvalinn]], [[Thrór|Þrór]], [[Oakenshield|Eikinskjaldi]], [[Arkenstone|Jarknasteinn]], [[Beorn]], [[Bard]], [[Smaug]] and [[Golfimbul]].

In the backstory developed for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien explained that [[Durin's Folk]], after migrating to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], adopted the language of Dale for their names when interacting with [[Men]] because their secretive nature prevented them from using [[Khuzdul]]<ref>{{HM|AF}}</ref><ref>{{HM|PM}} p.304</ref>. Names in ''The Lord of the Ring'' like [[Gimli]], [[Narvi]] and [[Tom Bombadil|Forn]] are also Norse.

Tolkien never gives the "original" Dalish forms, however the Norse translations fit conveniently their meaning; for example Dwarf relations - like father-son or brothers- have rhyming or similar names (cf. [[Glóin]]-[[Gróin]]-[[Óin]], [[Thrór]]-[[Frór]]-[[Grór]], [[Fíli]]-[[Kíli]] etc)<ref name="intro"/>  possibly reflecting a similar relationship in their original forms.

Norse used [[Runes]] for a writing system, however Tolkien in ''The Hobbit'' used [[Old English]] runes.
