==Summary==
This letter was sent from Rugeley Camp in Staffordshire. Tolkien was in military training there, and wrote ''[[Kortirion among the Trees]]''. He told about the cold weather and about sending [[T.C.B.S.]] a copy of ''Kortirion''.  He decided to send Edith his neat pencil copy and make the T.C.B.S. wait until he could make another.
