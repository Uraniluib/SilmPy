'''Cerin Amroth''' was a mound in the heart of the ancient land of [[Lothlórien]] on which grew two rings of trees and a great tree with a white [[flet]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref> 

The hill was originally piled after the first millennium of the [[Third Age]] to be used as an outlook post for the growing shadow of [[Dol Guldur]]. [[Amroth]], the [[king of Lórien]], later built a house on the flet to use as a home and the hill became named after him.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> However his house was not present centuries later, and the hill was covered with [[Elanor (flower)|elanor]] and [[niphredil]].<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 67</ref>

It was here that [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] betrothed centuries later, and where Arwen surrendered her life<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> in {{FoA|121}}.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>
