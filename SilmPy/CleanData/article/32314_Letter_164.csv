==Summary==
Tolkien complained of having more work that he could cope with, plus the work on Vol. III.<ref group=note>''[[The Return of the King]]''</ref>  He was feeling as flat as a burst tire but might revive if the final proofs of Vol. III arrived.  He had heard from booksellers that since there had been so long a delay the proper time for publication was in late September.

Tolkien thought that [[Allen and Unwin]] might now publish the "earlier history".<ref group=note>''The Silmarillion''</ref>  He believed that they were willing to envision a book about as long as Vol. I.<ref group=note>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''</ref>
