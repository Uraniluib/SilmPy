'''The Great River''' is the ninth and penultimate chapter of the second book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
The journey by boat down the [[Anduin]] was uneventful for some days. The [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company]] passed through barren lands laid by [[Sauron]] and came across no living things except black swans flying overhead. The company decided for the most part to follow [[Aragorn]] along the path to [[Mordor]] that he had recommended. [[Boromir]] disagreed, wanting to return to his home with the [[The One Ring|Ring]], because of the dream he had had. Aragorn and [[Legolas]] went on ahead to find a safe route past the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]]. They returned to tell the company that they must leave the river and go by road for a while.
