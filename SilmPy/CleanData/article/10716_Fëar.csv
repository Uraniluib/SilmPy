'''Fëar''' (a [[Quenya]] word; sing. '''''fëa'''''; the Sindarin equivalent is ''fae'') were the spirits or souls of incarnate creatures such as [[Elves]] and [[Men]]; they were one part of the makeup of these beings (the other part being the ''[[hröa]]'', or body). ''Fëar'' were sent into [[Eä]] directly by [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]]; they are indestructible and are unable to dominated by any force within Eä, unless they give consent.

The word ''fëar'' is only used in reference to souls whose natural state is to be incarnated; those spirits that do not require a ''hröa'' in order to be complete are called ''[[ëalar]]'' ("beings").

For a discussion on the relationship between the souls of the [[Incarnate|Incarnates]] and their bodies, see [[Fëa and hröa]].
