==Summary==
Tolkien tells [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]] that he arrived in [[Bournemouth]] safely, but he found he lost his bank card when he reached the Miramar Hotel. While Dr. Martin Tolhurst, a friend of Tolkien's, was searching for his wallet, the Miramar canceled his reservation, and made him a new one, from September 4th to September 11th. He would stay with the Tolhursts for the time being, and was looking forward to the extended holiday. He would like to visit [[Christopher Wiseman]], who was in Milford at the time. Tolhurst found the wallet; Tolkien had left it at ''The Red Lion'' in Salisbury. 
==Notes==
* Though Tolkien accepted the offer of the Miramar Hotel, he did not use it as he planned to stay there from [[4 September]]. Nor did he visit Christopher Wiseman. John Ronald Reuel Tolkien died on [[2 September]], 1973, in a private hospital. 
* Tolkien travelled to Bournemouth with a private driver, Mr. Causier. Since they stopped in Salisbury, they probably drove the [[Wikipedia:A420 road|A420]] and the [[Wikipedia:A338 road|A338]].
* It is not specified in what Milford Wiseman was, but presumably it was [[wikipedia:Milford on Sea|Milford on Sea]], the closest town called Milford.
