==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The special anniversary diary, commemorating 50 years since the first publication of The Lord of the Rings and featuring artwork by J.R.R. Tolkien himself.<br/><br/>This year’s Tolkien desk diary continues in a popular tradition yet this is a very special year, for 2005 is the 50th anniversary since the first publication of The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The Tolkien Diary 2005 features 13 paintings and illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, some of these not appearing in print for many years. The paintings are based on Tolkien’s classic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, and provide a fascinating insight into how Tolkien himself imagined the world of Middle-earth would look. The images are accompanied by informative text which explains how they relate to the story and offers information on their content and history.<br/><br/>Published to coincide with a special 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the diary (together with the calendar) will initiate the start of a big year for the Nation’s Favourite Big Read and Book of the Century.}}
