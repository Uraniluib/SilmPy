'''Amandil''' was the eighteenth and last [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]] in [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Elendil</ref>  In common with his ancestors, Amandil was the leader of the [[Faithful]], those [[Númenóreans]] who still revered the [[Valar]] in opposition to the [[King's Men]].  After the Downfall of Númenor, Amandil's son [[Elendil]] would found the Númenórean [[Realms in Exile]].

== History ==
When he was young Amandil was a great friend of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], who as King kept Amandil in his Council even though he was an Elf-friend.  Amandil also gained early fame as a mighty sea-captain, and was held in honour by many due to the high nobility of his house.

However, after Ar-Pharazôn sailed to [[Middle-earth]] and took [[Sauron]] prisoner, the supposed captive gradually turned the King to his will.  Seeing the favour bestowed upon Sauron, all of the King's counselors save Amandil began to fawn upon the former captive, who induced the King and his followers to begin worshiping [[Morgoth|Melkor]].  Amandil was dismissed from the Council and he withdrew to [[Rómenna]], where he secretly gathered all of the Faithful.

When Amandil became aware of the purpose of the King to assault [[Aman]] he was filled with dread.  He called his son Elendil to him and revealed his plan to sail into the West to seek aid from [[Manwë]].  Amandil made his preparations in secret lest dire punishment fall upon his house.  He counseled his son to prepare ships to lie in the haven of Rómenna to escape when they saw their time.  Upon his departure Amandil pretended to sail east before circling about to head west.  He took with him three trusted servants but he and they were never heard from again.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Amandil means "Devoted to [[Aman]]" in [[Quenya]] (from ''-[[dil]]'' = "friend, lover, devoted to").

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
[[Elentir]], intended to be a brother of Amandil, was a character developed but never fully adapted into the formal history of Númenor. In one version of the story of [[Ar-Pharazôn]], his future wife [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]], the daughter of the current king, was betrothed to Elentir. However, she fell desperately in love with Pharazôn and chose to become his queen when he took up the [[Sceptre of Númenor]]. This story is very different than the tale in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', where Ar-Pharazôn takes Míriel very much against her will in order to claim the Sceptre. In either case, Elentir disappeared before Nùmendil died, leaving Amandil as the [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]].<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>
