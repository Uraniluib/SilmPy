'''Remmirath''', or '''the Netted Stars''',<ref name="TiC">{{FR|I3}}</ref> was a constellation in the skies over [[Arda]].

==History==
Though not mentioned specifically, Remmirath's origin is likely the same to that of other constellations: it was created by [[Varda]] to signal the [[Elves]] to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> In the [[Third Age]], it could be clearly seen in the Eastern sky during the autumn.<ref name="TiC"/>

==Etymology==
''Remmirath'' is quite accurately translated with its [[Westron]] name ''the Netted Stars''. The word is composed of three elements: ''rem'', "mesh", ''[[mir]]'', "jewel", and the collective plural suffix ''[[-ath]]''. It has been translated as "group of gems in a net" and "group of jewels caught in a net".<ref name="VT42"/> Two other names were used for Pleiades at early stages of the [[legendarium]]: [[Gnomish]] ''Sithaloth'' or ''Sithaloctha'', which means "fly-cluster",<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 255</ref> and [[Qenya]] ''Itselokte'' of similar meaning.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 43</ref> 

==Inspiration==
Remmirath is identified as the constellation [[wikipedia:Pleiades|Pleiades]].<ref name="VT42">{{VT|42a}}, pp. 5-31</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 24</ref>
