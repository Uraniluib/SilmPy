'''Harad''' was the name of the immense lands to the South of [[Gondor]] and [[Mordor]]. It was inhabited by many different tribes called [[Haradrim]].

== History ==
[[File:John Howe - Icon Harad.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[John Howe]] - Harad War Icon]]

=== First Age ===
In the [[First Age]], the [[Drúedain]] migrated westward from [[Hildórien]] through Harad. Before reaching Harad's coastline, they turned northward into [[Ithilien]] and became the first Men to cross the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|12}}, 339-340.</ref>

=== Second Age ===
During the [[Second Age]], the Haradrim came in contact with [[Sauron]] and the [[Númenóreans]]. The Men of [[Númenor]] explored the coasts of [[Middle-earth]], including the coast lands of Harad. In the 9th century of the Second Age, the great mariner [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] explored the coast of Harad far to the south and was nearly shipwrecked.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

The Númenóreans, who had explored and colonized the Harad coastlines, initially benefited the people in the lands they explored by teaching them many things about agriculture and craftsmanship.<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref> The Númenóreans made settlements on the southern coasts, including the Havens of [[Umbar]] where they built a great fortress in {{SA|2280|n}}.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

After the reign of [[Tar-Ciryatan]], the Númenóreans began to set themselves up as lords in Middle-earth as they demanded tribute of goods and wealth, causing the oppression of the Haradrim. [[Sauron]] did not at first dare to extend his power to the coast where the Númenóreans held power. But after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]] and the emergence of the [[Nazgûl]], Sauron began to attack the Númenórean settlements on the coast.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

[[Ar-Pharazôn]] of Númenor landed at [[Umbar]] in {{SA|3261|n}}<ref name="SA"/> with a great fleet and the people on the coasts fled before them. Sauron's forces refused to fight and he allowed himself to be taken to Númenor where he corrupted the King and his followers. Under Ar-Pharazon, the Númenóreans made war on the Men of Middle-earth, enslaving them and using them for human sacrifices.<ref name="Akallabeth"/>

The Númenóreans who lived in Harad survived the destruction of Númenor in {{SA|3319|n}}.<ref name="SA"/> They became known as the [[Black Númenóreans]] because they remained under the influence of Sauron.<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> Some of them "rose to great power amongst the Haradrim".<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

=== Third Age ===
[[Image:Jan Pospisil - Haradrim Camp.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Jan Pospíšil - ''Haradrim Camp'']]
For many centuries of the [[Third Age]], many Haradrim were still ruled by Black Númenórean Lords, or further north by the Kings of [[Gondor]]. Ultimately the Harad fell under the influence of [[Mordor]] for much of the Age.

[[Near Harad]] later formed an alliance—or maybe even a coalition of some sort—with the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], and was involved in a series of continual battles with Gondor over [[South Gondor]] or ''Harondor''. Anciently its northern border was held to be the river [[Harnen]], but by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] all the land south of the river [[Poros]] was under the influence of the Haradrim.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

After the union and rebuilding of Gondor and [[Arnor]] in the [[Fourth Age]], the new [[Reunited Kingdom]] conquered Harondor and much of Harad's western coast, though Harad's eastern lands remained independent.

== Geography ==
Harad was located south of Mordor, with the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]] forming part of the northern border of Harad. The River Harnen flowed westward from the Mountains of Shadow to the [[Bay of Belfalas]] and was Harad's border with South Gondor - a deserted region contested between [[Gondor]] and Harad. The Harad Road ran from Harad northward through South Gondor and on to [[Ithilien]].

To the north-east of Harad was [[Khand]], a land that also had ties with Sauron. It is not known how far eastward or southward Harad stretched. On the west, Harad was bounded by the Bay of [[Belfalas]] and the [[Belegaer|Sea]].

The northernmost part of Harad was called Near Harad and the southern part was [[Far Harad]]. On the coast there was a natural harbour with a narrow cape curving around it. The coastal region around the harbour was known as Umbar, and the harbour was called the Havens of Umbar. The seafaring raiders known as the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] lived there. At the eastern end of the harbour was the City of the Corsairs.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

Much of Far Harad was a jungle, although there also was a desert. In Far Harad lived the gigantic [[Oliphaunts]], which were used by the Haradrim as moving war towers.

Harad's location in the far south isolated it to a certain extent from the rest of Middle-earth. The climate was much warmer and sunnier (Harad was called the "[[Sunlands]]" by the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]]). There were unusual animals such as the Oliphaunts.<ref name="Gate">{{TT|IV3}}</ref> Even the constellations in Harad's night sky down in the southern hemisphere were different from those in northern Middle-earth ([[Aragorn]] had travelled far into Harad "where the stars are strange"<ref name="Council"/>).

== Social organisation ==
[[Image:Kyle Anderson - Haradrim King.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Kyle Anderson]] - ''Haradrim King'']]
Harad's tribes were divided—at least in the minds of the men of north-western Middle-earth—into those of [[Near Harad|Near]] and [[Far Harad]], although there were many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. The men of [[Near Harad]] were brown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes,<ref name="Gate">{{TT|IV3}}</ref> while the race known as "[[Half-trolls|half-trolls]]" out of [[Far Harad]] had black skin.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> It is also presumed that every tribe had a chieftain, who served as their leader and general in the battlefield.

== Etymology ==
''Harad'' means "South" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref> The word is derived from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHYAR]], and is cognate to [[Quenya]] ''[[hyarmen]]'' ("south").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''KHYAR'''</ref> It is also called [[Haradwaith]] which includes ''[[gwaith]]'' ("people").

The [[Men]] of Harad were called [[Haradrim]] ("Southern-host").<ref name="Council">{{FR|II2}}</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
An early name of Harad was ''(Sun)Harrowland'', which is derived from the [[Old English]] name of the Aethiopans, ''Sigerhearwan'', and therefore meaning "Aethiopia" (See also: ''[[Sigelwara Land]]'').<ref>{{TI|Fangorn}}, Note 4</ref>

==Inspiration==
Given the descriptions of the inhabitants of Middle-earth's southern lands,<ref name="Gate">{{TT|IV3}}</ref> the early etymologies of their name,<ref>{{TI|Fangorn}}, Note 4</ref> and the overall shape of the southern lands as shown in the [[Ambarkanta maps]],<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 250-251</ref> it is likely that Harad may have been based on the lands of [[Wikipedia:North Africa|northern]] and [[Wikipedia:Northeast Africa|northeastern Africa]] and perhaps the [[Wikipedia:Middle East|Middle East]] in our world.
