'''Kilmessë''', [[Quenya]] for "self-name", was a name that some of the exiled [[Elves]] gave to themselves as a disguise, or to refer to deeds or to their personal history.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''Note on Mother-names'', p. 339</ref>

===Other versions of the legendarium===
In an account in "Laws and Customs Among the Eldar" in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', the kilmessë is a name chosen by an Elf-child once she or he is capable of ''lámatyáve'', that is once they gain fluency in their mother-tongue and find pleasure in the sounds and forms of words. It is a private name, used only by family members and close friends, and reflects the child's personality or talents. It is announced in a ceremony called ''Essecilmë'' (name-choosing).<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, p. 216</ref>
