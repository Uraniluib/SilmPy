'''Green Hill Country''' was a patch of country in [[the Shire]], marked out by the [[Green Hills]] that ran west to east through three of the Shire's four [[Farthings]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

The western feet of the Green Hills were in the [[Westfarthing]], in the lands of the [[Took Family|Tooks]]. The Hills cut through the northern corner of the [[Southfarthing]], where the village of [[Pincup]] lay on their southern slopes. Finally, they passed through the border into the [[Eastfarthing]], where they became densely wooded, and reached their eastern end at the appropriately named [[Woody End]].<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

From [[Tuckborough]], a road ran eastwards through the Green Hill Country, and it was this that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] briefly used in their journey from [[Bag End]].
