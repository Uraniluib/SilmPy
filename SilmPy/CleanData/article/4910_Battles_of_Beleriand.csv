There were many battles between the [[Elves]] of [[Beleriand]] and the forces of [[Morgoth]] in the centuries making up the [[First Age]].

These battles are often referred to as the '''Wars of Beleriand''' or '''Battles of Beleriand''', but also as the '''War of the Jewels''' as the [[Silmarilli]] were behind them all but the [[First Battle of Beleriand]].

== Significant Battles ==

The following are the major battles in this long, extended conflict.  Morgoth ever used Angband as a mighty fortress, and the base from which to launch his devastating attacks.  While the Ñoldor had their victories, the [[Doom of Mandos]] always hung over their efforts. Many Men fell in these battles on both sides, and for a long time after the Elves had scorn for the Houses who supported Morgoth.

#The [[First Battle of Beleriand]] was fought before the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] arrived, and was fought by the [[Sindar]] and [[Laiquendi]].
#The Second Battle was the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], or ''Battle-under-Stars'', fought by the Ñoldor following [[Fëanor]] and his [[Sons of Fëanor|Seven Sons]].
#*During this battle the [[Battle of the Lammoth]] was fought by the host of [[Fingolfin]].
#The Third Battle was the [[Dagor Aglareb]], or ''Glorious Battle'', which led to the [[Siege of Angband]].
#*Various minor battles were fought during the Siege which are not counted among the majors.
#The Fourth Battle was the disastrous [[Dagor Bragollach]], or ''Battle of Sudden Flame'', in which [[Ard-galen]] burned and many Ñoldor, including [[Fingolfin]], were slain.
#The Fifth Battle was the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or ''Battle of Unnumbered Tears'', in which the [[Union of Maedhros]] was utterly broken by Morgoth.
#*The [[Fall of the Falas]], in which the havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were sacked and fell, took place after the Nírnaeth.
#*The [[Sack of Nargothrond]], where the city was destroyed by [[Glaurung]] and his [[Orcs]].
#*The [[Fall of Gondolin]], in which Morgoth's hosts besieged and destroyed the Ñoldor and their citadel of [[Gondolin]], killing King [[Turgon]].
#The Sixth and Last Battle of Beleriand was the [[War of Wrath]], which defeated Morgoth, ended the [[First Age]] of [[Arda]] and destroyed Beleriand.
