==Description==

''The Lay of Beowulf'' exists in two different versions â€” the earlier version entitled "Beowulf and Grendel" and the later "Beowulf and the Monsters". These were rendered by Tolkien in typescript, containing a cover page with the handwritten notes "Stages in the accretion of new matter to The Lay of Beowulf" and "Intended to be sung". The date of composition is unknown, but the first verson was sung by Ronald to his son Christopher in the early 1930s.<ref name=Lay>{{Beowulf|Lay}}</ref>

==First stanza of "Beowulf and Grendel"==
<poem><i>
Grendel came forth in the dead of night;
the moon in his eyes shone glassy bright,
as over the moors he strode in might,
   until he came to Heorot.
Dark lay the dale, the windows shone;
by the wall he lurked and listened long,
and he cursed their laughter and cursed their song
   and the twanging harps of Heorot.
</poem></i>
