To celebrate each gathering of fruits, [[Manwë]] made a '''high feast''' in praise of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]. For this feast, the [[Valar]] and [[Maiar]] were bidden to come to the [[Ilmarin|halls of Manwë and Varda]]. Just before the [[Darkening of Valinor]], a feast was held to which also the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] came, and they sang together with the Maiar before Manwë and [[Varda]].<ref>{{S|8}}</ref>
