__NOTOC__
==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|Following the success of the Lord of the Rings 50th Anniversary Calendar, this year’s calendar features paintings by J.R.R. Tolkien himself from the beloved children’s classic, The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The Tolkien calendar for 2006 continues in a popular tradition, building on the success of The Lord of the Rings 50th anniversary calendar, presenting art that has not appeared in calendar form for 30 years.<br/><br/>This year’s calendar features 15 paintings and illustrations by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, which were drawn by Tolkien when writing his beloved children’s classic, The Hobbit. They provide a fascinating insight into how Tolkien imagined the world of Middle-earth would look.<br/><br/>The images are accompanied by informative text which explains how they relate to the story and offers information on their content and history.<br/><br/>Also included, by way of a “poster”, are the two colour maps that the author produced to illustrated Bilbo’s travels: the first of Thror’s Map, showing the location of the Lonely Mountain, the Dwarven treasure and the large dragon that guarded it; and the second of Wilderland, the strange realms that lie over the Misty Mountains into the West.}}
