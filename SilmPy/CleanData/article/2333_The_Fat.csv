'''The Fat''' was an epithet applied to a few character in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works whose defining characteristic was their girth. Perhaps the best known, and indeed the only one mentioned by name in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was [[Forlong the Fat]], the [[Lord of Lossarnach]]<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> who met his fate in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>  In ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', though, Tolkien introduced us to a character who shared Forlong's title - [[Lalia Clayhanger|Lalia the Fat]], the widow of [[Thain]] [[Fortinbras Took II]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{L|214}}</ref>
