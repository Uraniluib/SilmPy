'''Thorin and Company''' refers to the thirteen exiled [[Dwarves]] under the leadership of [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] and the one [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who famously made the [[Quest of Erebor]], travelling through the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]], to recover their ancient treasure from the Kingdom of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], stolen by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]. 

Thorin's company were: 
*[[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]], descendants of [[Náin II]]
*[[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], cousins of Balin and Dwalin
*[[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]], nephews of Thorin
*[[Dori]], [[Nori]], and [[Ori]], Dwarves of the [[House of Durin]]
*[[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur]], descendants of the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves of Moria]]<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> 
*And Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of [[the Shire]]<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>
They were joined by [[Gandalf]] for part of the journey.

Thorin referred to himself and his Dwarven companions as "Thorin and Company" in the opening line of the message left on Bilbo's mantelpiece after the [[An Unexpected Party|unexpected party]] at [[Bag End]].<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

===Portrayal in adaptations===
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]:'''
:The thirteen dwarves all feature in the films, although they do not wear coloured hoods, but are given more developed personalities. Unlike in the book, the Company is pursued by a pack of [[Orcs]] - led by [[Azog]] - throughout their quest. [[Thorin]] is portrayed as younger than in the book (where he was the oldest), and [[Ori]] is also portrayed as being younger than [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]]. When reaching the mountain, the nine Dwarves actually do battle with [[Smaug]] instead of hiding from him in the [[Battle of the Forges]]. The remaining four Dwarves who stayed behind in Lake-town journey to Erebor after Smaug is slain.
