'''''Mio, min Mio''''' ("Mio, my Mio"; published in English as ''Mio, my Son'') is a Swedish language children's book by [[Astrid Lindgren]]. The book has been described as a work in the genre [[wikipedia:High fantasy|High fantasy]].<ref>John-Henri Holmber, "Lindgren, Astrid (Anna Emilia)", in ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'' (New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1997/1999), p.582.</ref>

As both ''Mio, min Mio'' and the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were published in 1954 and can be said to carry some apparent similarities, a Swedish humorous newspaper article concocted a fictitious conspiracy theory that Tolkien and Lindgren must have secretly met some time in the 1930s and agreed upon writing ''"fairy-tales of their own but with a common theme"'' ("var sin saga med gemensamt tema"). The joke aside, the similarities are quite abound:<ref>Petter Karlsson , "[http://www.expressen.se/1.537513 Sagornas likhet är ingen slump]" ("The Similarity of the Fairy-tales is no Coincidence") , in ''Expressen'', January 30, 2007.
