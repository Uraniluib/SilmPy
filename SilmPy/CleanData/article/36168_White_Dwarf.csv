'''''White Dwarf''''' (founded [[1977]]) is a game magazine published by [[Games Workshop]]. 

==History==
Various issues of ''White Dwarf'' have material related to game adaptations of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]: during the 1980s many issues included articles about both role-playing game settings and miniature war games.<ref name=Citadel>[http://realmofzhu.blogspot.com/2010/05/1980s-citadel-lord-of-rings-white-dwarf.html 1980s Citadel Lord of the Rings/White Dwarf Index] at [http://realmofzhu.blogspot.com/ Realm of Zhu] (accessed 18 September 2011)</ref> After releasing ''The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game'' in [[2001]], each issue of ''White Dwarf'' featured a special section about this line of miniature war game (apparently dropping this regular section during the latter half of [[2010]]).<ref name=GW>[http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/armySubUnitCats.jsp?catId=cat1290179&rootCatGameStyle= White Dwarf] at [http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/home.jsp Games-Workshop.com] (accessed 17 September 2011)</ref> Similarly, ''White Dwarf'' has introduced a new regular feature with the introduction of ''[[The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game]]'' in [[2012]].
