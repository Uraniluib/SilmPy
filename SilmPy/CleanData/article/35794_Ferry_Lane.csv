The '''Ferry Lane''' was a short road that led from the [[Causeway]], the high-banked roadway west of the [[Baranduin|Brandywine River]], down to the ferry landing opposite [[Buck Hill]] in [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  The lane was south of the town of [[Stock]] and five or more miles north of [[Farmer Maggot|Farmer Maggot's]] lane.  The entrance to the lane was marked by two tall white posts.<ref name="Short">{{FR|I4}}</ref>  The hundred yards of Ferry Lane were edged with large white-washed stones and ended at a broad wooden landing-stage for the ferry to Buckland.<ref name="Conspiracy">{{FR|I5}}</ref>

It was at the entrance to Ferry Lane that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] caught up with [[Frodo Baggins]] and the other hobbits after their ride from Farmer Maggot's home.<ref name="Short"/>  After crossing the river the hobbits saw a [[Nazg√ªl|Black Rider]] that had followed them down Ferry Lane to the landing.<ref name="Conspiracy"/>
