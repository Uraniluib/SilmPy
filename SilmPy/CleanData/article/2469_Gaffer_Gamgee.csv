'''Hamfast Gamgee''', better known as '''the Gaffer''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], and the father of [[Samwise Gamgee]].
==History==

Hamfast was born in 2926, the third son of [[Hobson|Hobson Gamgee]], who was a roper by trade.<ref name="Gamgee">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

He entered the service of his relative, [[Holman Greenhand]], and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of [[Bag End]]. On [[22 June]], {{TA|2942}}, he and Holman tried frantically to keep the garden in order during the auction of the presumed-dead [[Bilbo Baggins]]. It is likely that at this time he already lived at Number 3, [[Bagshot Row]].

Hamfast became a gardener in his own right in about {{TA|2960}}<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 187</ref>, and a local expert on [[potatoes]]. He married [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]], and they had six children: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], Samwise and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]].<ref name="Gamgee"/> Sam became Hamfast's apprentice.

Sam took over most of his father's work, who had become too old for the laborous work. He became known as the "Gaffer", a name Sam uses more often than "Hamfast".

Prior to the [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]], the Gaffer entertained a crowd at the [[Ivy Bush]]. Always a man of loquacity and knowledge, he argued with [[Sandyman]], [[Old Noakes]] and Ham's neighbor [[Daddy Twofoot]] about the [[Baggins Family|Bagginses]] and the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]].

On [[22 September]], {{TA|3018}}, the night of the departure of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and Sam from the Shire, [[Khamûl]], one of the [[Nazgûl]] rode up the lane, and asked the elderly hobbit about "[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]". A week later, he was visited by [[Gandalf]] who also informed about Frodo's whereabouts.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

When [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and eventually [[Sharkey]] took over the Shire, the Gaffer was evicted from Bagshot Row.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After the [[Battle of Bywater]], in which he only had a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored [[New Row]], while Sam moved into Bag End. He was looked after by the [[Widow Rumble]], and died in [[Fourth Age 7]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

His son, Sam, named his seventh child [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]] after his father.<ref name="Gamgee"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Hamfast'' means "Stay-at-home", or literally, "Home-fast". It is a translation of his [[Westron]] name, [[Ranugad]] [[Galbasi]].<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref> In the [[King's Letter]], the name (referring to [[Hamfast Gardner]], not the Gaffer) is translated into [[Sindarin]] as [[Baravorn]].<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref> 

"[[Wiktionary:gaffer|Gaffer]]" is a colloquial word for "old man".

==In other stories==
In the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', there is a resident in the village named Gaffer Gamgee who struggles to listen to the discussion between Mr Binks and Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] about whether Mr Bliss should be locked up for failure to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named [[Sam]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 63</ref>

==Inspiration==
In [[Letter 257]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930's. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Gamgee. This "curious local character" was "an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer.
 
Tolkien had several encounters with actual Gamgees, however. [[wikipedia:Gamgee Tissue|Gamgee Tissue]], a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after [[wikipedia:Sampson Gamgee|J. Sampson Gamgee]] (1828-1886), a famous [[Birmingham]] surgeon,<ref>{{L|72}}</ref> whilst in the Black Country dialect cotton wool was referred to as "gamgee".<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://sedgleymanor.com/ The Ancient Manor of Sedgley]|articleurl=http://sedgleymanor.com/dictionaries/dialect.html|articlename=Black Country Dialect|accessed=9 September 2014}}</ref> The Gamgees were notorious surgeons - years later, Dr. Leonard Gamgee tended those war-wounded, including Lieutenant Tolkien.{{fact}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[John Church]] plays Gaffer Gamgee. He used a thick peasant accent for the role.  He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Nazgul.  He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Hobbits for wearing "ironmongery."

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Gaffer appears in the film's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], where he is played by [[Norman Forsey]]. The conversation in the Ivy Bush is moved to the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, though the dialogue remains much the same. He does not appear at Sam's marriage in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Dragon, but during the night, he informs Frodo of the Ringwraith that stalks the Shire. He was voiced by an uncredited [[Jim Piddock]].
