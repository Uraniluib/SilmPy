{{disambig-more|Underhill|[[Underhill (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Mr. Underhill''' was the name [[Gandalf]] gave to [[Frodo Baggins]] before he set off on his quest during the [[War of the Ring]]<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>. [[Sauron]] had already learned of ''Baggins'' through [[Gollum]] and using the name outside of [[the Shire]] would prove dangerous, thus a secret identity was formed.

The name was perhaps chosen from the [[Underhill (village)|neighborhood of Underhill]] where [[Bag End]], Frodo's home, belonged.

This was perhaps not the best choice, for when "Mr. Underhill" arrived in Bree, there were several [[Underhill Family|Underhills]] in the common-room at [[the Prancing Pony]] and they thought it likely that Frodo was some long-lost cousin of theirs.  One of the [[Bree-landers]], who seemed familiar with the Shire, asked where the Underhills lived and who were their relations.<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>
