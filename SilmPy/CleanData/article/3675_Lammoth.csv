'''Lammoth''', the "Great Echo", was a shoreland region far to the northwest of [[Beleriand]], north of [[Drengist]] and west of the [[Ered Lómin]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> It was where [[Ungoliant]] set upon [[Morgoth]] to attempt to gain the [[Silmarils]]. As Morgoth was being strangled he cried out in anguish and the echoes of this shout remained in the land thereafter. His cry was heard by the [[Balrogs]] from [[Angband]] who came and rescued their lord from the great spider.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

In the [[First Age]], a battle was fought here between the [[Noldor]] of [[Fingolfin]] and a large host of [[orcs]], resulting in a crushing defeat for Morgoth.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>
