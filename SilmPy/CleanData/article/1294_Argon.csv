'''Argon''' was the fourth and last child and the youngest son of [[Fingolfin]], the first King of the Exiled [[Noldor]] in [[Beleriand]] who was the second son of [[Finwë|Finwë the High-King of the Noldor]].

== History ==
The mother of Argon was [[Anairë]] who was of the Noldor as well, and his elder brothers were [[Fingon]] and [[Turgon]]. Argon and his elder brothers also had only one sister, ''[[Aredhel]]'' (only daughter of Fingolfin and Anairë) who was elder to Argon.

His [[Quenya]] name was ''[[Arakáno]]'' ("High Commander"), named so partially for his impetuous character. Argon set foot on [[Middle-earth]] with his father and brothers, but he was killed during the [[Battle of the Lammoth]].<ref name="Shib">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>  Argon distinguished himself during the fighting by hewing a path through his foes and slaying the captain of the [[Orcs]].<ref name="Note">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, Note 38</ref>

It has been noted that Argon was not mentioned in the published [[Silmarillion]] as being among the sons of King Fingolfin.

== Etymology ==
''Argon'' is the [[Sindarin]] form of '''Arakáno''' although he never used it. It was devised posthumously for him in the records. It is recorded that this later became a popular name of Argon which was used by the [[Eldar]].<ref name="Shib"/>

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
Argon does not appear in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' at all, as he only came to light in very late writings by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].  His character was developed as Tolkien devised the genealogies.  At first he fell in the fighting at [[Alqualondë]] and then he perished while crossing the [[Helkaraxë]] before his death was set in the [[Battle of the Lammoth]].<ref name="Note"/>
