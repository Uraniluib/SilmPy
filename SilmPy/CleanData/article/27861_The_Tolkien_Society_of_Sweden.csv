'''The Tolkien Society of Sweden''' (original name in English) was the first Tolkien Society in Europe, founded in [[1968]] in [[wikipedia:Gothenburg|Gothenburg]]. At first only named "The Tolkien Society", "of Sweden" was added when [[The Tolkien Society]] was founded in the United Kingdom in 1969.

Although The Tolkien Society of Sweden no longer exists as such, several Tolkien Societies exist in Sweden today (see [[Tolkien Societies]]).
