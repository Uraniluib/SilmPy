The '''House of the Heavenly Arch''' was one of the [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim]], led by [[Egalmoth]].  They were a folk of "unaccounted wealth", and were arrayed in many bright colors, for the "heavenly arch" referred to a rainbow.  Their arms were set with jewels that flamed in the light over the sky.  Every shield of that battalion was of the blue of the heavens and its boss a jewel built of seven gems: rubies, amethysts, sapphires, emeralds, chrysoprases, topazes, and amber.  An opal of great size was set in each of their helms.  They were great swordsmen, but also great archers, and with the [[House of the Swallow]] defended the walls of Gondolin during the [[Fall of Gondolin]] in its northern part, pouring clouds of arrows over the hosts of [[Orcs]]. Slowly the battle was lost and they retreated towards the [[Square of the King]], the survivors being gathered together by [[Tuor]] along with those from the [[House of the Swallow]]. Few of the Heavenly Arch escaped the burning Gondolin and most likely dwelt with Egalmoth at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
