'''*nelli''' or  perhaps '''*nelloi''' or '''*neldi''' is a [[Telerin]] word perhaps meaning "singers". 

The word is seen in the ''[[Fallinelli]]'' and ''[[Soloneldi]]'' (which may actually be a Quenya-Telerin hybrid)

The independent word "singer" is probably *''nello''.
==Etymology==
It comes from a possible [[Primitive Elvish]] *''nyeldo'' [[SundocarmÃ«|Root]] [[NYEL]].
