The '''International Tolkien Fellowship''' is a loose group of [[Tolkien Societies]] around the globe which started during the convergence of Societies in [[Oxonmoot]]. The Societies who form the ITF seek to communicate with each other, share their news, announce their activities and maintain the interest of the [[Tolkien fandom]].

Presently it has the form of a facebook group which seeks to provide a comprehensive list of worldwide activities. It published the list of events in [[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]].
