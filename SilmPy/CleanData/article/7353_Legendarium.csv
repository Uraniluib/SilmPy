The '''legendarium''' is the entirety of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works concerning his imagined world of [[Arda]].

Tolkien himself used the term,<ref>{{L|131}}.</ref><ref>{{L|153}}.</ref><ref>{{L|154}}.</ref><ref>{{L|163}}.</ref> and also referred to his "'''mythology'''" in the same sense.<ref>{{L|19}}</ref><ref>{{L|180}}</ref><ref>{{L|229}}</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 135</ref><ref>{{PE|16}}, pp. 88, 92</ref>

The term of legendarium is not the same as "[[canon]]". The legendarium includes all Tolkien's corpus in its entirety, even mutually contradicting versions, both earlier and later stages of its conception.
