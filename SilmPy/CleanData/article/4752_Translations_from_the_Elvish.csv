'''Translations from the Elvish''' was a work, written in three volumes by [[Bilbo Baggins]] between {{TA|3001}} and {{TA|3019|n}}, during his stay in [[Rivendell]]. They formed a substantial part of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], but were omitted from other versions. They were preserved only in the [[Thain's Book]] and its copies.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

Obviously it included such works as the ''[[Ainulindalë (song)|Ainulindalë]]'' and the ''[[Valaquenta]]''.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Translations from the Elvish"</ref>
