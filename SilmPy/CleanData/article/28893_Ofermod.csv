'''Ofermod''' is an essay by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] originally published in [[1953]] along with his alliterative poem "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth|The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]" and another essay titled "The Death of Beorhtnoth". The essay explores the meanings of the [[Old English]] word ''ofermod'', which appears in the original Old English fragment ''[[wikipedia:The Battle of Maldon|The Battle of Maldon]]''. The word is used to describe Beorhtnoth's state of mind at one point in the fragment - Tolkien took the word to mean that Beorhtnoth was a victim of overweening pride (a character flaw that would appear in several of Tolkien's later characters, [[Fëanor]] and [[Túrin]] perhaps being the best examples).
