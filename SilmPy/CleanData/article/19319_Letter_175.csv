==Summary==
Tolkien commented on the first episodes of the [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|radio adaptation]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was airing at the time. Tolkien was less than happy. He called [[Norman Shelley]]'s portrayal of [[Tom Bombadil]] "dreadful", but worse was that [[Goldberry]] was identified as his daughter, and the [[Old Man Willow|Willowman]] as an ally of [[Mordor]].
