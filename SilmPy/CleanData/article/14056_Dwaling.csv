'''Dwaling''' was a village in the far Northern parts of the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]], just north of the hills of [[Scary]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
 
==Etymology==
In a note to translators, Tolkien said that ''Dwaling'' was a regular toponymic formation of a settlement's name, "the descendants of ''Dwale''". ''Dwale'' would be a nick-name of one particular Hobbit, and the name was derived from [[Old English]] ''dwale'', "dull".<ref name="lviii">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], Undated note part of ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]'', cited in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page lviii</ref> This name has been connected to ''[[Dwalak≈çneis]]'', the [[Gothic]] translation of Tolkien's own name.<ref name="lviii"/><ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', pp. 49-52</ref>

Formerly, before the publication of the abovementioned note, [[David Salo]] had suggested it is a form of "dwelling", from Old English ''dwellan'' 'stop, stay, tarry'.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
