The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' were creatures of iron and bronze forged by the smiths of [[Morgoth|Melko]] within the pits of [[Angband]]. They were only ever used against the peoples of [[Gondolin]] during its [[Fall of Gondolin|fall]]. 

==History==
It was [[Maeglin|Meglin]] who first conceived of the creation of monsters of fire and iron, and he brought this idea to Melko during his betrayal.<ref name=Fall>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|169}} When they came against Gondolin, they piled against the northern gate where the [[Orcs]] within would swarm into the breach.<ref name=Fall/>{{rp|176}}

Based on their descriptions, it can be said that the Iron Dragons were inanimate in nature.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}} p. 213</ref> They were made by the most cunning of Melko's smiths and sorcerers. Their iron was expertly linked, so that they could coil and crawl like slow rivers over difficult terrain. Within these devices were Orcs armed with scimitars and spears, ready to emerge at need. It is said that after their appearance at Gondolin, such devices would not be seen again until the [[Dagor Dagorath|Great End]].<ref name=Fall/>{{rp|170}}

==Inspiration==
[[John Garth]] has speculated that the Iron Dragons were perhaps supposed to be partly allegorical of the tanks debuted in the Battle of the Somme.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]''</ref>
