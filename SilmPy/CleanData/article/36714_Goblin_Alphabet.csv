==Description==

[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have noted that the Goblin alphabet is a [[Wikipedia:Pictogram|pictographic]] writing system,<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 298</ref> conveying its meaning through its pictorial similarity to objects. Arden R. Smith has commented that the Goblin alphabet is: 

{{blockquote|quite different from Tolkienâ€™s other invented alphabets. Supposedly based on goblin cave-drawings, it consists mainly of humanoid stick figures. It is essentially alphabetic, but contains a number of characters representing diphthongs and common consonant combinations.|[[Arden R. Smith]]<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Arden R.
