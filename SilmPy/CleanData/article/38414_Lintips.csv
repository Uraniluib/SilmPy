'''Lintips''' were mysterious creatures only mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse. Escaping and laughing at [[Tom Bombadil]], he complains saying they are the "only things that won't talk to me, say what they do or what they be".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Once upon a Time]]", in ''[[The Young Magicians]]'' (ed. [[Lin Carter]])</ref>

==Inspiration==

As in the case of the [[Mewlips]], [[Tolkien fandom|readers]] have "failed to identify a source of the 'lintips'".<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 689</ref> [[Rhona Beare]] has suggested that the lintips are "tiny [[Spirits (creatures)|spirits]]", similar to (or same as) the "gleaming spirits" appearing in Tolkien's poem ''[[An Evening in Tavrobel]]''.<ref>{{ATB|A2}}, p. 284</ref>
