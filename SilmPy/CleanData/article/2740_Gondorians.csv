'''Gondorians''' was a name that referred to the inhabitants of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{L|64}}, also [[Letter 144]], [[Letter 256]]</ref><ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Although the people of Gondor initially were entirely of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent, called the [[Dúnedain of the South]], they came to mingle with many different [[Pre-Númenóreans|peoples]], notably with the influx of [[Northmen]] from [[Rhovanion]].<ref name=south>{{App|A1iv}}</ref>
==History==
The gifts of the Númenóreans were slowly withdrawing since [[Elendil]] came to [[Middle-earth]]. A turning point was the [[Kin-strife]], when many of the great were slain. King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], who himself had [[Northmen|Northmannish]] blood, showed favour to the Northmen who supported him; many noble houses, including the royal [[House of Anárion]] were more mingled with the [[Middle Men|"lesser" Men]].<ref name=south/>

The second evil after the Kin-strife was the [[Great Plague]] that greatly diminished their numbers to the point of withdrawing from the fortresses and the watches over Mordor, and abandoning [[Osgiliath]].<ref name=south/>
==Culture==
The high men of the South married late in their life and had few children. Several of the [[Kings of Gondor]] were childless.<ref name=south/>

Gondorian ships were usually black and silver in colour.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=5 August 2018}}</ref>

Before meal, the Gondorians looked towards the [[West]].<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

==Lifespan==
In the [[Third Age]], the lifespan of the [[Dúnedain]] was less than of their ancestors in [[Númenor]]; specifically after the end of the [[Kings of Gondor]], the waning was even swifter. In contrast, their cousins, the [[Dúnedain of the North]], maintained significant longevity.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Gondorians, or Gondorian Commoners, are one of the cultures, suitable for player characters, that are given a detailed description.
