The '''Bay of Eldanna''' was the wide bay in the western part of [[Númenor]], between the promontories of [[Andustar]] to the north and [[Hyarnustar]] to the south. It was fed by the [[Nunduinë|Nunduinë River]], and its mouth was more than a hundred miles across, making it by far the largest bay in the shores of Númenor.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref>

From Númenor's earliest days, the bay was associated with the [[Eldar]] of [[Tol Eressëa]], who dwelt west of Númenor in the [[Undying Lands]]. The port of [[Eldalondë]] ("Elf Haven") stood at the mouth of Nunduinë River where it emptied into the bay, and the name ''Eldanna'' itself means "Towards the Eldar".<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
