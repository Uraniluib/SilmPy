The '''White Towers''' were three tall towers located in the [[Tower Hills|Emyn Beraid]] west of [[the Shire]]. The westernmost tower, called [[Elostirion]],<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}, note 2</ref> had a ''[[Elostirion-stone|palantír]]'' which looked ever westward towards [[Valinor]].<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}, note 16</ref> From the top of Elostirion it was said that one could view the [[Belegaer|Sea]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

==History==
The White Towers were built on the [[Tower Hills|Emyn Beraid]] by [[Gil-galad]] as a gift to [[Elendil]],<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> perhaps after the founding of [[Arnor]] ({{SA|3320}}<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>).

They were sometimes the destination of pilgrimage by [[Wandering Companies]] of [[Elves]] who would gaze to [[Valinor]] through the ''palantír''. Such a band, led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], met [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in the [[Woody End]] of the Shire on [[24 September]] {{TA|3018}}.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

In [[September]] {{TA|3021|n}}<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> the [[Last Riding of the Keepers|Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings]], including Frodo and Sam, passed the White Towers on their way to the [[Grey Havens]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
