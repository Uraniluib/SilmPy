==Summary==
Tolkien responded to [[Rayner Unwin]] regarding earlier correspondence about the publication of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]'' and related matters. [[Stanley Unwin]] had not liked the title, but Rayner did. Rayner had also asked him for a suitable front cover design, obviously something featuring a tree. Tolkien dismissed Rayner's idea to take one from a medieval manuscript, simply because - as far as he knew - there are no such images. He did have various images of his own, as he regularly drew "mythical" trees when he was pattern-designing. 

Other works - ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' -  were progressing, though with recent events had created some delay.
