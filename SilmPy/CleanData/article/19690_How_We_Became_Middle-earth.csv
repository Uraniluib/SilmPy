== From the publisher ==
{{blockquote|Following the release in [[2001]] of the first film of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|adapted trilogy]] of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'': ''[[the Fellowship of the Ring]]'', a wave of "Ring Fever" swamped the world, with reprints of the novel, guidebooks, [[:Category:Websites|Internet sites]], memorabilia and toys, [[:Category:Games|video and computer games]], location tours and extended DVDs. Taking a Cultural Studies perspective, this collection of essays examines the cultural issues generated by Tolkien's novel and Jackson's films. In particular, by applying a variety of cultural, media and literary theories, the essays in this collection attempt to answer the question: How did we become [[Middle-earth]]? Topics covered range from fan culture in an age of IT, globalization, transnational capitalism and consumerism to the local socio-political implications of the Rings tale, and the formation of a Middle-earth in our real (or, as argued by the French philosopher Jean Beadrillard, our no-longer real but hyperreal) world.This book includes a total of twenty-four chapters, as well as foreword, index, filmography and photo illustrations. It is suitable for broad audience, and can be used for educational and academic purposes.}}
