==Synopsis==

{{blockquote|[[Rayner Unwin]]'s address from 1990 covers the plans for future Tolkien publications. From 1991, [[Tom Shippey]] examines Tolkien's position as a writer amongst his contemporaries. [[Colin Duriez]] in 1992 considered the friendship of Tolkien and C S Lewis. In 1995, [[Joanna Tolkien]], J.R.R. Tolkien's granddaughter related some of her memories of her grandfather. [[René van Rossenberg]], who spoke in 1996 discusses the growth of Tolkien Societies in Europe and how Tolkien is appreciated by those for whom English is not their first language. In 1997, [[Colin Duriez]] returned to discuss how both Tolkien and Lewis placed humanity and creativity at the centre of their work.}}
