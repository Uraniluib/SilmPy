==History==
Within their own household, the Lords of Dor-lómin spoke [[Sindarin]], but at times still used their [[Taliska|native tongue]].<ref name="Coming" /> They were on good terms with the [[Eldar]], and formed marital ties with the houses of [[House of Bëor|Bëor]] and [[House of Haleth|Haleth]].<ref>{{CH|1}}</ref> 

Dor-lómin ceased to exist as a realm of the [[Edain]] following the battle of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], when all of [[Hithlum]] was occupied by [[Easterlings]], in the service of [[Morgoth]], who enslaved the Edain.<ref name="Departure">{{CH|4}}</ref> Húrin was held prisoner in [[Angband]] while his son [[Túrin]] was sent away to [[Doriath]].<ref name="Departure" /> From this point, Dór-lomin was ruled by [[Brodda]] of the Easterlings, until he was killed by Túrin in his own hall. Despite a brief uprising by the Edain, the Easterlings retained control of the land.<ref>{{S|12}}</ref>
