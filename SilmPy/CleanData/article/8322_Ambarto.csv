'''Ambarto''' (pron. {{IPA|[amˈbartɔ]}}) was a [[Quenya]] [[Amilessë|mother-name]] given to [[Amras]], twin son of [[Fëanor]] by [[Nerdanel]], his mother. Initially, both twins were called [[Ambarussa]] so their father insisted on having different names. Nerdanel changed one of the names, without clearly deciding which, to ''[[Umbarto]]'', which meant "the fated". Because of its meaning, Fëanor had quickly urged Nerdanel to change it to ''[[Ambarto]]''. 

It is translated as "Upwards-exalted", being composed from ''[[amba]]'' = "upwards, top" and ''[[arta]]'' = "exalted".<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 353-354</ref>
