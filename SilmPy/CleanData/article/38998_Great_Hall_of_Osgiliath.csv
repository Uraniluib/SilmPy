The '''Great Hall of Osgiliath''' was the joint throne room of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] in the city of [[Osgiliath]]. Although the two brothers kept separate houses in [[Minas Ithil]] (Isildur) and [[Minas Anor]] (Anárion), their thrones were set side by side in the Great Hall.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

Presumably after the deaths of both brothers the early [[Kings of Gondor]] used the Great Hall as their throne room. However, subsequent to the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}} Osgiliath became largely deserted, and in {{TA|1640|n}} King [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] removed the King's House permanently to Minas Anor.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>
