'''Helm's Deep''' is the seventh chapter of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
On the second day of their journey to [[Isengard]], a messenger who told them that [[Saruman]] had almost won met the group. [[Gandalf]] left them with the excuse of having an errand to run. When they reached Helm's Deep, the battle was fierce and the [[Orcs]] seemed to be winning. Suddenly, [[Théoden]] and his men rode up from behind, trapping the Orcs. Gandalf appeared with a contingent of reinforcements, led by [[Erkenbrand]]. The Orcs fled into the nearby forest, but the [[Ents]] captured them and the battle was over as quickly as it had begun.
