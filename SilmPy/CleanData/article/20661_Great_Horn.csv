The '''Great Horn''' was an heirloom of the [[House of Húrin]] until its destruction on [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}.

The horn was made from the wild white [[Kine of Araw]] of [[Rhûn]],<ref>{{App|A1ii}}</ref> which was likened to an ''[[wikipedia:Aurochs|aurochs]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, page 265</ref> It was white itself, tipped with silver and inscribed with ancient characters.<ref name="Window"/> It was said in legend that if the Horn was blown anywhere within the bounds of ancient Gondor, its call would not pass unheeded.<ref name="Window"/>
==History==
The Great Horn was made from the horn of a [[Cows|wild-ox]] of [[Rhûn]]. [[Vorondil the Hunter]], the father of [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], hunted the beasts in the far fields of the East. So, after Mardil Voronwë it passed down to every eldest son.<ref name="MT">{{RK|Minas}}</ref> From [[Denethor]], it passed down to Boromir, who wore it with him on a baldric.<ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Boromir bore the horn with him when he went to [[Rivendell|Imladris]], and held it on his lap during the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref name="Council"/> After he was chosen to be one of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]], he let the horn ring through Rivendell.<ref name="South"/> He would wind the horn twice more. In reply to the meager horns of the [[Orcs]] in [[Moria]], the Great Horn bellowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. Though it repelled the attackers for a while, they returned after the last echo disappeared.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref> 

The last time the horn was rung was shortly before its destruction, on [[26 February|February 26]], on the slopes of [[Amon Hen]], near [[Parth Galen]]. While fighting, Boromir created a sound so loud that it could be heard in [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="MT"/> Sadly, the little help that could come - the rest of the Fellowship - could not make it in time. Though the Uruk-hai were at first dismayed and drew back, they returned more fierce than ever.<ref>{{TT|Uruk-hai}}</ref> In the fight that cost Boromir's life, the horn was cloven in two. 

[[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] laid it in the elven boat with Boromir and his weapons and sent it down the falls of [[Rauros]].<ref name="Departure">{{TT|Departure}}</ref> The two parts of the horn fell out of the boat, and were found several days later. One was found in the reeds near the mouths of [[Entwash]] on [[28 February|February 28]], the other further down the river on [[30 February|February 30]].<ref>{{HM|Scheme}}, page 469</ref> They were brought to Denethor, who held them on his lap, anxiously waiting for news of his beloved son.<ref name="Window"/> Those answers came, eventually, when [[Gandalf]] brought [[Peregrin Took]], witness to Boromir's last stand, before the Steward.<ref name="MT"/>

==Name==
Though generally referred to in fanfiction<ref>"Eambar", "[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4610337/1/The_Horn_of_Gondor The Horn of Gondor]", ''[http://www.fanfiction.net/ FanFiction.net]''</ref> and adaptations<ref name="Breaking"/><ref name="bfme"/> as the '''Horn of Gondor''', this name does not appear in published writing. It is generally referred to simply as "the horn of Boromir"<ref name="Window">{{HM|TT}}, "[[The Window of the West]]"</ref><ref name="Departure"/> as he was its most notorious (and last) bearer. The only capitalized name is "Great Horn", however.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', page 174</ref>

==Inspiration==
One of the many similarities between [[wikipedia:Roland|Roland]], the paladin of Charlemagne, and Boromir is that both bore a white horn.<ref>[[Gerard Seaman]], "Old French Literature", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael Drout]]), page 468-9</ref> Like Roland in battle with the Saracens blew his horn to call for Charlemagne, Boromir called for Aragorn. In both cases, help came too late.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 359</ref>
