'''''The Lord of the Rings: War in the North''''' (commonly abbreviated to '''WITN''') is a role-playing video-game developed by [[wikipedia:Snowblind Studios|Snowblind Studios]] and published by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] for [[wikipedia:PlayStation 3|PlayStation 3]], [[wikipedia:Xbox 360|Xbox 360]] and [[wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. The game takes place during the [[War of the Ring]] but adapts the seldom-mentioned battles that took place across [[Eriador]] and  [[Rhovanion]]. The game was released between [[1 November]] and [[25 November]] [[2011]].<ref name="FAQ Regions Release"/> 

The [[wikipedia:OS X|Mac OS X]] version of the game was developed and published by [[wikipedia:Feral Interactive|Feral Interactive]] and released on [[18 September]] [[2013]].<ref name="Mac version announcement"></ref>  

The game is based on both the books and the films.<ref name="sourceE">[http://www.gamefront.com/ Gamefront], [http://www.gamefront.com/gdc-11-war-in-the-north-hands-on/ GDC 11 – War in the North Hands-on], dated [[10 March]], [[2011]] (accessed at [[6 July]], [[2011]])</ref>

Although the game includes familiar locations from [[Middle-earth]] it does not revolve around the core story of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; instead, it creates an original tale.<ref name="Dev Interview1">[http://www.atomicmpc.com.au Atomic MPC], "[http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/Feature/242441,lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north-dev-interview.aspx/1 Lord of the Rings: War in the North dev interview, page 1]", dated [[22 December|December 22]] [[2010]] (accessed [[5 February|February 5]], [[2011]])</ref> The player controls his own fellowship, a trio of fighters - [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] "[[Ranger of the North]]," [[Andriel]], an [[Elves|elven]] "Loremaster of [[Rivendell]]"<ref group="note">In early development the human was a mage and the Elf a ranger, but this was changed on a later stage.</ref> and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], a [[Dwarves|dwarvern]] "Champion of Erebor" - to get behind enemy lines and have to stop [[Agandaûr]], the game's antagonist, before his plan succeeds.

==Plot==
===Prologue===
The game starts with an introduction, narrated by [[Gandalf]]. Gandalf tells that heroes like [[Aragorn]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and Gandalf are honored much, but that without a few, not well known heroes - [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] - the north of [[Middle-earth]] would have been lost.<ref name="Prologue">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

The game then switches to [[Bree]], where the three heroes make their way to the [[Prancing Pony]], just a few days before Frodo arrived in Bree. Arrived in the Prancing Pony, they find [[Aragorn]] in a corner of the inn. They tell Aragorn that the [[Nazgûl]] attacked and defeated the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] at [[Sarn Ford]], and a flashback shown in which the [[Witch-king]] meets a [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]], [[Agandaûr]]. Eradan, Andriel and Farin overhear their conservation: Agandaûr tells he has summoned an army of [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and assembled an army in [[Fornost]], to aid the [[Nazgûl]] in the [[Hunt of the Ring]]. The Witch-king sends Agandaûr back to Fornost, so he can attack immediately. The flashback ends, and the game returns to the Prancing Pony<ref name="Prologue"/>

Farin asks Aragorn why the [[Nazgûl]] attack [[the Shire]], to which he answers that [[Frodo Baggins|a Hobbit]] with [[The One Ring|an important burden]] is making his way to Bree. And that this "must be protected at all cost". Aragorn sends Eradan, Andriel and Farin to Fornost, where they have to stop [[Agandaûr]]'s army before it can attack.<ref name="Prologue"/>

===Chapter 1: Fornost===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Beleram & Orcs.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Beleram]] - captured by [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] - in [[Fornost]].]]As soon as Eradan, Andriel and Farin enter the ruins of Fornost they are attacked by a band of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]]. After cleaning the main gate, they end up in the pits under Fornost. There they hear an animal screaming. After finding their way out of the pits, they find the source of the noise - a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]]. The three heroes unchain the Eagle and kill it's jailers. The Eagle introduces himself as [[Beleram]], a servant of [[Gwaihir]] who gathered news but was taken out of the air by siege engines and sorcerers. Together the Eagle and the three heroes make a plan: while Beleram would attract the enemy's attention, Eradan, Andriel and Farin would make their way up to the battlements to destroy the siege weapons.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> The plan works out succesful, as all siege weapons as well as two Orc sorcerers are destroyed.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Battlements''</ref> The player, furthermore, obtains a scroll with unreadable text.<ref name="Cult">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Cult of the Lidless Eye''</ref>

When reaching the outer wards of Fornost, the players meets again with Beleram. The eagle thanks his rescuers again and tells    them that he saw [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] within the ruins. While searching the two [[Half-elves]], they defeat a giant crossbow, used by [[Orcs]], and are trapped by a Troll. Just shortly after the death of the Troll, the sons of [[Elrond]] appear.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer Wards''</ref>

[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Eradan, Andriel & Farin2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] and [[Andriel]].]]Andriel introduces Eradan and Farin to Elladan and Elrohir, and informs them about their task. They collaborate in this task, but instead of just stopping the army to attack they decide to kill Agandaûr. The sons of Elrond guide the player to the citadel. They separate, however, after defeating another giant crossbow. Eventually, they are locked on a bridge between two gates. After surviving an ambush, the sons of Elrond appear again and open the gate.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> After defeating another more ambushed, they arrive at the gate of the citadel. Which is protected by a magic spell, to stop intruders. While the sons of Elrond undo the magic, the player defends them against an attacking force of Orcs, Goblins and a Troll. As Eradan, Andriel, Farin, Elrohir and Elladan enter the citadel, Beleram remains outside to protect them against reinforcements.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref>

Inside, they overhear a conservation between Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], chieftain of the [[Orcs]] of [[Mount Gram]]. Tharzog tells Agandaûr that there are intruders in Fornost, after which Agandaûr angrily commands him to find and kill them immediately. After Agandaûr leaves, the player and the sons of Elrond go onward in the tower. Tharzog, however, notices them and as a gate is closed, the player is cut off from the sons of Elrond. Tharzog and his guard attack Eradan, Andriel and Farin, but the latter manage to kill him.<ref name="Citadel Tower">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>

At the same time, Elladan and Elrohir fight Agandaûr on the top of the Citadel tower. Agandaûr is no match for the twins alone, but when Eradan, Andriel and Farin join them he flees on the back of a [[Fell beast]]. Beleram attempt to chase him, but Agandaûr summons a thunderstorm and escapes.<ref name="Citadel Tower"/>

Beleram returns to Gwaihir, in the [[Misty Mountains]], to inform him about the events in Fornost, Elladan and Elrohir return to [[Rivendell]] and Eradan, Andriel and Farin go back to Sarn's Ford to inform Halbarad.<Ref name="Citadel Tower"/>

===Chapter 2: The Barrow Downs===

The leader of the camp, [[Halbarad]], sends the party to [[Rivendell]], to report of the events at Fornost to [[Aragorn]]. As they are to travel through the [[Barrow-downs|Barrow Downs]], Halbarad asks them to keep an eye out for two rangers, Luin and Kilaran, who went missing in the area. Traversing the Barrow Downs, Eradan, Andriel and Farin encounter many wights as they fight their way through the tombs, following ranger clues into Amon Gorthad, the Great Barrow. There, they find Kilaran ensnared in nightmares. Luin has fallen to a great wight, controlling him, and they must defeat him to make their way out and finally head to [[Rivendell]]. <ref name="sourceF">[http://www.oxmonline.com/ Offical Xbox Magazine Online], [http://www.oxmonline.com/article/previews/g-l/lord-rings-war-north The Lord of the Rings: War in the North], dated [[28 April]], [[2011]] (accessed at [[7 July]], [[2011]])</ref> The fellowship travels through the Barrow Downs, where they have to find two lost rangers.<ref name="sourceF"/>

Commentators have noted that this is the first iteration of ''The Lord of the Rings''-based games which is aimed at an older audience - predicted to be the first game in the series to be given an M-rating - with the inclusion of graphic violence and gory bloody detail<ref name="Kotaku Throats">[http://kotaku.com Kotaku], "[http://kotaku.com/5563563/lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-norths-e3-trailer Lord Of The Rings: War In The North Is Cutting Throats, Taking Names], dated [[14 June|June 14]], [[2010]] (accessed [[6 February|February 6]], [[2011]])</ref> with players being able to decapitate orcs and slash limbs off enemies.<ref name="Kotaku Blood">[http://kotaku.com Kotaku], "[http://kotaku.com/5622861/there-will-be-orc-blood-in-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north There Will Be Orc Blood In Lord of the Rings: War in the North]", dated [[27 August|August 27]], [[2010]] (accessed [[6 February|February 6]], [[2011]])</ref> When defeating enemies you can gain experience and loot. With experience you can gain new skills; there are twenty skills for each race.<ref name="sourceE"/> Every skill has five different ranks. Loot can also be found in chests. Some items can only be used by a certain race, therefore it is possible to trade with the other characters of your fellowship.<ref name="sourceH"/> The gameplay - in both single and multiplayer modes - revolves around strategically combining the different abilities of the threesome to good effect, for instance the dwarf can find treasure and spot weaknesses in structures, which lead to alternate roads,<ref name="sourceJ"/> whereas the elf can find herbs to heal other party members. When in single-player, the other two characters will be controlled by computer AI.<ref name="Kotaku Party"/> Working together with the other characters of your fellowship is very important to defeat stronger enemies.

==Development==

Development on War in the North started at early [[2010]] or late [[2009]], [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Saul Zaentz Company]] claimed the name ''The Lord of the Rings: War in the North'' in [[June]] 2009.<ref>[http://www.cinemablend.com/games/ Cinema Blend], [http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Lord-Of-The-Rings-War-In-The-North-Revealed-18358.html Lord Of The Rings: War In The North Revealed], dated [[28 June]], [[2009]] (accessed at [[7 July]], [[2011]])</ref> However, the game was not officially announced until [[18 March]] 2011.<ref>[http://www.cinemablend.com/games/ Cinema Blend], [http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Lord-of-the-Rings-War-in-the-North-Announced-For-PS3-Xbox-360-PC-23485.html Lord of the Rings: War in the North Announced For PS3, Xbox 360 and PC], dated [[18 March]], [[2010]] (accessed at [[7 July]], [[2011]])</ref> Since its announcement several [[:Category:Images from The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|images]], [[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North#Traillers|traillers]] and concept art of several locations and characters has been released.

===Continuity issues===
''War in the North'' is considered to be a tie-in to Peter Jackson's film adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings''. But since this game was developed before the [[The Hobbit (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' entered production, ''War in the North'' features minor continuity errors in relation to those movies.
Elrond will summarize the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] as it is described in the novel; with [[Azog]] perishing during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] at the hands of Dain Ironfoot. However in the movies, Azog survives that battle, but was killed many years later by [[Thorin Oakenshield]] at the Battle of Five Armies.

==Reception==

{{blockquote|It's a very handsome game with well voiced cutscenes, and places the compelling Lord of the Rings realm in the hands of a developer with solid RPG credentials.
