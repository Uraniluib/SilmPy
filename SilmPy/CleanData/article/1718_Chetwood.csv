'''Chetwood''' was the broad woodland that lay to the north and east of the [[Bree-hill]], some forty miles east of [[the Shire]].<ref name="Hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> The village of [[Archet]] was built among the trees near its edge.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>

Prior to the settlement of the Shire many Hobbits lived in Bree and in the Chetwood nearby.<ref name="Hobbits"/>  When [[Aragorn|Strider]] led the four hobbits out of Bree they spent three days in the Chetwood before descending to the [[Midgewater Marshes]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The element ''chet'' (also found in ''[[Archet#Etymology|Archet]]'') , meaning "wood", is said to be of [[Celtic]] origin.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 765</ref> It is seen in the [[Welsh]] word ''[[Wiktionary:coed#Welsh|coed]]''.<ref name=etym>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

It represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Cetwudu'' "wood".

There is a Cheetwood in [[Wikipedia:Lancashire|Lancashire]] and a [[Wikipedia:Chetwode|Chetwode]] in [[Wikipedia:Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], although it is unknown if Tolkien was inspired by these.{{fact}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Chetwood consisted of three areas in the region of [[Bree-land]]. Chetwood South was located around the [[East Road]] south of [[Staddle]], south-east of [[Bree]] and south-west of the [[Midgewater Marshes]]. Chetwood North was north of the marsh, between [[Combe]] and the [[Weather Hills]]. The Far Chetwood lay in the northeast of Bree-land beyond the [[Archet]] Dale, south of the lake of Nen Harn on the border with the [[North Downs]]. Early in the [[War of the Ring]], bandits of the Blackwold gang lived in the woods.
