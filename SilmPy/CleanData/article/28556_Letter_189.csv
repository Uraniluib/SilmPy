==Summary==
Tolkien responded to a reader, Mrs. M. Wilson, who had apparently told him of the interest ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' received from children. Tolkien had noted that, and thought it was a pity, as it was a book written for a more mature audience, and they would have to reread it to fully understand it. Tolkien himself was not very fond of rereading books; the "freshness of the unread" outweighed the possibility of finding a deeper appreciation for him.
