The '''Ranga''', or '''Full Pace''', was a [[Númenor|Númenórean]] linear measure. The ''Ranga'' was said to be a full stride from the rear heel to the front toe, by a full-grown Númenórean man in quick march. It was slightly longer than a yard, measuring 38 inches (3'2", or 96.5 centimetres). 5000 ''Rangar'' made up a ''[[Lár]]''. 

In the later days, when the stature of the [[Númenóreans]] decreased, two ''Rangar'' was called "man-high" (suggesting that the average [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] was 6'4" or thereabouts). One ''Ranga'' was also the average height of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] (hence the name [[halflings|''half''ling]] by the Dúnedain).<ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>
