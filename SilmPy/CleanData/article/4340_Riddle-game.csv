'''Riddle-game''' was an ancient game of the [[Hobbits]], used as a means of settling disputes.<ref group="note">[[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' says that the game was used throughout Middle-earth, although the narrative is not clear on that matter.</ref> The players continued to ask each other riddles until one failed to provide a correct answer.

==History==
The origins of the game are not known, save that it was very ancient and its rules were agreed by the [[Authorities]] and respected as sacred.<ref group="note">Foster interprets this by saying that the rules "were held among the guardianship of the [[Valar]]"</ref>

{{Blockquote|What has roots as nobody sees,<br/>Is taller than trees,<br/>Up, up it goes,<br/>And yet never grows?<ref group="note">"Mountain" is the answer.</ref>|[[Gollum]]<ref name="HRiddles"/>}}

The most famous riddle-game was the one in which [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Gollum]] competed. If Gollum failed to answer a riddle, he would show Bilbo out of the [[Misty Mountains]]. However, if Bilbo lost, Gollum would eat him. The two exchanged several riddles, and Gollum's knowledge of the answers suggested to [[Gandalf]] years later that he had possibly been a hobbit once. At last, strapped for riddles to ask the loathsome creature, Bilbo, touching [[The One Ring|the ring]] he had found in the tunnels, asked "What have I got in my pocket?". Gollum failed to answer correctly, despite being given three guesses. Reneging on his promise, Gollum plotted to use his "Precious" to murder and eat Bilbo, but when he found it missing, he too late guessed the right answer to Bilbo's "riddle".<ref name="HRiddles">{{H|Riddles}}</ref>

==Other riddles==

Riddles also appear in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. [[Théoden]] described a [[Ere iron was found or tree was hewn|poem recited by Gandalf]] as a riddle,<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref> and Gollum yet again provides [[The cold hard lands|a riddle]].<ref>{{TT|IV2}}</ref><ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]], "[http://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&pg=PA527&lpg=PA527&dq=Ere+iron+was+found+or+tree+was+hewn&source=bl&ots=hiJzeIbaXi&sig=g0Et2UDoSyXUNrSHIMVyaIPQCfA&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsqK_f5N3QAhXCDCwKHa-TBowQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&q=Ere%20iron%20was%20found%20or%20tree%20was%20hewn&f=false Poems by Tolkien: ''The Lord of the Rings'']", in [[Michael D.C. Drout]] (ed), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref>

==Inspiration==

In a letter, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] made the following comment concerning the riddles appearing in ''[[The Hobbit]]'': "There is work to be done here on the sources and analogues".<ref>{{L|25}}, p. 32</ref> [[Douglas A. Anderson]] has claimed to having identified possible inspirations behind eight out of nine riddles;<ref>{{HM|AH}}</ref> [[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]] has noted a resemblance between the remaining riddle ("Voiceless it cries") with a riddle published by [[Wikipedia:Cecilia Böhl de Faber|Cecilia Böhl de Faber]]. While admitting that the similarity between the two riddles is "surely a mere coincidence", Ferrández Bru also speculates that Tolkien may possibly have read or heard the poem in his youth through Father [[Francis Xavier Morgan]], Böhl de Faber's great-niece.<ref>[[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]], "'Wingless fluttering': Some Personal Connections in Tolkien's Formative Years", in {{TS|8}}, p. 54</ref>
