'''Tark''' is an [[Orkish]] word that was often used by the [[Orcs]] of the later [[Third Age]] to describe a [[Men|Man]] of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] heritage (such as the [[Gondorians]]). Considering the enmity between the Orcs and the Men of [[Gondor]], the word ''tark'' tended to be used in an insulting way.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref><ref name=PE17/>

==Etymology==

There exists at least two, only slightly different, etymological explanations of ''tark'':

#a corrupted version of ''[[tarkil]]'', a [[Westron]] borrowing from [[Quenya]] that literally meant "[[High Man]]".<ref>{{App|F1}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 603</ref>
#unknown etymology, but "possibly a mere abbreviation of ''[[tarkil]]''".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 101</ref>
