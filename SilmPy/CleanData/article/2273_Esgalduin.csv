'''Esgalduin''' was a major tributary of the [[Sirion]], which rose in the dark heights of the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] from the [[Shadowy Spring]], and flowed southwestward to meet the Sirion on the western borders of [[Doriath]]. It marked the boundary between the forests of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]] and [[Forest of Region|Region]].
==Etymology==

In a manuscript dating from the late 1950s and early 1960s, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote that  ''Esgalduin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "the river under shade".<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 15, 184</ref>

In the earlier ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', the name ''Esgalduin'' was said to be [[Ilkorin]] for "River under Veil (of [?leaves])",  consisting of the elements ''[[esgal]]'' ("screen, hiding, roof of leaves") +  ''[[duin]]'' ("water, river").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 355 (DUI-), 357, (EZGE-), 386 (SKAL<sup>1</sup>-)</ref>
