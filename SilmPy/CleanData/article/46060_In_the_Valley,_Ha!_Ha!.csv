'''In the Valley, Ha! Ha!''' is the second track on ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]'', with its reprise being the twelfth track. They were respectively adapted from the poems "[[O! What are you doing?]]" and "[[The dragon is withered]]" from ''[[The Hobbit]]''. While sung by [[Glenn Yarbrough]] on the soundtrack, the version that appears in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]] is sung by the cast members. The reprise, however, is sung by the cast members in both the film ''and'' on the soundtrack.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Oh, what are you doing,
And where are you going?
Your ponies need shoeing,
The river is flowing!
Oh, tra-la-la-lally
Here down in the valley, ha! ha!

Oh, where are you going
With beards all a-wagging?
No knowing, no knowing,
What brings Mr. Baggins,
And Balin and Dwalin
In June? in the valley, ha! ha!

Oh, will you be staying,
Or will you be flying?
Your ponies are straying!
The daylight is dying!

To fly would be folly,
To stay would be jolly.
Tra-lil-lil-lil-lolly, ha! ha!

Oh, what are you doing,
And where are you going?
Your ponies need shoeing,
The river is flowing!
Oh, tra-la-la-lally
Here down in the valley, ha! ha!

'''REPRISE:'''

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The dragon is withered,
His bones are now crumbled.
His armour is shrivered,
His splendour is humbled!
Oh, tra-la-la-lally
Here down in the valley, ha! ha!

Though sword shall be rusted,
And throne and crown perish
With strength that Men trusted,
And wealth that they cherish,
Oh, tra-la-la-lally
Here down in the valley, ha! ha!

The stars are far brighter
Than gems without measure,
The moon is far whiter
Than silver in treasure

The leaves are yet swinging,
And Elves are yet singing,
Come back to the valley, ha! ha!

Oh, where are you going,
So late in returning?
The river is flowing,
The stars are all burning!
Oh, tra-la-la-lally
Here down in the valley, ha! ha!
</poem>
