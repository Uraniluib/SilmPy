==History==
Holman of [[Hobbiton]] had five children; [[Rowan]], [[Halfred Greenhand|Halfred]], [[Erling]], [[Hending]] and [[Rose (daughter of Holman)|Rose]]. He passed his skills and crafts on to his eldest son, Halfred, who formed the surname [[Greenhand Family|Greenhand]] out of his father's nickname.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
