The '''Ironfists''' were one of the seven houses of the [[Dwarves]] that dwelt in mountains of the East of [[Middle-earth]]. They were originally paired with the [[Stiffbeards]].<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref>

The locations of the four [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] clans, including the Ironfists, who lived in the [[East]] are unknown. The distance between their mansions in the East and the [[Misty Mountains]], specifically [[Gundabad]], was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance from the [[Blue Mountains]] in the West.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref>

It is possible that the Ironfists were among the "''Houses of other Fathers''" who sent troops to help [[Durin's Folk]] in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]].<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>

Late in the [[Third Age]], when war and terror grew in the [[East]] itself, considerable numbers of Ironfists and dwarves of the Eastern clans left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: The unnamed Dwarven tribes were given invented names in an early supplement.<ref>{{ICE|8004}}</ref> While these were published before the publication of Tolkien's late note on the name of the Dwarven houses of the East, it has been suggested that the Ironfists could correspond to '''Thel√≥r's tribe''' (as portrayed in ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]]'').<ref>[[Thomas Morwinsky]], "A Brief History of the Dwarven Mansions", in ''[[Other Minds]]'' issue 4 (July 2008)</ref>

'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''
: The House corresponding to the Ironfists is called '''Sindri's Folk''', said to inhabit a mountain chain of central Middle-earth.<ref>{{D|M}}</ref>
