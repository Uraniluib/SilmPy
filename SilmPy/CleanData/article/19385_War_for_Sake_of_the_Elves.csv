The '''War for Sake of the Elves''' was fought by the [[Valar]], under orders from [[Manwë]], the [[Elder King]], against [[Morgoth|Melkor]] to liberate the newly-awakened [[Elves]] from his influence.  It culminated in the near-apocalyptic [[Siege of Utumno]], where Melkor was captured, enchained, and imprisoned for three ages of the world.

== Prelude ==

After the Fall of the [[Two Lamps]], the Valar held council among themselves and  spoke of the message they had received from Eru Ilúvatar of his coming children, the [[Elves]]. [[Yavanna]] noted that the time of their arrival was unknown and they should not leave the lands of their future dwelling unprotected. [[Tulkas]] likewise agreed with the necessity of immediate action.<ref name="Captivity">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

Manwë bid Mandos to speak, and he replied that the Children shall come in this age, and the [[Firstborn]] will walk under the stars. [[Varda]] then created other stars to help to light Middle Earth for the coming of the Elves.  Using silver dews from [[Telperion]], she created many new stars, including [[Wilwarin]], [[Telemendil]], and others. As a challenge to Melkor, high in the north, she hung the seven stars that make up the [[Sickle of the Valar]].  After Varda's long effort, the Elves, the Firstborn Children of Ilúvatar awoke in the starlight by the shores of [[Cuiviénen]], the Water of Awakening.<ref name="Captivity"/>

While [[Oromë]] conducted his hunting trips on his great steed [[Nahar]], he heard the newly-born Elves singing.  He met them and spent time among them, and yet perceived the influence of Melkor among them, as they were afraid of him.  Oromë reported these findings to the [[Elder King]], who once again called a gathering of all the Valar, even the far-off [[Ulmo]].  He then proclaimed that they "should take up again the mastery of Arda at whatever cost, and deliver the Quendi from the shadow of Melkor".

== The War Begins: The [[Battle of the Powers]] ==

The titanic conflict between the Valar and Melkor now began in earnest,  with the [[Host of the West]] (Valar) confronting the [[Host of the North]] (Melkor).  Melkor would ever remember that this war was begun for the Elves' sake, and it would be burned in his memory.  The hosts first clashed in the North-west of Middle Earth, and that region was battered and broken by this collision.  The Valar quickly prevailed, driving Melkor off.  

The Elves heard little of the details of the battle.  They could feel the earth creaking and groaning under them, and saw bright lights in the North, like those of great fires.<ref name="Captivity"/>

== The [[Siege of Utumno]]==

Melkor retreated to his great underground fortress of [[Utumno]].  There the Valar besieged him for years, and fought many battles before its gates.  It was during this time that the contour of Middle Earth was changed, with the Great Sea being widened.  The [[Bay of Balar]] was carved out, and the great river [[Sirion]] came into being.  The northern highlands of [[Hithlum]] and [[Dorthonion]], sources of Sirion, were raised up as new mountain ranges.  The far north was laid waste, as the Valar's power descended into the deep pits of Utumno. In the end, the pits and halls were unroofed, and [[Tulkas]] wrestled Melkor and cast him down, and bound him with the powerful chain [[Angainor]].

== Aftermath ==

The [[Valar]], while very powerful, were not omniscient.  They failed to find some of the deepest chambers under Utumno and [[Angband]], and Morgoth's lieutenant [[Sauron]] was never captured.  Some [[Balrogs]] and other evil creatures hid there, and others dispersed to the far edges of the earth, the Valar's strength too depleted from the lengthy siege to pursue and destroy them.  The Valar dragged Melkor back to Valinor for judgment before [[Manwë]], in the [[Máhanaxar|Ring of Doom]].

In the Ring of Doom, Melkor laid upon his face and begged for mercy from Manwë, but his prayers were denied.  He was cast into the prison of Mandos for three ages, after which he would be brought before [[Manwë]] once more.  The Valar gathered in council once again, and it was decided, after some debate, to summon the [[Quendi]] (Elves) to Valinor to preserve them from evil influence.  Oromë chose ambassadors to accompany him back to Valinor, where they beheld the glory of the Two Trees.  Then the [[Great Journey]] began.<ref name="Captivity"/>
