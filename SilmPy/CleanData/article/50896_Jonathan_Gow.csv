'''Jonathan Gow''' was a professor in [[Oxford]]. After [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy]] had become a lecturer, he gave a series of lectures with the title of ''Public-house School'' (as he himself dubbed it), about an Oxford-based literary discussion group.<ref name="Gow">{{SD|2c}}, "Night 61"</ref>

But professor Gow had puffed and boggled at the title. Therefore Jeremy had offered to change it to ''Lewis and Carolus, or the Oxford Looking-glass'', or ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' but that did not smooth matters.<ref name="Gow"/>
