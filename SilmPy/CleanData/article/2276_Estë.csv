'''Estë''' was a one of the [[Valier]] and the wife of [[Irmo]]. 

==Attributes==
Estë had the power to heal all hurts and weariness.<ref name=vala/> Her favourite place was an island on the tree-shadowed lake of [[Lórellin]] in the [[Gardens of Lórien]] where she slept during the day. She was always clad in grey.<ref name=vala/>

==History==
Estë dwelt with her husband Irmo in the misty halls and extensive, silver-lit gardens of [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. There were many [[Maiar]] who served Estë and Irmo. In Lórien, Estë and her husband tended to the [[Elves of Valinor]], who drew refreshment from the fountains, and even the [[Valar]] would come there to find repose and ease from the burdens of [[Arda]].<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> 

[[Varda]] originally intended to place the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] in the sky, one travelling from the east and one from the west, to allow for a mingling of their lights. However, Estë and her husband spoke against this as the excessive heat and light had withered their gardens, the stars were hidden, and restful sleep had been banished from the Earth. Varda listened to their counsel and, to allow for a time of night, changed the course of the Moon and the Sun. Each would then take turns travelling through the sky as the other lay in [[Ekkaia]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier drafts of this character, Estë did not attend the Councils of the Valar and was not reckoned among the Valier. Instead. she was counted as a Chief of the Maiar.<ref>{{MR|P2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''Estë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈeste]}}) means "rest".<ref>{{HM|S}}, "Index"</ref> The same [[Sundocarmë|Root]], ''[[EZDE]]'', also yielded her [[Sindarin]] name, '''Îdh''' (pron. {{IPA|[iːð]}})<ref>{{HM|LR}}, "[[The Etymologies]]", entry EZDE</ref> and the [[Nandorin]] '''Eord'''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]], [[Patrick H. Wynne]] (eds.), "Addenda and Corrigenda to the ''Etymologies''", published in ''[[Vinyar Tengwar 45]]'' ([[November]] [[2003]]), pages 3-38, especially 13</ref>

She was also referred to as Estë 'the Pale' several times in the [[Annals of Aman]].<ref>{{MR|Index}}</ref>{{rp|446}}
