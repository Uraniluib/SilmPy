'''Goblin-men''' were a people or race of creatures that were bred by [[Saruman]]. They were similar with the [[Half-orcs]], at least in their resistance to the sunlight, an attribute that differentiated them from the full [[Orcs]]. They fought alongside Half-orcs, [[Hill-men]] and [[Dunlendings]] in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=tt7/>
