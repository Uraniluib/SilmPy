The '''Goblin Scribe''' is miniature [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblin]] played by [[Kiran Shah]] (via motion-capture) who worked as a scribe and a messenger for the [[Great Goblin|Goblin King]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''. He records events in [[Goblin-town]]. He is a tiny goblin with malformed legs, and uses his long fingernail to write with on parchment. Because he cannot walk, he gets around on a pulley with a seat attached to it.

The Goblin King gives him orders to send a message to [[Azog]] that they have captured [[Thorin]].

==Behind the scenes==
According to members of the film crew, the Goblin Scribe is the offspring of the [[Great Goblin|Goblin King]], but he isn't given any proper recognition because of his diminutive stature.{{fact}}
