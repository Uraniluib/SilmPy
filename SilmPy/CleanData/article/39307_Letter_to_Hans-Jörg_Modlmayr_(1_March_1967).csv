==Excerpt==

In the circumstances I felt it necessary to send your letter to the Foreign Rights Department of [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]], who deal with all matters of translation for me. I should, of course, be particularly pleased to have a German translation, and I believe that discussions are proceeding between Allen & Unwin and German publishers. I have the translation of ''The Hobbit'' (Paulus Verlag) ..."
