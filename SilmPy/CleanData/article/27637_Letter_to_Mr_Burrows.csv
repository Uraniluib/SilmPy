{{blockquote|Dear Mr Burrows,<br/><br/>Thank you for kind & appreciative letter. I return your 'Hobbit' cover signed.<br/><br/>You have not discovered my address: I left Oxford a year ago. I now live in 'retirement' &mdash;in an endeavour to preserve some time free from interruptions. All letters will be forwarded from the <s>above</s> below address. I have been unwell during July and this added to the forwarding by the P.Office must be my excuse for delay. Best wishes. Yours sincerely<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}
