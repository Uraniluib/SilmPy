'''Edith Mary Tolkien (née Bratt)''' ([[21 January|January 21]], [[1889]] – [[29 November|November 29]], [[1971]]) was the daughter of Frances Bratt and Alfred Frederick Warrilow. She would become [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s wife. 

When Tolkien was living at 37 Duchess Road, Edgbaston, Edith was a young female lodger who lived in the bedroom beneath Tolkien and his brother Hilary.

They were married on Wednesday, [[22 March]], [[1916]] in Warwickshire, England. She was the mother of his four children: [[John Tolkien|John]], [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]], [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], and [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]].

J.R.R. Tolkien sometimes referred to Edith as the [[Lúthien]] to his [[Beren]], and these names are inscribed on the grave they share.
