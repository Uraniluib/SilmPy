'''''Tales Before Tolkien''''' is a collection of fantasy fiction which inspired [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Editor [[Douglas A. Anderson]] has noted that the title ''Tales before Tolkien'' was suggested by the publisher; his original title had been ''Roots of the Mountain: Fantasy before Tolkien''.<ref>[[Douglas A. Anderson]], "The Mainstreaming of Fantasy and the legacy of ''The Lord of the Rings''", in ''[[The Lord of the Rings 1954-2004]]'', p. 314 (note 31)</ref>

==From the publisher==

"For those interested in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s sources comes Tales Before Tolkien: The Roots of Modern Fantasy, edited by [[Douglas A. Anderson]] ([[The Annotated Hobbit]]), which collects 22 classic stories by such masters as [[George MacDonald]], Andrew Lang, Lord Dunsany and [[James Branch Cabell]]. Arthur Machen aficionados will especially appreciate "The Coming of the Terror" (an abridgement of his short novel The Terror), hitherto unreprinted since its initial magazine appearance in 1917.
