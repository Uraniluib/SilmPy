==From the publisher==
[[File:LSG_manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|Excerpt from the original manuscript]]
The world first publication of a previously unknown work by J.R.R. Tolkien, which tells the epic story of the Norse hero, Sigurd, the dragon-slayer, the revenge of his wife, Gudrun, and the Fall of the Nibelungs. 

Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien composed his own version, now published for the first time, of the great legend of Northern antiquity, in two closely related poems to which he gave the titles ''The New Lay of the Volsungs'' and ''The New Lay of Gudrun''. 

In the ''Lay of the Volsungs'' is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fafnir most celebrated of dragons, whose treasure he took for his own; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild who slept surrounded by a wall of fire; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In that court there sprang great love but also great hate, brought about by the power of the enchantress, mother of the Niflungs, skilled in the arts of magic, of shape-changing and potions of forgetfulness. In scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, and Gudrun his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands of his blood-brothers, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrun. <br>
In the ''Lay of Gudrun'' her fate after the death of Sigurd is told, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers, and her hideous revenge. 

Deriving his version primarily from his close study of the ancient poetry of Norway and Iceland known as the Poetic Edda (and from the later prose work the Volsunga Saga), Tolkien employed a verse-form whose lines embody in English the exacting alliterative rhythms and the concentrated energy of the poems of the Edda.

==Relation to the Legendarium==
While ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'' is naturally not directly connected to the stories of [[Arda]] and [[Middle-earth]], Christopher Tolkien notes a few related concepts which occur in the work:

*''[[Wargs]]'' (p. 373, note 37)
*''[[Ents]]'' (p. 376, note 17)

A few other concepts also found in this work, from which Tolkien likely derived material for his [[legendarium]], are worthy of note:

* ''[[Mirkwood]]'' (pp. 131, 227-8, 372)
* ''[[Moriquendi|Dark Elves]]'', ''[[Light-elves|Light Elves]]'', ''[[Dwarves]]'' (pp. 358-60)
