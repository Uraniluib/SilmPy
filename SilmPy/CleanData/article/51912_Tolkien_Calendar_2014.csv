==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|With over 40 new pieces of artwork based on The Hobbit, The Tolkien Calendar 2014 features 12 never-before-seen full colour illustrations, and 28 sketches by artist Jemima Catlin.<br/><br/>Each month depicts The Hobbitâ€™s most famous scenes, including Bert, William and Tom being turned to stone, the Elves singing in the trees, Bilbo riding a barrel, and Smaug attacking Lake-town.<br/><br/>The Official Tolkien Calendar has been an established publishing event for Tolkien fans and collectors for the last four decades. Tying in with a brand new illustrated edition of The Hobbit, the 2014 edition is a truly charming addition to the series by a gifted artist whose paintings lend themselves perfectly to the calendar format.}}
