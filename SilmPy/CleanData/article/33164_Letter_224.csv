==Summary==
Tolkien had read [[C.S. Lewis]]'s latest, ''[[Wikipedia:Studies in Words|Studies in Words]]'', and remarked that Lewis's ponderous silliness had become a fixed manner.  Fortunately, said Tolkien, he had not been mentioned.  He had written a long analysis of *BHŪ, of which Lewis had only used the first nine lines and dismissed the rest with "we have not a shred of evidence".

The best part, thought Tolkien, was the wise remark on the last page: "…the very occasions on which we should most like to write a slashing review are precisely those on which we had much better hold our tongues."  Tolkien commented ''Ergo silebo''.<ref group="note">"Therefore I will keep silent" in Latin.</ref>
