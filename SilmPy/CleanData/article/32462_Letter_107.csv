==Summary==
Tolkien reported receiving letters from [[Horus Engels]] about a German translation of ''The Hobbit'', although he seemed he was not proposing himself as the translator.  Illustrations from Engels had certain merits but were too "Disnified" for Tolkien's taste: [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] with a dribbling nose and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun instead of Tolkien's Odinic wanderer.

Tolkien informed Unwin that soon he was moving and hoped this would solve domestic problems that stole so much time.  He still hoped to finish ''The Lord of the Rings'' before January, stating that he was on the last chapters.
