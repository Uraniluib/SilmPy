'''Old English''' (also called '''Anglo-Saxon''', though [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] apparently avoided the term<ref>[[T.A. Shippey]] (2000), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century]]'', p. xii</ref>) was the ancestor language of modern English. It was also the mother language of characters [[Ælfwine]] and [[Eriol]].

Anglo-Saxon was typically written in a [[Runes|runic script]] before the introduction of the Latin alphabet.

==History==
{{quote|I have to teach or talk about Old English to such a lot of young persons who simply are not equipped by talent or character to grasp it or profit by it.|J.R.R. Tolkien<ref>{{L|90}}</ref>}}
Tolkien was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College from [[1925]] to [[1945]]. He favored especially the Mercian dialect and was strongly influenced by Old English literature such as ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''. 

In earlier notes concerning the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', Tolkien commented that Old English was the only language the Elves of [[Eressëa]] could talk to Men, and that was how they talked to Ælfwine. The Elves learned Old English while living with Men in [[Luthany]].

Tolkien wrote in Old English several texts of his legendarium, which he (fictionally) attributed to Ælfwine such as the ''[[Earliest Annals of Valinor]]''; they were published more recently in ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'' and are commented and edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. These texts have been criticized because Christopher Tolkien did not provide a translation and they remain understandable only by Anglo-Saxon students. 

In those works, Eriol gave several Old English names to several elements of the legendarium; in some of them, Tolkien attempted to imitate the Elvish sound and form, but with a new meaning. For example [[Angband]] is rendered as ''Engbend'' "cruel-bond", [[Balrog]] as ''Bealuwearg'' "baleful-monster" or [[Silmaril]] as ''Sigelmaerels'' (actually referring to the [[Nauglamír]]). At least one name, ''[[Mickleburg]]'', survived in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.

Anglo-Saxon runes were used on the [[Thrór's Map]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' to display the [[Cirth]] as used by the [[Dwarves]].

Tolkien devised a [[Tengwar]] mode for Old English, for texts written by [[Edwin Lowdham]] in ''[[The Strange Case of Arundel Lowdham]]'' ([http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 DTS50] and [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS51 DTS51]).

==Rohirric==
For ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien used several Anglo-Saxon names and words, which represented [[Rohirric]], the language of the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> This simulated the archaic sense the [[Hobbits]] felt with the Rohirrim; Hobbits spoke [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]], represented in the book by English.

However the relation of Old English and English is not the same as with Rohirric and Westron, since the latter descends from [[Adûnaic]], not Rohirric.
