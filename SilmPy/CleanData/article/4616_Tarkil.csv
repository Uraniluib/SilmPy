'''''tarkil''''' is a [[Quenya]] word, used in the [[Westron|Common Tongue]] as a name for a [[Men|Man]] of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent.<ref name=App>{{App|F1}}</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 603</ref><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 101</ref>

The [[Orcs]] corrupted the word, and used ''[[tark]]'' as an insulting term for a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]].<ref name=App/><ref name=RC/>

It has been suggested that ''tarkil'' also probably lies behind the meaning of the name of [[Tarcil]], the sixth [[King of Arnor]].<ref name=Arda>[http://www.encyclopedia-of-arda.com/t/tarkil.html Tarkil] at [http://www.encyclopedia-of-arda.com/ The Encyclopedia of Arda] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref> 

==Etymology==

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], ''tark'' derives from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''tāra-khil'' ([[Sundocarme|roots]] [[TUR]] and [[KHIL]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 364, 395</ref><ref group="note">''tarkil'' as related to the root [[KHIL]] also appears in a later manuscript, cf. {{PE|17}}, p. 101.</ref> It has been suggested that ''tarkil'' means "literally 'high follower' ([since] the [[Elves]] referred to Men as ''[[Men|followers]]'' because they were the [[Afterborn]] [[Children of Ilúvatar]])".<ref name=Arda/><ref group="note">Cf. [[TUR]] for the connection to "high" and [[KHIL]] for the connection to "follower".</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the word appears only in a footnote (added in the [[George Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] second edition, 1966) in [[Appendix F]]. However, at one time it was destined for more prominence: in the early drafts of the work, [[Aragorn]] himself is known as "the Tarkil", but this was changed to "the Dúnadan" in the published text.<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 603</ref><ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 8</ref>
