{{main|Undeeps}}
The '''South Undeep''' was one of two westward bends of the river [[Anduin]] located between [[The Wold]] and the [[Brown Lands]] (the other being the [[North Undeep]]).  The South Undeep was the smaller of the two bends.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  Both of the Undeeps had many shallows and wide shoals that afforded an easy crossing for armies,<ref>{{UT|6c}}</ref> which occurred a number of times during the history of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]].
