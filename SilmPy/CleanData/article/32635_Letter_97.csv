==Summary==
Tolkien reports wasting time writing a letter to the ''[[The Catholic Herald (23 February 1945)|Catholic Herald]]'' (published as "[[The Name Coventry]]"). A sentimentalist correspondent had written about the etymology of ''[[Wiktionary:Coventry|Coventry]]''; if someone said it did not come from ''[[Wiktionary:Convent|Convent]]'' then that was not "in keeping with Catholic tradition". Tolkien calls the writer a boob. ''Convent'' had entered English after 1200 A.D. and had meant "assembly"; the meaning of "nunnery" was not recorded before 1795. Being annoyed, Tolkien asked if he wanted to change the name of Oxford to Doncaster, but thought him too stupid to see the mild quip.
