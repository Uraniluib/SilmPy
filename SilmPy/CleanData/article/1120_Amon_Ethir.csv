'''Amon Ethir''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. ''[[Amon]]'' "hill" + ''[[ethir]]'' "spy") was raised artificially by the people of [[Finrod]] in the wide plain of [[Talath Dirnen]], a league east of the Doors of [[Nargothrond]] above the river [[Narog]]. Over the years, trees grew on its flanks, but from its clear summit the watchers of Nargothrond could watch the lands about with the clear sight of the [[Elves]], and so the hill got its name, Amon Ethir.<ref>{{CH|14}}, p. 205</ref>

After the [[Sack of Nargothrond]], the hill still stood, and it was here that [[Nienor]] encountered [[Glaurung]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]]. Having plunged the land into a thick fog of dragon-reek, so that only the hill remained above the mists, he cast Nienor into a deep spell of forgetfulness.  After the departure of the dragon, [[Mablung]] found Nienor in a daze upon the hill and led her away.<ref>{{CH|14}}, pp. 208-210</ref>
