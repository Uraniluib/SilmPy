His solutions were small map changes, an extra day for the [[Entmoot]], and extra days for [[Trotter]]'s<ref group="notes">"Trotter" was an early name for Aragorn, later changed to "Strider".</ref> chase and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s journey (two days from the [[Morannon]] to [[Ithilien]]). Unfortunately he had to stop and deliver lectures.
