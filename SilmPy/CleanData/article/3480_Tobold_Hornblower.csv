'''Tobold "Old Toby" Hornblower''' was a famous [[Hobbits|Hobbit]].

==History==
Toby came from [[Longbottom]] in the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]]. He was the first to cultivate [[pipe-weed]] in the Shire ({{SR|1070}}), and was quite famous for it. How he came by the weed is unknown, for to his dying day he would not tell, though [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] speculated that he had traveled to [[Bree]] in his youth and came into contact with the herbs there.<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}, "Concerning Pipe-weed"</ref><ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref><ref>{{App|B2}}</ref>

His name, "[[Old Toby]]", was given to his variety of weed.

==Etymology==
Tobold is a form of ''[[Wikipedia:Theudebald|Theobald]]'' which contains ''theud'' "people" and ''bald'' "bold".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 31</ref>

In a draft version of the chapter "[[The Road to Isengard]]", the name of this hobbit was Elias Tobiasson of Mugworth.<ref>{{WR|1|III}}, p. 36</ref> In Swedish, ''Elias Tobiasson'' is a normal [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_name#Scandinavia name of a person].<ref>Noted by [[User:Morgan]] (26 December 2010)</ref>
