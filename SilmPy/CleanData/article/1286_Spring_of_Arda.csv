The '''Spring of Arda''' was a period of peace and flourishing that started when the [[First War]] between the [[Valar]] ended.  
==History==
When the Enemy fled and [[Arda]] was completed, in the [[Valian Year 1900|1,900th year]] the Valar raised [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]]. Arda became filled with trees and herbs, beast and birds, and all the lands were green.  In the midmost of Arda was the Isle of [[Almaren]] in the [[Great Lake]] where, due to the blending of the light of the [[Two Lamps]] all things were richest in grown and fairest in hue, and there the Valar made their abode and rested.<ref>{{MR|P2a}}, p. 52</ref> Yet beyond the [[Walls of Night]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] lurked.

[[Manwë]] ordained a great feast in the [[Valian Year 3400|3,400th year]] at which [[Tulkas]] wed [[Nessa]].  

After the feast Tulkas slept and Melkor, seeing his chance, passed into the North of [[Middle-earth]], raised the [[Iron Mountains]] and began the delving of his vast fortress [[Utumno]] from which things were perverted and blighted.

In the [[Valian Year 3450|3,450th year]] Melkor came forth in war and threw down the [[Two Lamps|Lamps of the Valar]], breaking the lands, roiling the seas, and ending the Spring of Arda.<ref>{{MR|P2a}}, p. 53</ref> In their efforts to stay the raging storm and preserve what they may of their creations, the Valar were unable to chase and defeat Melkor, who retreated to [[Utumno]]. 

The Spring of Arda was marred as living things became sick, or rotted, or corrupted into monstrous forms. The destruction of the Lamps brought relative darkness to [[Middle-earth]] for several centuries, a period known as the [[Sleep of Yavanna]]. After witnessing the destruction that their powers might cause, the Valar were ever after cautious, fearing for the safety of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], who hadn't yet entered Arda.<ref>{{S|III}}</ref>
