An '''éoherë''' was the name used by the [[Men]] of the [[Éothéod]] for a full muster of their armed riders. When [[Eorl]] rode from the north to the aid of [[Gondor]], he led an éoherë of some seven thousand horsemen, as well as several hundred mounted archers.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> The successors of the Éothéod were the [[Rohirrim]], and they continued to use this term. In [[Théoden]]'s day, some five centuries after the [[Ride of Eorl]], the full éoherë of [[Rohan]] was reckoned as one hundred [[éored]]s, or a total of twelve thousand fighting men.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 36</ref>
==Etymology==
The word ''éoherë'' is [[Old English]] (''[[wiktionary:eoh#Old_English|eoh]]'' + ''[[wiktionary:here#Old_English|here]]''), and means (approximately) 'horse-host'. Translated into [[Gondor Sindarin]], this became the name [[Rohirrim]], the much more common term for the Men of Rohan.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 49</ref>
