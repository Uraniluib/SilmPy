''Middle-earth: Dark Minions'' (MEDM), released in [[1996]], was the second expansion set for ''[[Middle-earth: The Wizards]]'', the first basic set of [[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game|MECCG]].

The set also adds an underground network of site cards, ''The Under-Deeps'', which later becomes The Balrog's realm (for [[MEBA]]).

*'''Number of individual cards:''' 180

MEDM was sold in booster packs of 15 cards (36 boosters per display), featuring 1 rare, 4 uncommons and 10 commons per booster pack.
