'''''Tolkien's Poetry''''' is a collection of ten essays examining [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s poetry. It was published as No. 28 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|J.R.R. Tolkien is best known for his prose work, especially his novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Although there are many poems included in his novels that add depth to the narrative, Tolkien's talent as a writer of poetry has scarcely been appreciated and in-depth studies of Tolkien's verses are rare. This collection edited by Julian Eilmann and Allan Turner presents ten papers and an introduction by Michael Drout that deal with specific aspects of Tolkien's poetry. Some papers focus on one particular poem, while others examine a group of poems with a specific thematic approach. Among other topics, this collection highlights Tolkien's development as a writer of alliterative verse, the relationship between poetry and faith, or the function of poems in the narrative of The Lord of the Rings. In addition this volume takes a critical look at the use of poetry in Peter Jackson's movie trilogy, illustrating how Tolkien's verses contribute to a contemporary adaptation of this literary classic. }}
