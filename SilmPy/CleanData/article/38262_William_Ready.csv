Ready foresaw the cultural value of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings and, while at [[Marquette University]], he managed to purchase a large selection of original literary manuscripts by Tolkien in 1956-57, including manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>[[Douglas A. Anderson]], "The Mainstreaming of Fantasy and the Legacy of ''The Lord of the Rings''", in ''[[The Lord of the Rings 1954-2004]]'', p. 313 (note 29)</ref><ref name=CG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 513-3</ref>

According to his own account, Ready had arranged a lecture tour for Tolkien at American universities, but Tolkien was forced to decline because of illness. In order to make amends, Tolkien therefore offered Ready to buy his manuscripts.<ref name=Montreal/> However, [[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have stated (deriving from archived correspondence) that Tolkien "''was directly approached to sell his papers, and did not himself suggest their sale.''"<ref name=CG/>
