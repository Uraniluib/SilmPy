'''Onya''' is a [[Quenya]] word with two possible meanings: 

# a term of address simply meaning 'my son'. Its only recorded use is between [[Meneldur]] and his son [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]], but there is reason to believe that it was more widely used, at least among noble [[Men]]. Its opposite was [[Atarinya]], "my father", and we know that this was used by the [[Exiles of NÃºmenor]] long after Meneldur's time, so it's reasonable to assume that the word onya survived in use at least into the [[Third Age]], too.

# a word for [[Ent]].
