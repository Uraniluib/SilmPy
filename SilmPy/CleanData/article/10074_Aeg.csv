'''''aeg''''' is a noun meaning "point" in [[Sindarin]]. Compare ''[[ecthel]]'', "spear point".

Examples:
* [[Egalmoth|Aegamloth]] = "A Spike upon a Flowered Crest"
* ''[[aeglos (spear)|aeglos]]'' = "icicle"

== Conflicting Definition ==
Earlier in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] development of [[Sindarin]], ''aeg'' meant "fell" or "dire" and was the equivalent of the [[Quenya]] ''[[aica]]''. Tolkien later rejected this definition, deciding that ''aeg'' only translated as "point". This complicated the translations of some names, as Tolkien never developed another Sindarin equivalent for ''[[aica]]''.

Example:
* [[Aegnor]] = "Fell Fire"
