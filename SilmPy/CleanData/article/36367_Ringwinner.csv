'''Ringwinner''' was one of several names and titles used by [[Bilbo Baggins]] during his encounter with the dragon [[Smaug]]. Bilbo made these titles intentionally obscure and mysterious: 'Ringwinner' referred to the [[The One Ring|Magic Ring]] Bilbo wore, and his "winning" of it after the [[riddle-game]] with [[Gollum]].<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>
