'''Emeldir the Manhearted''' (born {{FA|406}}) was a woman of the [[House of Bëor]] in [[Dorthonion]], the wife of [[Barahir]] and the mother of [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], ''Beren the One-handed''. Like her husband, Emeldir was also of the House of Bëor through the line of [[Belen]] who was the youngest son of [[Bëor]] himself.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref>  

After the [[Dagor Bragollach]], when Dorthonion was ruined and infested, Emeldir's husband Barahir and her only child and son Beren became outlaws fighting the evil creatures. Emeldir would have preferred to stay with her family to fight, but as the women and children of the [[First House of the Edain]] had to flee from their homes, Emeldir finally led them, and after many hardships they reached [[Brethil]]. It was because of this bravery, she was known as ''Emeldir the Man-hearted''.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
Emeldir named her son after her father himself, [[Beren (son of Belemir)]].

==Etymology==
[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that ''Emeldir'' possibly consists of [[Sindarin]] ''emel'' ("mother") + ''dir'' ("man"), yielding a hypothetical translation "manly-mother" or "mother with manly courage" (close in meaning to her epithet the Manhearted).<ref>{{VT|48a}}, pp. 17-8 (note 14)</ref>
