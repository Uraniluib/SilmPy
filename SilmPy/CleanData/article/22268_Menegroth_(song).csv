==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
A king there was in days of the old 
Ere men yet walked upon the mould 
His power was reared in caverns shade 
His hand was over glen and glade 

His shields were shining as the moon 
His lances keen of steel were hewn 
Of silver grey his crown was wrought 
The starlight in his banners caught 

And silver thrilled his trumpets long 
Beneath the stars in challenge strong 
Enchantment did his realm enfold 
Where might and glory wealth untold 


</poem>
Sample spoken by Feanor: 
''"I say that we will go on, and this doom I add.."''
