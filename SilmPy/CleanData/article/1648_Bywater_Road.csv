'''Bywater Road''' is a road in [[the Shire]], branching from the [[East Road]] and leading to [[Little Delving]].
==Course==
A little to the west of the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], a branch of the East Road sloped upward between high banks<ref name=rk/> leading to the village of [[Bywater]] from which the Road took its name. From there, it carried on to [[Hobbiton]], where a traveller would turn right and cross a bridge across [[the Water]] for about thirty miles, to reach [[Hobbiton Hill]] and [[Bag End]]. The road itself continued into the west, in the direction of [[Little Delving]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>
==History==
On [[3 November]] {{SR|1419}},<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] used this feature to trap the band of [[Ruffians]] who came to crush the rebellion of the [[Hobbits]] against [[Sharkey]]'s rule.  Wagons were used to close the trap on either end, which gave the Hobbits the edge in the resulting [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref name=rk>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
