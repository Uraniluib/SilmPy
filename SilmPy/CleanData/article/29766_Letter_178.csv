==Summary==
Tolkien described his inspiration for [[the Shire]]; that of a Warwickshire village around the time of the [[wikipedia:Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]] (1897). Many reviewers had likened it to North Oxford - mainly based on Tolkien's professorship - but Tolkien found that region depressing and characterless.
