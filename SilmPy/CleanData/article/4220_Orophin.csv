__NOTOC__
'''Orophin''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]] of [[Lothlórien]].

==History==
Orophin was the brother of [[Haldir]] and [[Rúmil (elf of Lórien)|Rúmil]]. He was one of the [[Galadhrim]] who seldom left Lothlórien and spoke but a little of [[Westron]].

He was one of three wardens of the northern border of Lothlórien met by the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] as they entered the [[Lothlórien|Golden Wood]]<ref name=ii6>{{FR|II6}}</ref> on [[15 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

Some days later, when a band of a hundred [[Orcs]] were seen passing the [[Nimrodel]], the three brothers went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood. Orophin ran back to warn the Galadhrim and prepare an ambush and fortify the wood.<ref name=ii6/>

==Etymology==
[[Robert Foster]] identified the name as either [[Sindarin]] or [[Silvan]].<Ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 109</ref> At another point it is described to be "''suitable to [[Sindarin]] sounds and patterns''" although it is "''not clearly etymologizable as Sindarin''".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 51</ref>

One possibility is that ''Orophin'' means "Mountain Peak", from ''[[orod]]'' and ''[[pind]]''.<ref>[[Didier Willis]], [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/24600 Elfling Message 24600]</ref>
