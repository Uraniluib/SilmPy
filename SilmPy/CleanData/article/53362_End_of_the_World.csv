'''''End of the World''''' is the title of an illustration by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref name=AI>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 40, 65</ref>
==Description==
''End of the World'' shows an apparently carefree man stepping out from a cliff into an abyss. Beyond the cliff are the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and [[stars]] — elements which are pivotal in Tolkien's [[legendarium]]. The illustration was made in December [[1912]], and was collected by Tolkien with other illustrations from the same period in an envelope labelled "[[The Book of Ishness|Earliest Ishnesses]]".<ref name=AI/>
==Inspiration==
While explicitly claiming no direct link between the two illustrations, [[Dimitra Fimi]] has noted the resemblance of Tolkien's ''End of the World'' to [[Wikipedia:The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]] from the [[Wikipedia:Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite tarot deck]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Dimitra Fimi]]|articleurl=http://dimitrafimi.com/paul-mccartneys-the-fool-on-the-hill-tolkiens-early-drawings-and-the-rider-waite-tarot/|articlename=Paul McCartney’s “The Fool on the Hill”, Tolkien’s early drawings, and the Rider-Waite Tarot|dated=29 August 2016|website=[http://dimitrafimi.com dimitrafimi.com]|accessed=24 November 2016}}</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have noted that Tolkien's technique in this illustrations has produced a "restless sky drawn as if by [[Wikipedia:Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]".<ref name=AI/>
