__NOTOC__
'''''elen''''' (pl. '''eleni''' or '''eldi''') means "star" in [[Quenya]].<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''elen''</ref>

The [[Edain]], however, equated ''elen'' and ''[[elda]]'' ("[[Elves|Elf]]"), so in some situations ''elen'' translates as "Elf".

==Etymology==
[[PQ]] [[Sundocarmë|Root]] [[EL]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''EL'''</ref>

==Inspiration==
''El'' means "deity" in some Semitic languages, and is a common element in many Hebrew names, as happens with [[Elvish]] names. Dante Alighieri in his ''De vulgari eloquentia'' suggests that the word ''El'' was the first sound emitted by Adam: While the first utterance of humans after birth is a cry of pain, Dante assumed that Adam could only have made an exclamation of joy, which at the same time was addressing his Creator.{{fact}}<!-- How do we know Tolkien was inspired by this, or which scholar has suggested it, even if it's an interesting theory?
