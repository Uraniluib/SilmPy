'''Seek for the Sword that was broken''' is a rhyme that appeared in dreams to [[Faramir]] and later his brother [[Boromir]]. 

==Rhyme==
{{quote|In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:
<poem>
 Seek for [[Narsil|the Sword that was broken]]:
 In [[Rivendell|Imladris]] it dwells;
 There shall be counsels taken
 Stronger than Morgul-spells.
 There shall be shown a token
 That Doom is near at hand,
 For [[Isildur's Bane]] shall waken,
 And the [[Hobbits|Halfling]] forth shall stand.</poem>|Boromir, ''[[The Council of Elrond]]''}}

==History==
When Faramir had the dream, he did not speak of it. He had the dream twice again, and his brother had it once. Neither knew what exactly the "Doom" and "Isildur's Bane" referred to, nor where "Imladris" was. Their [[Denethor|father]] told Boromir that Imladris was where Lord [[Elrond]] dwelt, and the road being too dangerous, Boromir took it upon himself to follow this lead.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:The song is sung by [[Matthew Vine]] in a high-pitched voice at the Council of Elrond. It is the reason for Boromir's coming to Rivendell, and is explained by [[Aragorn]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Elrond]].
