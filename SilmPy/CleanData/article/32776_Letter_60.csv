==Summary==
Christopher had arrived in his training camp in South Africa and letters were beginning to flow again between him and his father.  Tolkien missed his son but reported that things had begun to be easier for him.  He had helped admit more cadets but that task was done.  He had seen [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams]] for two hours.  He read his recent chapter from ''The Lord of the Rings'' to approbation and had started another.

Since the letter did not get sent Tolkien added more on April 15th.  At a meeting at Magdalen with Lewis, Williams, Warren H. Lewis,<ref group="note">C.S. Lewisâ€™s brother</ref> and the Useless Quack,<ref group="note">[[Robert Havard]]</ref> they had heard W.H. Lewis read from his projected book on Louis XIV.  The subject did not interest Tolkien but it was wittily written.  He also thought little of the conclusion of C.S. Lewis's latest allegory.

Tolkien had managed to get [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] nearly to the gates of [[Mordor]].  He told of other incidents in his life and said he would continue the "Ring" in every salvable moment.
