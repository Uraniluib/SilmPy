'''Thomas Kenneth "Tea Cake" Barnsley''' ([[1891]] - [[1 August|August 1]], [[1917]]) was a friend of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] at [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]]. Barnsley was in the Debating Society with Tolkien and he also performed in The Rivals. He was also a member of the [[T.C.B.S.]], though not within the inner circle of friends. While reading History at [[Cambridge]] he decided to join the 1st Birmingham Battalion, and serve in the [[World War I|war]]. After rising to the rank of Captain, in August [[1916]] he was buried alive by a trench mortar, though he managed to escape and return to England. After being sent to Belgium in July of 1917 he was killed in action near Ypres while consoling a captured prisoner. Barnsley would be one of many of Tolkien's friends that died in the war.
