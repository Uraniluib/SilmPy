The '''Green Hills''' was a range of hills that ran west-to-east through [[the Shire]], through three of the Shire's four [[Farthings]], and gave its name to the region known as the [[Green Hill Country]]. To the west, in the [[Tookland]], the hills were fairly open and treeless. In contrast, their eastern slopes towards [[Woody End]] were densely wooded with trees of all kinds.<ref name=map/> The hills were burrowed with [[hobbit-hole]]s and [[smials]], like the [[Great Smials]].<ref name=rk/>

At least three rivers and streams had their sources among the [[Green Hills]]; the River [[Shirebourn]], the [[Thistle Brook]] and the [[Stock-brook]]. One of the chief towns of the [[Shire-hobbits]], [[Tuckborough]], lay among the western hills, and other villages were to be found among their slopes, or about their feet, including [[Tookbank]], [[Woodhall]] and [[Pincup]].<ref name=map>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

On [[23 September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] passed through the Green Hills on the start of their journey.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Later, in {{TA|3019|n}}, when the [[Ruffians]] were lodged in the Shire they found the deep holes of the [[Took Family|Tooks]] in the Green Hills defeated their attempts to control that part of the Hobbits homeland.<ref name=rk>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
