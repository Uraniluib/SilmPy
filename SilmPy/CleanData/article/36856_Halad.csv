'''Halad''' or "Warden" was the title of the [[Chieftain of the Haladin]] who was the leader of the [[Folk of Haleth]] in the Forest of [[Brethil]]. The Halad's residence was called [[Obel Halad]].<ref name="Title">{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 263</ref>  His duties included command of the armed men of the land<ref name="Title"/> and leadership of the [[Folkmoot]], the gatherings of the people called to make important decisions.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 283</ref>

The position of the Halad was elective, chosen by the people of Brethil, but by custom all chieftains had come from the noble [[House of Haleth]].<ref name="Title"/>  After [[Brandir|Brandir the Lame]] had died in {{FA|499}}<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(iii) The Haladin'', p. 237</ref> there was some contention in Brethil concerning who should become the next Halad.  Many had wished to elect [[Manthor]] but Hardang came from the senior branch of the family under [[Halmir]] and obtained the title.<ref name="Office">{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 270</ref>

==Etymology==
Since the chieftains of Brethil were elected from the family of [[Haldad]] it was natural to used the term "Halad" for the position.  Haldad's name meant "watchdog" and was derived from ''hal(a)'', meaning "watch" or "guard".<ref name="Office"/>

When spoken of in a general way this official was called "The Halad";<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 275</ref> when name and title were spoken the title came second, as in "[[Hardang]] Halad".<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 276</ref>  

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
All of the information about the office of the Halad comes from ''[[The Wanderings of HÃºrin]]'' in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]''.  This was a late-written story that [[Christopher Tolkien]] regretfully chose not to use in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

In a section not included in the story it was stated that [[Avranc]], not of the House of Haleth, was chosen for the next Halad but that the authority and reverence of the office was gone.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 54, p. 308</ref>

In an isolated note [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had written possible name changes.  One would have substituted ''Halbar'' for ''Halad''.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 55, p. 309</ref>
