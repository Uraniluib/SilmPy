For three ages after the departure of the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]] and [[Teleri]] to [[Aman]], the [[Elves]] who inhabited [[Beleriand]] comprised that part of the [[Telerin]] people who remained in [[Middle-earth]], known as the [[Sindar]] or "Grey-elves" after their king, [[Thingol]] Greycloak of [[Doriath]].

At the rising of the Moon in the beginning of the [[First Age]], many of the Noldor returned to Beleriand from Aman to make war on [[Morgoth]]. While there was some enmity between the Sindar and the Noldor (especially the Sons of [[FÃ«anor]]), the two peoples lived together in the face of their common foe, [[Morgoth Bauglir]].

Finally, a small part of the [[Nandor]], kin of the Sindar who had turned aside from the westward journey east of the [[Misty Mountains]], entered the land of [[Ossiriand]] during the First Age. Though these people, called the [[Laiquendi]] ("Green-elves"), played little part in the wars against Morgoth, they are accounted a part of the Elves of Beleriand.
