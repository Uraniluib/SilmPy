==Etymology==
''Hareth'' also appears in ''[[Haudh-en-Arwen#Names|Tûr Haretha]]'', the "Ladybarrow", so the name probably means "Lady" in the Haladin tongue.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] also suggests that ''Hareth'' means "Lady",<ref name=guide/> however the entry erroneously labels the name as [[Quenya]].

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Halmir's second daughter, Hiril, was a later addition to the House of Haleth family tree.  Before she was introduced Hareth's name was "''Hiriel''".<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, footnote, p. 269</ref>
