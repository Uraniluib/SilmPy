'''Seregon''' was a plant that grew in rocky soil and produced blood-red flowers, which gave it its name. ''Seregon'' was noted as the one plant that mantled the otherwise barren head of [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref name="Mim">{{CH|7}}</ref>

In the [[First Age]], [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] was the captain of the [[Gaurwaith]], an outlaw band, that was seeking a new lair when they captured [[Mîm]] the [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarf]].  In return for his life Mîm led the [[Men]] to his home, which was carved into the summit of [[Amon Rûdh]].  As they approached the secret hideout from the north, sunlight from the west illuminated the hill and its rich, red flowers, causing the outlaw [[Andróg]] to exclaim, "See! There is blood on the hill-top".<ref name="Mim"/>

Mîm later betrayed Túrin and his followers to a party of [[Orcs]].  The Orcs attacked the hideout and killed all but Túrin and his elf-friend [[Beleg]].  The blood of the rest of the outlaws flowed out upon the ''seregon''.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
