The '''Mindeb''' was a river of [[Beleriand]], a northern tributary to the river [[Sirion]].

The Mindeb began in the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] near the [[Anach|Pass of Anach]], and was met by a tributary coming from the [[Crissaegrim]]. Upon its western bank was the land of [[Dimbar]] while on the east were the valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]] and the [[Forest of Neldoreth]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  In its lower reaches it bordered [[Doriath]] and thus was part of the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>
