'''The History of Galadriel and Celeborn''' is a chapter belonging to the book [[Unfinished Tales]], which was written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Synopsis==
Christopher Tolkien says that this chapter of the book is not actually a history, but a bulk of concepts explored by Tolkien concerning the Elven realms of the [[Second Age]] and the place of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] among them.

Celeborn's past is explored, who could be both [[Teleri|Teler]] of Valinor or a [[Sindar|Sinda]] as well. There are also references to [[Amroth]], the King of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] before the arrival of Galadriel and Celeborn, other legends connected to him such as [[Nimrodel]] and [[Mithrellas]], and a discussion about the [[Silvan Elves]] and their speech.

There is also a discussion on [[Celebrimbor]], where the idea that he was in love with Galadriel is introduced, a fact connected to the [[Elessar of Eärendil|Elessar]]; there is also a reference to [[Enerdhil]] the obscure smith of [[Gondolin]] who in a version of the story created the Elessar.

All in all, the chapter discusses and presents several versions of the aforementioned tales and essays related to them; along with their contradictions, which Tolkien may have abandoned or never resolved, failing in the end to determine final, definitive versions thereof.
