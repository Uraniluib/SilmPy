'''John Garth''' (b. [[9 June]] [[1966]]), winner of the 2004 [[Mythopoeic Society]] Scholarship Award, studied English at [[Oxford University]] and has since worked as a newspaper journalist in London. A long-standing taste for the works of Tolkien, combined with an interest in the First World War, fueled the five years of research that have gone into ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'' and he has drawn extensively on previously unpublished personal papers as well as Tolkien's service record and other unique military documents. Since 2005, he is a member of the Review Panel of ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]''.<ref>{{VT|47}}, p. 2</ref>
