'''''In the Nameless Wood: Explorations in the Philological Hinterland of Tolkien's Literary Creations''''' is a collection of essays examining [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works with respect to other literature. It was published as No. 30 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Following in the footsteps of the previous publication, [[Tolkien's View|Tolkien's View: Windows into his World]], Professor J.S. Ryan in this latest collection of essays pursues Professor Tolkien's narrow path through the Nameless Wood of uncharted territory between academic research and mythcreation culminating in the writing of the 20th century's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Having himself studied under Professor J.R.R. Tolkien and having written for no less than 50 years on his inspirational teacher, his sources and the applicability of his writings, J.S. Ryan is uniquely placed to reflect not only on Tolkien the Scholar or Tolkien the Author, but equally on Tolkien the Man.}}
