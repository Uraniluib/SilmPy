'''''The Silmarillion [by] J.R.R. Tolkien: A Brief Account of the Book and its Making''''' is a pamphlet published by [[Christopher Tolkien]] soon after the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The text was reprinted in ''[[Mallorn]]'' [[Mallorn 14|14]] (1980, pp. 3-5, 7-8).

==Excerpt==

"[F]or a time,I worked toward a book that would show something of this diversity, this unfinished and many-branched growth. But it became clear to me that the result would be so complex as to require much study for its comprehension; and I feared to crush ''The Silmarillion'' beneath the weight of its own history. I set myself, therefore, to work out a single text, by selection and arrangement." (p.4)
