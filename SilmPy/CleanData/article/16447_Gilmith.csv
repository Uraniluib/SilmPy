'''Gilmith''' was the daughter of [[Imrazôr]], a man of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent, and [[Mithrellas]], a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] [[Elves|Elf]]-maiden who accompanied [[Nimrodel]] before getting lost. Imrazôr took her in, they married and had two children, Gilmith and [[Galador]]. Mithrellas later ran away and was never seen again.  Galador would later become the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 220-2</ref>
