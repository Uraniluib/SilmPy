==Summary==
Tolkien sent [[Wikipedia:Hugh Brogan|Hugh Brogan]] Christmas greetings in a note with three inscriptions.  The first was a form of [[Angerthas]] not quite matching the dwarf-runes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  The second was in [[Tengwar|Fëanorian script]] with ''[[tehtar]]'' (marks above consonants) while the third was in Fëanorian script with full letters for the vowels.<ref group="note">[[Christopher Tolkien]], in the "Notes" section of ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', Letter 118, provided a transcription for these inscriptions.</ref>
