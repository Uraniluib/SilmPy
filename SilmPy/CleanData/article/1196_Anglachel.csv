'''Anglachel''' was the sword forged by [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] from a meteorite. Its mate was [[Anguirel]]. The blade was black but also glowed and was so hard that it could easily slice through iron. It was said that it was imbued with Eöl's malice and was apparently sentient.
==History==
Eöl gave Anglachel to his lord, King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], as payment for letting him dwell in the [[Nan Elmoth|Forest of Nan Elmoth]]. Thingol would not bear it, as [[Melian]] warned him that there was malice in the blade, so it stayed in the armoury of [[Menegroth]].

In {{FA|487}} Thingol allowed [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] to take any weapon in his search of his friend [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], and he took Anglachel. He tracked down the [[Orcs]] taking Túrin captive to [[Angband]] and in the dead of night, sought to free him in secret. But when he used Anglachel to cut the bonds of Túrin, due to the spite of its forger it slipped and pricked the unconscious body of Túrin. Awakening from his stupor, Túrin thought the Orcs had returned to torture him, and during the struggle he slew Beleg with the blade. After the fight, Anglachel's edges became dull and turned a dead black and for that time ceased to glow with a 'pale fire'. This was attributed to its apparent sentience as Anglachel was in a state of mourning over the slaying of Beleg.

Túrin later reforged the sword with the help of the smiths of [[Nargothrond]]. The blade remained black, however, and Túrin renamed it '''[[Gurthang]]''', meaning 'iron of death'. Anglachel was the sword that Túrin used to kill [[Glaurung]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that ''Anglachel'' contains the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[ang]]'' ("iron") and probably the element ''[[lhach]]'' ("leaping flame").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''ang'' and ''lhach''</ref> This would give the meaning "Flaming Iron". The last element in ''Anglachel'' could be ''êl'' ("star").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 20 July 2011)</ref>
