'''''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''''' is a 14th century manuscript. In [[1925]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[E.V. Gordon]] published a scholarly edition of it. It was not a translation, though Tolkien did make [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (translation)|one]]: it was published later along with his translations of ''Pearl'' and ''Sir Orfeo''. 

==Back Cover (2nd edition)==
The study of ''Sir Gawain'', the finest of all the English medieval romances, was signally advanced by the publication in 1925 of the edition by the late Professors Tolkien and Gordon. This remained the most widely used text of the poem; but after forty years the time came for revision. The new edition pursues the aim of the first â€“ to present an accurate text pleasantly, with sufficient apparatus to enable a reader to understand the rich but difficult language, and so to reach for himself an informed appreciation of the poem. The Text, and the iniquely full glossary, were revised to take account of recent views. The Introduction, Notes, and Linguistic Appendix were largely rewritten; and the book was entirely reset.
