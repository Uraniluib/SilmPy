'''Vidugavia''' was a prince of the [[Northmen]], self-styled "[[King of Rhovanion]]" who ruled the lands between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]].<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
He was the ally of [[Gondor]]'s King [[Rómendacil II]], and helped him to his victory against the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|1248}}.  He also received Rómendacil's son [[Valacar]] into his court as ambassador in {{TA|1250|n}}. Valacar would eventually wed Vidugavia's own daughter, [[Vidumavi]].<ref name="gondor"/>

Vidugavia was apparently the father of other children, since he was also an ancestor of [[Marhari]].<ref name="Children">{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 5</ref>
