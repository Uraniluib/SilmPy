The [[Treachery of Men]] refers to the betrayal by the [[Easterlings#Sons_of_Ulfang_.22the_Accursed.22|House of Ulfang]] at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. However the House of Ulfang was already in the service of [[Morgoth]] for many years prior, masquerading as being loyal to the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. When Morgoth learnt of the battle-plan of the [[Union of Maedhros]] for the Nirnaeth, he ordered those traitors to delay the advance of the Eastern Host lead by [[Maedhros]] as they pushed west as part of the plan to flank Morgoth's armies. The mass defection fatally slowed Maedhros' host, stopping them from relieving [[Fingon|Fingon's]] forces in the west and allowing the vast army Morgoth's enemies had assembled to be destroyed piecemeal. Though the [[Easterlings#Sons_of_B.C3.B3r|House of Bór]] hunted down and slew many of Ulfang's treacherous clan, the damage was done: The Treachery of Men effectively lost the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] and their allies the battle (to what degree depending on which version: see [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]) and the deed was the cause for the estrangement of the Easterlings and other Mannish groups (except the [[Edain]]) from the Elves.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
