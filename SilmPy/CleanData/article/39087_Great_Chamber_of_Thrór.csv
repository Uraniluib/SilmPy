The '''Great Chamber of Thrór''' was the hall of feasting and council in the mountain-realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name="Home">{{H|Home}}</ref> When [[Thorin and Company]] (including [[Bilbo Baggins]]) came upon the chamber in {{TA|2941}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> its great doors were half burnt and hanging twisted upon their hinges. The floor of the room was filled with rotting tables, overturned chairs and benches, flagons, bowls, broken drinking horns, skulls, and bones, all covered with dust. Far above came a glimmer of light from unseen openings. The light grew brighter at the further end where the company found the birth-place of the [[River Running]], which was but a short distance from the entrance to the Mountain.<ref name="Home"/>

The Great Chamber was probably named after [[Thrór]] after he became king in {{TA|2589}}.<ref name="TA"/> Its ruined state testifies that it was one of the scenes of destruction during the [[Sack of Erebor]] in {{TA|2770}}.<ref name="TA"/>
