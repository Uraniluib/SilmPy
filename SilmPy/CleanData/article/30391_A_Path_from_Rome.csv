==From the Publisher==

{{blockquote|This frank and lively autobiography of a man who ultimately left the Catholic church to become a philosophy professor at Oxford, sheds light on the rigors of seminary life, the rigid Latin teaching at the Gregorian University, and the Spartan pleasures of the English College in Rome. An in-depth account of a personal love affair with Catholicism, the book tackles some of the most important moral questions of our day.}}
