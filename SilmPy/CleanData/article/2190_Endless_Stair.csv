'''Endless Stair''' was the winding stairway that led from the deepest halls of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] up to [[Durin's Tower]] on the peak of [[Celebdil]].  It was extremely long, thus its name.  

In the late [[Third Age]] it was presumed to have been lost or destroyed and even some [[Dwarves]] thought that it was legendary. [[Gandalf]] the wizard proved it not so when he pursued [[Durin's Bane]] up it to the peak.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>
