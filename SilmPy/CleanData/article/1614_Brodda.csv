'''Brodda''' was an [[Easterlings|Easterling]] from the House of [[Ulfang]]. 

== History ==
During the [[First Age]], after [[Morgoth]] captured the land of [[Hithlum]], Brodda became its lord. He took to wife (against her will) [[Aerin]] of the [[House of Hador]], a kinswoman of [[Húrin]], and took Húrin's lands and possessions.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 68</ref> When in {{FA|495}}<ref>{{GA|288}}</ref> [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], son of Húrin, returned to [[Dor-lómin]], he learned from Aerin that his mother, [[Morwen]], had left [[Hithlum]]. In his rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who burnt herself alive in her [[Brodda's hall|hall]], and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] now was persecuted even more cruelly.<ref>{{CH|12}}, pp. 188-190</ref>
