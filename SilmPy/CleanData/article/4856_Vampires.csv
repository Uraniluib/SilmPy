'''Vampires''' were mysterious bat-like creatures in the service of [[Morgoth]] and of [[Sauron]]. The only vampire whose name is recorded in the annals of [[Arda]] is [[Sauron]]'s servant [[Thuringwethil]], but Sauron himself took the form of a vampire on at least one occasion, to flee [[Huan]].<ref>{{S|19}}</ref>
