The '''Hornrock''' was a black spur of rock that stood out southward from the northern rock-wall of [[Helm's Deep]]. It was on the crest of the Hornrock that the castle of the [[Hornburg]] was built, and from it the [[Deeping Wall]] ran across the Deep's mouth to the southern wall.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>
