'''The Tongue''' was the narrow strip of land at end of [[Egladil]], forming the tip where the [[Celebrant]] flowed into the Great River [[Anduin]].

The Tongue itself was south-eastern tip of the Angle (or Egladil) in [[Lothlórien]], specifically the place where the two rivers met.<ref>{{TI|XIVviii}}, note 5</ref> It was a completely treeless, being covered in a green lawn with the bright golden ''[[elanor (flower)|elanor]]''. On the southern bank was a landing-place for bets to set out onto the Celebrant and beyond to either river; it was here where [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] held a farewell feast for the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], before they departed via the Anduin.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>
