''"Therefore when Eldacar succeeded his father there was war in Gondor. but Eldacar did not prove easy to thrust from his heritage. To the lineage of Gondor he added the fearless spirit of the Northmen. He was handsome and valiant, and showed no sign of ageing more swiftly than his father...''

''At last he was besieged in Osgiliath, and held it long, until hunger and the greater forces of the rebels drove him out, leaving the city in flames. In that siege and burning the Tower of the Stone of Osgiliath was destroyed, and the palant√≠r was lost in the waters."'' - The Return of the King 

In a role playing game, you assume the role of a character in a "living" novel. Middle-earth Role Playing (MERP) and its companion sourcebooks provide the framework for role playing in the greatest fantasy setting of all time... J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. 

The Middle-earth Role Playing Combat Screen is a must for all MERP gamers! Included are all the MERP tables needed for battles, maneuvering, and action. All this on one 34" x 11" combat screen plus two 17" x 11" reference sheets that can double as screen extenders.
