'''Gelion''' was a river of [[Middle-earth]] in the [[First Age]], the principal river of [[East Beleriand]], being the border of [[Beleriand]] and [[Ossiriand]].

The vale of Gelion sloped steadily southward and thus had neither falls nor rapids, yet was ever swifter than the River [[Sirion]].  Although Gelion was twice the length of Sirion it was less wide and full, for more rain fell in the west than in the east.

==Course==
Its two sources were at the hill of [[Himring]], via the [[Little Gelion]], and [[Mount Rerir]], via the [[Greater Gelion]] (which also had a tributary connected to [[Lake Helevorn]]). 

It then flowed south for forty leagues,<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> dividing [[Estolad]] to the west from [[Thargelion]] to the east.  Gelion met [[Sarn Athrad]] ("Ford of Stones") just above the inflow of the River [[Ascar]].  Gelion then became the western border of [[Ossiriand]], the Land of Seven Rivers, from which it was fed by the rivers [[Ascar]], [[Thalos]], [[Legolin]], [[Brilthor]], [[Duilwen]], and [[Adurant]], all rising in the [[Ered Luin]].  Gelion then turned southwest, passing by [[Taur-im-Duinath]] (the Forest between the Rivers) before emptying into the Great Sea [[Belegaer]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
Between the arms of Gelion lay the ward of [[Maglor]].  [[Caranthir]] made his abode at Lake Helevorn, and the land of Thargelion, which signified the Land beyond Gelion, was also called [[Dor Caranthir]], the Land of Caranthir.<ref name="Beleriand"/>

Due to the open nature of the land about the upper reaches of the River Gelion the region was subjected to many battles.  [[Haldad]] of the [[Haladin]] built a stockade in the corner formed by the Gelion and the Ascar when an orc-raid fell upon his people in Thargelion.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>  During the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the dragon [[Glaurung]] came and destroyed all the land between the arms of Gelion.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>  Eventually the lands between the rivers [[Aros]] and Gelion became so dangerous that [[Dwarves]] traveling to and from the Ered Luin and [[Menegroth]] stopping going in small parties but went in great companies well armed.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
