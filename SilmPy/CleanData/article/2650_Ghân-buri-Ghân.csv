__NOTOC__
==History==
He was the son of [[Ghân]] with whom he shared his name, and became the chief of his tribe. 

During the [[War of the Ring]], Ghân-buri-Ghân helped King [[Théoden]] and the [[Rohirrim]] to avoid an army of [[Orcs]] by taking them through the secret pass of [[Stonewain Valley]]. This allowed the Rohirrim to arrive in time to fight the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In return, Théoden promised that the people of [[Rohan]] would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the ''[[Gorgûn]]'' (Orcs), that hunted them.<ref name="Ride"/>

Following the War of the Ring, [[Aragorn]], as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], issued the decree that Drúadan Forest belonged to only Ghân and his people, and that no one else was allowed to enter the forest without their permission.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>
