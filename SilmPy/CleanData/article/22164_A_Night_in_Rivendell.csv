'''''A Night In Rivendell''''' is the second album by the Danish group [[Tolkien Ensemble]], released in April [[2000]]. It features songs composed to the lyrics found in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and forms the second part of what was to become a complete musical interpretation of all lyrics in the book (a project given approval by both the [[Tolkien Estate]] and [[HarperCollins]]).

The album features cover art by [[Margrethe II of Denmark]].
