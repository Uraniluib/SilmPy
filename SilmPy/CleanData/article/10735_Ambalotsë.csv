An '''ambalotsë''' was a crested helm, especially one worn by a [[Elves|Elf]]-lord in battle. The crest was typically of a flower or flowers.

Ambalotsë means "Uprising Flower" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[amba]]'' = "upwards" and ''[[lótë]]'' = "flower"). This style of helm was called ''[[amloth]]'' in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{WJ|Maeglin}}, p. 318</ref>
