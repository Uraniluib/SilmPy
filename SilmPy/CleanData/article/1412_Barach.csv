'''Barach''' was one of the [[Folk of Haleth]] who dwelt in the Forest of [[Brethil]] during the [[First Age]]. He and his family had the friendship of a [[Drúedain|Drúadan]] named [[Aghan]], and at a time when [[Orcs]] were prowling the woodlands, [[Aghan]] watched the homestead of his friend [[Barach]] through each night. 

The story of [[The Faithful Stone]] describes the events that unfolded when [[Aghan]] was forced to leave Barach and his family unprotected for a time. In his place, the [[Drúedain|Drûg]] left a carved 'watch-stone', and unknown to Barach he passed some of his own power into it, so that it could truly guard the house. 

While [[Aghan]] was away, Barach was indeed attacked by [[Orcs]], who attempted to burn down his home. The fire was stamped out by a Drûg - apparently the stone come alive - and the [[Orcs]] were driven away. When [[Aghan]] returned the following day, he found the scorched and broken carving, and Barach saw that his friend, too, had been injured - a result of passing part of his power into the watch-stone.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>
