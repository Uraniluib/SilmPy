'''The Stock-brook''' was a brook of [[the Shire]]'s [[Eastfarthing]], and a minor tributary of the River [[Brandywine]]. It rose in the forested hills above [[Woody End]], and from there flowed north-eastwards out into the fields of the [[Marish]]. It passed through the southern end of the village of [[Stock]], from which it took its name, before emptying into the Brandywine a few miles north of [[Bucklebury Ferry]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

On [[25 September]] {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] crossed the Stock-brook on their journey to [[Farmer Maggot|Farmer Maggot's]] house.<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[David Salo]] suggested the name represents a possible "[[Old English|Old Hobbitish]]" ''Se Stocbroc''.

As it gets its name from the village of Stock, its meaning is "the brook running through Stock".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
