'''Adanedhel''' was another name for [[Túrin]], the son of [[Húrin]] and [[Morwen]].  Although a [[Men|Man]], he had been raised from childhood in the halls of King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]].  When, later in his life, he dwelt among the [[Elves]] of [[Nargothrond]], they recognised the nobility he had acquired in [[Thingol]]'s kingdom, and gave him the name [[Adanedhel]], meaning 'Elf-man' (''[[Adan]]'' means "man" and ''[[edhel]]'' means "elf").<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 164</ref>
