==From the publisher==

''Songs of Sorrow and Hope: The Art of Jenny Dolfen'' is a rich, visual journey that celebrates over a decade of work by renowned German fantasy artist, Jenny Dolfen.

In a showcase of more than fifty illustrations, this book guides fantasy fans and art enthusiasts alike through an exploration of Jenny's artistic output, accompanied by narratives, reflections and insights from the artist herself. 

Jenny Dolfen is known for bringing to life characters from Celtic fantasy, the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkien, and traditional folk tales. Working in traditional media such as watercolours and pencil, combined with digital media, her flowing artistic style reflects a blending of such influences as the Art Nouveau movement, the illustrations of Arthur Rackham, and the aesthetics of contemporary graphic novel illustration.
