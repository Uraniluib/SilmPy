==Summary==
===Foreword: Aiding the Order===
[[Gandalf]] thanks the player for the work done for the people of [[Bree-land]]. He informs the player that he learned from [[Gwaihir|Gwaihir the Windlord]] that [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] discovered corruption in the [[Lone-lands]]. He urges the player to find him with much haste. He suggests to the player to talk to [[Saeradan]], a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]], to help track down Radagast.

When the player talks to Saeradan, he states that he does not know where Radagast can be found. He suggests to the player to talk to [[Candaith]] the Ranger of the North who looks over the [[Lone-lands]].

===Chapter 1: Rise of the Orcs===
[[Candaith]] informs the player that he just returned from the lands to the east, lands controlled by the forces of evil. He discovered camps of [[Goblins]] to the south and a band of [[Orcs]] of the [[White Hand]] to the north in the [[Weather Hills]]. He asks the player for help driving off the Orcs and he will help find [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]].

===Chapter 2: An Orc Messenger===
The player reports back to [[Candaith]] that some of the [[Orcs]] of the [[White Hand]] have been driven back from the north. In his search for [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] he spotted an Orc-messenger near the [[Midgewater Marshes|Midgewater Pass]]. He attempted to track the Orc as he headed south-east, but lost him after he hid from some ''[[crebain]]'' circling above.

He said he would continue his search for Radagast while the player attempted to find the message he delivered. He suggests looking for the message that he gave to the Orc-camp Glumhallow to the west.

===Chapter 3: War-master Uzorr===
The player returns back to [[Candaith]] with the message. He informs the player that he learned that the [[Orcs]] of the [[White Hand]] located in [[Weather Hills]] are being led by the Orc War-master [[Uzorr]].

Candaith expects that Uzorr is in Bleakrift within the [[Midgewater Marshes|Midgewater Pass]]. He requests the player to slay the War-master and to search for a letter. The slaying of Uzorr will cause a great reduction in the Orc moral in Weather Hills. 

He states that he will continue his search for [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]].

===Chapter 4: Light in the Darkness===
The player informs [[Candaith]] that [[Uzorr]] was slain and orders were found in his encampment. While Candaith was looking for [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] he noticed flashes of white light coming form over [[Weathertop]] in the night sky. He asks the player to search the ruins atop Weathertop and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.

The player finds some strange runes carved in a rock. The player takes a rubbing of the markings.

===Chapter 5: Retake Weathertop===
[[Candaith]] states that he has news of [[Radagast]], but he must ask for the player's aid one last time. The orders that were given to [[Uzorr]] state that the [[Uruk-hai]] are planning to take control of [[Amon Sûl]] under cover of night. Candaith wishes to attack them before they do so and defeat [[Rigûl]], their leader.

The player along with the help of the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] Candaith work their way up the narrow path to Amon Sûl, fighting small band of [[Goblins]] along the way. The path forks about half way up the side of [[Weathertop]]. 

Candaith takes the path to the right while the player takes the path to the left. The player fights off one band of [[Orcs]] lead by the Orc War-master [[Bûb-hosh]] and then another band of Orcs further up the path lead by the Orc War-master [[Muz]]. 

The player continues up and meets up with Candaith. He says that he is injured and cannot go on. The player confronts the Uruk-hai War-master Rigûl without the aid of the Ranger. 

===Chapter 6: Protected by the Eglain===
[[Candaith]] says that he tracked [[Radagast]] and found that he made friends with the [[Eglain]], [[Men]] made some ruins in the [[Lone-lands]] their home. The Eglain are a solitary and quiet people, having shunned societal obligation for a simple life. Because of this nature, they are wary of anyone who wishes to traffic with them or their allies, and it seems that Radagast has enlisted their aid. but at some time in the distant past.

Candaith states that the player must first earn the trust before they will provide you an audience with Radagast. He suggests you talk to [[Gadaric Munce]] at [[the Forsaken Inn]].

===Chapter 7: Radagast the Brown===
After the player has earned the trust of the [[Eglain]].<ref>This is accomplished with doing quests that grant reputation among the Eglain. These are side quests are not part of the epic story line.</ref> [[Gadaric Munce]] informs the player that [[Radagast]] has taken residence in a tower in the ruins of [[Ost Guruth]], the place the Eglain call home.

===Chapter 8: The Red Swamp===
The player is informed by [[Radagast]] that he has noticed that the [[bog-prowlers]] are becoming twisted shadows of their former selves. He wishes to inspect the moss that they line their nests with to determine what is fouling the land. He asks the player not to harm the bog-prowlers.
