The '''Pelóri''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[peˈloːri]}}) were the mountain-fence of [[Aman]]. The highest peak of the Pelóri was [[Taniquetil]], on which were the mansions of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].

==History==
The Pelóri were raised by the [[Valar]] to defend against the evils of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] after he destroyed their original dwelling-place at [[Almaren]].

They were the tallest of all mountains, and the tallest of the [[Pelóri]] was [[Taniquetil]], on which stood the high mansions of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]]. Behind them to the West, the Light of the Trees shone, but the narrow shores beneath their eastern feet were in darkness.

The second highest of the Pelóri was [[Hyarmentir]] above [[Avathar]].

When the [[Eldar]] came to [[Aman]], the Valar cut a rift in the Mountains, the [[Calacirya]], to let the Light shine through them. In that pass, the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] built the city of [[Tirion]], and the Pass of Light looked out onto the [[Bay of Eldamar]] and lit the isle of [[Tol Eressëa]], where the [[Teleri]] dwelt in those ancient days.

==Etymology==
The [[Quenya]] name ''Pelóri'' translates as "the fencing or defensive heights".<ref name=SI/> In a manuscript, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] connects the name to [[Quenya]] ''pelo'' ("a boundary (fence)") and ''pella'' ("beyond"), deriving from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[PEL|PELE]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 92</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested that the first element derives from ''[[PEL|pel-]]'' ("fence, enclosure").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> The second element is likely ''[[orot|or]]'', "mountain".

The Pelóri were also called the '''Mountains of Aman''' and the '''Mountains of Defence'''.<ref name=SI>{{S|Index}}</ref>

==In other stories==
The Pelóri - as the Mountains of Elvenholme - are referenced in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]''. In the story, written down in [[1927]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes the enchanted dog [[Rover|Roverandom]] (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the [[Shadowy Seas]] to the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Fairyland]] beyond the [[Enchanted Isles|Magic Isles]] where Rover saw the Mountains of Elvenhome and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of [[Tirion|a city of Elves on a green hill far away in the distance]].<ref name="Roverandom">{{HM|R}}, pp. 73-4</ref>
