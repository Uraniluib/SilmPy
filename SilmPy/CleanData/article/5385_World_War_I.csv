[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] served in the British Army during '''World War I''' (or the "'''Great War'''"), most notably in the bloody [[Battle of the Somme]]. The earliest works of the [[Legendarium]]&mdash;collected in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''&mdash;were began during the conflict. The extent to which the war and Tolkien's experience of it are reflected in his written work is a matter of much interest in Tolkien scholarship.
