'''Finarfin''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[fiˈnarfin]}}) was the youngest child and son of [[Finwë]] and [[Indis]]. After the [[Flight of the Noldor]] he remained in [[Tirion]] and ruled the Noldor who remained in [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Finarfin''</ref>

==History==
Finarfin was born in [[Valinor]] in {{YT|1230}}.<ref>{{MR|P2j}}, p. 92</ref>  He was the youngest of the five children of [[Finwë]], the [[High King of the Noldor]].  Finarfin's mother was [[Indis]], Finwë's second wife.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>  Finarfin's full siblings were [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], and [[Írimë]] while his half-brother was the great [[Elves|Elf]] Lord [[Fëanor]].  Fëanor disapproved of his father's second marriage and had little love for Indis and her children, although Finarfin remained far from those disputes.<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref>

In {{YT|1280}} Finarfin married [[Eärwen]], daughter of [[Olwë]], King of the [[Teleri]] in [[Valinor]].<ref>{{MR|P2j}}, p. 92</ref> They had four children: [[Finrod]], [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]] and [[Galadriel]].<ref group="note">[[Orodreth]] appears as one of Finarfin's sons in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] writings, however, he was clearly marked as [[Angrod]]'s son. [[Christopher Tolkien]], the editor of ''The Silmarillion'', later admitted the mistake.</ref><ref>{{PM|Gil-galad}}, pp. 349-351</ref> Finarfin's mother was of the [[Vanyar]], and he inherited her fair hair, which he passed on to his children.<ref>{{PM|Case}}, p. 336</ref> The Elves of the '''[[House of Finarfin]]''' were unique among their kin who had dark hair.

In {{YT|1495}}.<ref>{{MR|P2j}}, p. 100</ref> [[Morgoth|Melkor]] destroyed the [[Two Trees]],<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> slaughtered Finarfin's father Finwë, and stole the [[Silmarils]] of Fëanor.  Enraged, Fëanor came to the city of [[Tirion|Tirion upon Túna]] and convinced many of his kinsmen to leave Valinor for [[Middle-earth]], to recover the Silmarils and defeat Morgoth.  Fëanor was a charismatic speaker, but Fingolfin and Finarfin were unmoved. However they too followed their half-brother, more for their children who eagerly accepted his cause.

The [[Noldor]] followed Fëanor in groups, and Fingolfin and Finarfin led the last host. As such they did not participate in the [[First Kinslaying]] or know its true cause at the time. While they were travelling up the coast of [[Araman]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Mandos]] appeared and pronounced the [[Doom of Mandos|Doom of the Noldor]]. Finarfin, dismayed by the prophecy and already contemplating return because of the tragedy of the Kinslaying of his wife's people at [[Alqualondë]], returned to Valinor with a small group of his people; his sons, though, would not forsake the sons of Fingolfin and went on.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

Eventually Finarfin came to [[Middle-earth]], leading the Valinorean Noldor in the [[War of Wrath]], near the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> The fairest and wisest of the sons of Finwe, he presumably still rules the few remaining Noldor in Valinor from Tirion upon [[Túna]].

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Finarfin.mp3|Ardamir}}
Finarfin's [[father-name]] was '''Arafinwë''' ([[Quenya|Q]]:"Noble [son of] Finwë", pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˌaraˈfinwe]}},[[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˌaraˈɸinwe]}}).<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p.344</ref> His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''Ingoldo''', changed from the earlier Ingalaurë ("[[Vanyar|Inga]]-gold", pron.{{IPA|[ˌiŋɡaˈlaʊ̯re]}}).<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, note 30, p. 360</ref>

The name ''Finarfin'' is the [[Sindarin]] version of his father-name.

Finarfin is rare among the [[High Elves]] of the [[Undying Lands]] who did not leave and fall under the [[Doom of Mandos]], in that he is known primarily by his name in Sindarin, a language indigenous to [[Middle-earth]] and not thought to have been known or studied in Aman until after the Exiles were allowed to return at the end of the [[First Age]], save the possibility that Sindarin was learned from the Elves of [[Beleriand]] who died and went to sojourn in the [[Halls of Mandos]].  Other such Amanya High Elves who stayed behind are primarily known by their [[Quenya]] or [[Telerin]] names.  But both of Finarfin's brothers went into Exile, with the result that both were largely remembered by Sindarin names, and also Finarfin's name is structured very similarly to that of his brother [[Fingolfin]].

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
Finarfin was called [[Finrod]] in earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], and his son was named '''[[Inglor Felagund]]'''. As such he appears in the 1st edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Finrod. This was changed in later editions, but not all references to '''Inglor''' were removed, since in the later version, it is probably the Sindarin version of '''Ingalaurë'''. (see [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]]).

In some early works, his name is spelled "Finarphin".<ref>{{MR|P4}}</ref> An early version of [[Appendix F]], mentions the "royal house of Finarphir" which was corrected in later editions.<ref>The form "Finarphir" has an entry in {{HM|Guide}}</ref>
