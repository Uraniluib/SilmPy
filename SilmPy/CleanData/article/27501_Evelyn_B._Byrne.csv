'''Evelyn B. Byrne''' was an American who in 1967-70 ran a program for New York City's Elizabeth Barrett Browning Junior High School, where she asked major literary and artistic figures (including [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]) of the time to write back with their recollections of what books inspired them while they were teenagers. An assortment of their responses were collected into the book ''[[Attacks of Taste]]''.<ref>[http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wordpress/archives/132 Tolkien Collector's Guide], as of June 25, 2010</ref>
