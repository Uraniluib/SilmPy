'''Grof''' is a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] from the [[Blue Mountains]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. He appears on the marketplace of [[Bree]], where he sells several goods. He was asked by a [[Bree-men|man of Bree]], [[Otto Aster]], to sell weapons to him, so he could arm the towns of [[Bree-land]]. Grof originally refused, but after [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] talked with him, on the request of Otto, he changed his view. Grof then returned to his home in the Blue Mountains to forge weapons for the [[Bree-landers]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Forewarned is Forearmed''</ref>
