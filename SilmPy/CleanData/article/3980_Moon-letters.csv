'''Moon-letters''' were a method of writing invented by the [[Dwarves]]. Moon-letters were ordinary [[Runes]], but written in such a way that they could only be read when the light of the [[moon]] shone behind the writing.  Some moon-letters could be read by any moonlight, but it was possible to make the writing even more secret.  More sophisticated moon-letters could only be read by the light of the same shape of moon, or at the same time of year, as when they were written. 

Moon-letters were written with silver pens.<ref name="Rest">{{H|Rest}}</ref>  The substance [[Ithildin]], made from ''[[mithril]]'', reflected only starlight and moonlight,<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref> and it seems likely that ithildin, or something very similar, was used by the Dwarves to write their moon-letters.

An example of moon-letters was found by [[Elrond]] on [[Thr√≥r's Map]] of the [[Lonely Mountain]] and surrounding areas that [[Gandalf]] had given [[Thorin]] in {{TA|2941}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  The moon letters were of the more cunning type had been written on a Midsummer's eve under a crescent moon.  They said:

:"''Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the key-hole.''"<ref name="Rest"/>
