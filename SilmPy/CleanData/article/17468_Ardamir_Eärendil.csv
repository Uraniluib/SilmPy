{{disambig-two|the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of [[Eärendil]]|[[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] royal|[[Ardamir (son of Axantur)]]}}

'''Ardamir''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "[[Arda]]-jewel", pron. {{IPA|[ˈardamir]}}, stem ''Ardamír-'') or '''[[Arda]][[mírë]]''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌardaˈmiːre]}}) is the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of [[Eärendil]], son of [[Idril]] and [[Tuor]].

Even if the [[Edain]] and the [[Noldor]] were not lovers of the sea or of ships, Tuor named his son ''Eärendil'', "sea-lover", because [[Ulmo]] had foretold him that if he found [[Gondolin]], "he would there beget a son ever afterwards renowned as a mariner". But Idril's choice of mother-name was even more prophetic, for she "could not foresee in her waking mind the strange fate" that led Eärendil to [[Aman]] and at last to the skies with the [[Silmaril]] on his brow.
