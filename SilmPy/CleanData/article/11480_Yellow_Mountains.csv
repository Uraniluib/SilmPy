The '''Yellow Mountains''' were a range of mountains to the south-east of [[Middle-earth]] within the [[Dark Land|Southlands]], a southern continuation of the [[Orocarni|Red Mountains]]. Both ranges were created when the [[Valar]] thrust the centre of Middle-earth to the east as extra protection for [[Valinor]].<ref>{{SM|5b}} p. 239</ref>

In the [[Ambarkanta maps]], the Yellow Mountains are not shown on Map V, labelled ''"After the [[War for the Sake of the Elves|War of the Gods]]"''.
