'''''A Secret Vice''''' is the title of a lecture apparently held by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in August [[1930]] at an [[Esperanto]] Congress in [[Oxford]].<ref name=RG/> The lecture deals with constructed languages in general, and the relation of a mythology to its language. Tolkien contrasts auxiliary languages (like Esperanto) with artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure.<ref name=MC6>{{MC|6}}</ref>

The title (consisting of a phrase occuring in the lecture) was created by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the publication of the lecture manuscript in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]''.<ref>{{MC|F}}</ref> Tolkien himself referred to the lecture as "A Secret Vice" in a letter.<ref>{{L|294}}</ref>

==Summary==

Tolkien begins by briefly discussing Esperanto but states that the topic of his lecture rather concerns "secret" languages. As an example of such a language, he first recalls an incident where he overheard a man working on his own "secret grammar" while Tolkien was in the army in the [[World War I|First World War]]. He then continues by mentioning and analysing two constructed languages: the children's play-languages [[Animalic]] and [[Nevbosh]]. The next constructed language discussed is [[Naffarin]], a more advanced, private language "partly overlapping the last stages of ''Nevbosh''". Finally, Tolkien discusses the languages he created for his [[legendarium|mythology]] and gives examples of his [[Elvish]] poetry (with translations in English).<ref name=MC6/>

Included in the lecture are:
*a fragment in [[Nevbosh]]
*a fragment in [[Naffarin]]
*the poem [[Oilima Markirya]] (in [[Qenya]])<ref name=PE16>{{PE|16}}, p. 98</ref>
*the poem [[Nieninque]] (in Qenya)<ref name=PE16/>
*the poem [[Earendel at the Helm]] (in Qenya)<ref name=PE16/>
*a fragment in [[Noldorin]] (beginning with "Dir avosaith a gwaew hinar")<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 882-3</ref>
