<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The bearer of the ring, the wearer of the ring
Stands on the very brink of fate;
Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
That rise and shrink with hate.

The bearer of the ring, the wearer of the ring,
He hears a voice compelling him;
Filling him with thoughts that echo in his mind
It should be telling him.

Beware, the power is a power never known.
Beware, the power that was simple has now grown.
Beware, O, bearer of the ring,
The final power has yet to be shown!

The bearer of the ring, the wearer of the ring,
Through voices tempting to resist,
Must recall the quest to end this darkest age
That mortal death has kissed.

The bearer of the ring, the wearer of the ring,
Beware who wears the ring!

The bearer of the ring, the wearer of the ring,
He hears a voice compelling him;
Filling him with thoughts that echo in his mind
It should be telling him.

Beware, the power is a power never known.
Beware, the power that was simple has now grown.
Beware, O, bearer of the ring,
The final power has yet to be shown!
