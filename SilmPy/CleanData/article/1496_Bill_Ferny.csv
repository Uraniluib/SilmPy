'''Bill Ferny''' was a man of [[Bree]].

==History==
Bill Ferny lived on the last house of Bree, and was an opportunistic backstabber, who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He served as a spy for the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], and relayed information about Shire-hobbits to them.

Ferny was at [[the Prancing Pony]] on [[September 29]]th when his colleague, a [[Squint-eyed Southerner]] joined him. The two of them saw "[[Mr. Underhill]]" ([[Frodo Baggins]]) vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the [[Nazgûl]], and the Ringwraiths came to attack that night.<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

After the Ringwraiths raided ''The Prancing Pony'', Bill and his allies went to the inn's stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Bree: [[Bill the Pony|Bill's mistreated one]]. He sold him for twelve [[silver pennies]] to [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]]. As a parting gift, [[Samwise Gamgee]] threw an [[apples|apple]] at his head.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

The Squint-eyed Southerner was spotted inside Bill Ferny's house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name="FRI11">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

When trouble came up the [[Greenway]] from the South, Bill Ferny and several others opened the gates to them, and left with them after a short battle.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> He joined [[Saruman|Sharkey]], and guarded the gate at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. His command over the local Shirriffs was hard, but he was no match for the [[Travellers|four Hobbits]] who tried to break in. He fled into the night, but not after his old pony had kicked him in the back.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bill'' is a name Tolkien used to represent the [[Westron]] name '''Bil''', which was a short for names as ''Arambil'', ''Bildad'' and ''Bilcuzal'', all of unknown meaning.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> ''Ferny'' is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Fern|plant]], as many surnames of [[Bree]] were botanical in nature.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>
