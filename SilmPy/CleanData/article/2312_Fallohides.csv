'''Fallohides''' were one of three original divisions of hobbit-kind, along with the [[Harfoots]] and [[Stoors]]. The Fallohides were the least numerous of the three branches, and originally dwelt in the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
In appearance, Fallohides were taller and slimmer of build than the other [[Hobbits]], with some growing to four feet or more in height. Both their skin and their hair tended to be fair, and no Fallohide ever grew a beard.

While the other two branches of hobbit-kind were pastoral and rustic in nature, the Fallohides retained a hunting tradition, and so were naturally bolder and more inquisitive than their relatives, but less gifted in the arts of farming and agriculture.<ref name="hobbits"/>

As Fallohidish culture was much more open to outside influence than that of the Stoors or Harfoots, they were friendlier with the other [[Portal:Characters|races]] of [[Middle-earth]] than their cousins, especially with the [[Elves]]. Perhaps because of this, they were skilled in both song and speech, and were lovers of trees and of woodlands.<ref name="hobbits"/>

==History==
The Fallohides seem to have dwelt originally on the upper reaches of the River [[Anduin]], in the region where the [[Greylin]] and the [[Langwell]] flowed into the [[Anduin|Great River]]. It is likely that they mixed with the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]] at this time, for the [[Northmen]] also dwelt in this region, and this is likely the origin of the legend of the [[Holbytla|Holbytlan]] found in [[Rohan]]<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>.

At the end of the first millennium of the [[Third Age]], evil things began to stir in the east of Middle-earth, and many peoples, including the ancestral Hobbits, began to travel westward across the [[Misty Mountains]]. The first Hobbits to enter [[Eriador]] were the Harfoots; the Fallohides deserted their northern homes in around {{TA|1150}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> and crossed the Mountains to the north of [[Rivendell]], at the sources of the River [[Hoarwell]].<ref name="hobbits"/>

The tribes of the Fallohidish Hobbits travelled slowly down the course of the Hoarwell, and westward across [[Eriador]]. They eventually settled in the region around [[Bree]], in c.{{TA|1300}},<ref name="TA"/> where their adventurous and intrepid natures made them natural leaders of the other Hobbits they found there. It was presumably at about this time that the three strains of Hobbits began to mix freely for the first time.

Three hundred years later (in the year {{TA|1601}})<ref name="TA"/>, two Fallohide brothers, [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]], travelled westward again from Bree with their followers and crossed the Bridge of Stonebows (later the [[Brandywine Bridge]]). They settled in the empty land that they found there and were granted it by King [[Argeleb II]] of [[Arthedain]], in whose realm it lay. This was the land that was to become known as [[the Shire]].<ref name="hobbits"/>

As the centuries passed, the three distinct strains of the Hobbits gradually began to disappear as they mingled with one another in the Shire. Nonetheless, there were families that retained a strong line of Fallohidish blood, and the impetuosity that went with it. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the Fallohidish line was still well represented in the families of the [[Took Family|Tooks]], the [[Bolger Family|Bolgers]] and the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]].<ref name="hobbits"/>

In some old families, especially those of Fallohide origin it was, the custom to give high-sounding first-names such as [[Isengrim (disambiguation)|Isengrim]].<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Fallohide'' is a translation of an archaic [[Hobbitish]] word.

The word derived from the archaic English words ''fallow'', meaning "pale, yellowish" (not now in use, except in "fallow deer"), and ''hide'' (which is no longer applied to human skin). In modern English, ''Fallohide'' would be rendered as 'Paleskin'.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>
