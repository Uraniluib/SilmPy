'''Amalion''' was the name of a [[trees|tree]], which [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] regularly drew in illustrations.<ref name=AI>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 64-5</ref><ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 129, n. 1</ref> The name does not appear in any of the stories of the [[legendarium]].

==Etymology==

[[Carl F. Hostetter]] has suggested that the name ''Amalion'' derives from "[[Quenya]] ''amalya'' 'rich, blessed', from ''amal'' 'riches, blessing, bliss, good fortune', related to a later form, ''alam'', with the same meaning, and also ''alam'' '[[Elms|elm-tree]]' as in ''[[The Etymologies]]''".<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 67, n. 74</ref>

==Other works==

[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have suggested that Amalion is related to the "Tree of Tales" in ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'' and [[Niggle]]'s Tree in ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]''. A version of the tree was used as cover art for ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.<ref name=AI/>
