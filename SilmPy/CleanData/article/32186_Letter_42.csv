==Summary==
Michael Tolkien served with a gun-battery during the [[wikipedia:Battle of Britain|Battle of Britain]] and had been injured in an accident during night training.  J.R.R. Tolkien sent him many letters while he convalesced in a Worcester hospital.  In this letter, Tolkien chatted about the weather and an amusing visit to a pub.  He stated that air raid warnings were frequent but so far no bombing had occurred in the area.  He believed that more hectic times were coming, since reasoning seemed to show that Hitler must attack Britain directly and very heavily before the summer.  Tolkien invoked Godâ€™s blessing on his son, told him that he prayed for him constantly, and asked if Michael needed anything specially.
