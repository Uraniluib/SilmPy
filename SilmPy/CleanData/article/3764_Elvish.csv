'''Elvish''' (''Quenderin'')<ref>{{PE|18}}, page 72</ref> is a word that refers to any of the languages of the [[Elves]], or all of them collectively. All of the Elven languages descend from the [[Primitive Quendian]].

During the [[Third Age]] the term "Elvish" usually referred specifically to [[Sindarin]] since it was the most common vernacular of the Elves. 

The [[Hobbits]] referred to the Elvish languages as "languages of the [[Kings of Arnor|kings]]" and few of them knew them.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
==Tree of the Elvish languages==
Major splits and variations were a result of the [[Great Journey]] of the Elves in the [[First Age]], and the other migrations of the following millennia.

*'''[[Primitive Quendian]]''' (language of the Elves in [[Cuiviénen]])
**'''[[Avarin]]'''
***'''Various Avarin languages''' (some later merged with Nandorin)
**'''[[Common Eldarin]]''' (the early language of all the [[Eldar]])
***'''[[Quenya]]''' (the language of the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] and the [[Vanyar]])
****''' ''[[Vanyarin|Quendya]]'' (also ''Vanyarin Quenya'') ''' (daily tongue of the Vanyar: closest to archaic Quenya)
****''' ''[[Noldorin|Ñoldorin Quenya]]'' (also ''Exilic Quenya'') ''' (the "Elven Latin" of Middle-earth)
***'''[[Common Telerin]]''' (the early language of all the [[Lindar]])
****'''[[Telerin]]''' (the language of the [[Teleri]] who reached the [[Undying Lands]]; considered a dialect of Quenya, although of different branch)
****'''[[Nandorin]]''' (languages of the [[Nandor]] &mdash; some were influenced by Avarin)
*****'''Original language of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]'''
*****'''Original language of [[Lothlórien|Lórinand]]'''
****'''[[Sindarin]]''' (language of the [[Sindar]])
*****'''[[Doriathrin]]''' (dialect of [[Doriath]])
*****'''[[Falathrin]]''' (dialect of the [[Falas]] and [[Nargothrond]])
*****'''[[North Sindarin]]''' (dialects of [[Dorthonion]] and [[Hithlum]])

The Elves made use of the [[Tengwar]] and [[Cirth]] scripts for their languages.

===Pronunciation===
Tolkien used the Roman alphabet to write the names and words of Elvish origin in his works. Sindarin and Quenya have in most aspects very much the same rules in his spelling of the names. Tolkien used the Roman letters having in mind "neutral" values, close to their original Latin ones: open, consistent and straightforward pronunciation, without glides.

It's important to remember that, while most samples of the Elvish language are written with the Latin alphabet, within the fiction the languages were written using [[Tengwar]], or occasionally carved in [[Cirth]].

The following table gives pronunciation for each letter or cluster in international phonetic script and examples:

====Consonants==== 
(Only those differing from English are mentioned)
* The letter ''c'' is always pronounced like the letter ''k'', even before ''i'' and ''e''.; for instance, ''[[Celeborn]]'' is pronounced ''Keleborn'', and [[Cirth]] is pronounced ''Kirth''.
**The letter ''k'', is attested in early, unpublished manuscripts by Tolkien, before he settled on ''c''. It can still be found by exception on some published names such as ''[[Ekkaia]]'', although it would be identical with *''Eccaia''; the difference between the two letters is '''only''' aesthetic. 
**Also, note that ''k'' is used by tradition to [[asterisk]]ed [[Primitive Quendian]] and [[Old Sindarin]] words, in order to differentiate them from later forms.
* The letter ''g'' is never pronounced in the soft form, as in ''giant''.  For instance, ''Region'' is pronounced unlike the English word ''region''.
* The letter ''r'' is lightly trilled, as in Spanish.
* The digraph ''dh'', as in ''Caradhras'', is pronounced like the ''th'' in ''this''.
* The digraph ''ch'', as in ''Orch'', is pronounced as in German ''ach''.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
{{main|The Tree of Tongues}}
Tolkien envisioned many versions during the process of writing, even that Elves were taught speech by [[Oromë]]. In the [[Lhammas]], Tolkien provides this relationship.

*[[Valarin]]
**[[Aulëan]]
***[[Khuzdul]]
**[[Oromean]]
***Qenya
***[[Solosimpi]]n
****[[Ilkorin]]
***[[Old Noldorin]]/Kornoldorin
****[[Noldorin]] (influenced by Ilkorin)

==Other Elvish languages==
After Tolkien's time, others have invented Elvish languages in their own fiction. Some of them borrow elements from Tolkien, or simply retain similar structure and appearance.

*''[http://www.wowwiki.com/Darnassian Darnassian]'' and ''[http://www.wowwiki.com/Thalassian Thalassian]'', the languages of the Elves in the ''Warcraft'' universe.
* ''Common Elven'', the language of the surface Elves and ''Ssamath'' of the Dark Elves or Drow of Dungeons & Dragons settings
* ''[http://warhammeronline.wikia.com/wiki/Eltharin Eltharin]'', the language of the elves of Warhammer
** ''Fan-Eltharin'', the language of the Wood Elves
** ''Tar-Eltharin'', the language of the Sea Elves and High Elves
** ''Drukh-Eltharin'', the language of the Dark Elves
* Elvish language of Andrzej Sapkowski's ''Hexer'' saga, based on Welsh and English
* ''The [http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_language Ancient Language]'' of the elves in ''Eragon'', also spoken by the riders.
*[[Raymond E. Feist]] uses the words [[http://midkemia.wikia.com/wiki/Eldar Eldar], [http://midkemia.wikia.com/wiki/Caledhel Caledhel] and [http://midkemia.wikia.com/wiki/Moredhel Moredhel] for races of his Elves in Midkemia; the latter two are perfect Sindarin for "light elf" and "black elf" although as such, they haven't appeared in Tolkien's works ([[calben]] and [[morben]] are the actual Sindarin terms).

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was always fascinated with words and how languages worked, and by [[Wikipedia:Phonoesthetics|phonoesthetics]]. Tolkien had experimented with inventing languages during his youth long before creating his [[legendarium]].

Modelling [[Qenya]] on Finnish and [[Goldogrin]] on Welsh, Tolkien created several languages for the [[Elves]] to complement his books set in his fictional mythology. His interest was primarily philological, and he said his stories grew out of his languages. Indeed, the languages were the first thing Tolkien ever created for his mythos.
