'''Parth Galen''' was a green lawn above the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]] at the feet of [[Amon Hen]]. Parth Galen was on the western shore of [[Nen Hithoel]] near the southern end. It was a fair, green sward and its grass was watered by a small spring.<ref name="Breaking">{{FR|II10}}</ref>

==History==
On [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}}, the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] landed and camped at Parth Galen.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>  The next day saw the breaking of the Fellowship.  [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] asked for an hour to be alone to decide what to do and left Parth Galen to wander in the woods.  [[Boromir]] slipped away, following Frodo to persuade him to go to [[Minas Tirith]] and then attempted to seize [[the One Ring|the Ring]].  The others did not notice Boromir's absence until it was too late; when Boromir returned to Parth Galen and admitted that he had seen Frodo vanish a sense of panic fell upon the company.  [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] ran off to find him, followed by [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]].  [[Aragorn]] ordered Boromir to follow and guard Merry and Pippin while Aragorn pursued Sam.<ref name="Breaking"/>

Aragorn overtook Sam and told him to follow, but the Ranger soon outdistanced the small hobbit.  Sam stopped to think and realized that Frodo had decided to head East by himself.  Figuring that Frodo would need gear Sam correctly reckoned that Frodo would return to Parth Galen for supplies.  Sam raced to the lawn and saw a boat launching itself.  Charging into the water, Sam had to be saved by Frodo who drew him into his boat.  Frodo then agreed that Sam could come with him and allowed his servant to retrieve his own gear.  They then left Parth Galen to head for [[Emyn Muil]].<ref name="Breaking"/> 

In the meantime, Merry and Pippin were captured by a group of [[Uruk-hai]] and orcs, after Boromir had died defending them.  [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] brought Boromir's body to Parth Galen where they placed it in a boat with the [[Great Horn|Horn of Gondor]], his sword and the weapons of his slain enemies.  They then set the boat adrift on the lake of Nen Hithoel and it vanished over the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]].  The three companions then left Parth Galen in pursuit of Merry and Pippin.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>
