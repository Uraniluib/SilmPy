'''Hyarrostar''' was the wide promontory that spread out to the south and east of [[Númenor]], and in fact contained its easternmost point.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> Along its southern shores were wide beaches of white sands, and on its western borders, where the shorelands were interrupted by the mouths of the River [[Siril]], stood the township of [[Nindamos]]. The Hyarrostar was most famous for its trees, and it held great plantations that provided much of the wood used by Númenor's shipwrights.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
