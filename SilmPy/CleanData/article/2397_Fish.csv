'''Fish''' were common throughout the bodies of water in [[Arda]]. 

==History==
Fish formed the chief source of food in [[Númenor]], as it was abundant throughout the coast of the island. The fisherfolk dwelt mainly in [[Nindamos]], built on the hards of a marshy land. [[Guild of Venturers|Mariners]] of Númenor were mostly drawn from the fisher folk.<ref name="Descr">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>  

When the [[Númenóreans]] travelled to [[Middle-earth]], they encountered the [[Pre-Númenóreans|primitive tribes]] there. Though some of them, along the mouths of [[Morthond]] and [[Gwathló]], had crude fisheries, they had fallen out of use as its people fled towards the mountains.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref> The [[Stoors]] that dwelt in the [[Vales of Anduin]] also had fish as their main food. Two of them, [[Déagol]] and [[Sméagol]], were fishing when they found [[the One Ring]], lost in the river [[Anduin]].<ref name="Shadow">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

The [[Gondorians]], much like their forefathers, ate fish. The [[Ethir Anduin|Ethir]] was populated by fisher-folk, who often went out to [[Belegaer|sea]] on boats,<ref name='MT">{{RK|MT}}</ref> because fishing was the most profitable business.<ref>{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>

Though [[Hobbits]] did not generally hunt or fish for leasure,<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> they did angle for food now and then. One of the favourite spots for anglers was near ''[[The Golden Perch]]'', which took its name for the golden fish that swam there.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]; [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds.), "[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]", in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, p. 771</ref>

==Etymology==

The [[Quenya]] name for "fish" is ''[[lingwe]]'' (Quenya also has a word for "(small) fish", ''[[hala]]''). The [[Noldorin]] name, derived from the same [[Sundocarme|root]] is ''[[lhimb]]'' or ''lhim'', and [[Doriathrin]] has ''[[líw]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} (roots [[KHAL|KHAL<sup>1</sup>-]] and [[LIW|LIW-]])</ref>

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, "fish" is ''ing'', and "young of fish, small fry" is ''igli''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 51</ref> A [[Qenya]] name for "little fish" (also "[[Wikipedia:Minnow|minnow]]") is given as ''nis''.<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 20</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gollum throws a fish called "Xiphiidae" at [[Aragorn]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]], "[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)#River Anduin|River Anduin-Amon Hen]]"</ref> It becomes Aragorn's most dangerous weapon. Xiphiidae are swordfish. Swordfish are saltwater fish, but that matter is overlooked here.

:As of the thirteenth book, ''[[Doom of the Last-King]]'', fishing became a "hobby", a pastime for players.<ref>"[http://www.lotro.com/component/content/article/190-book-13-doom-of-the-last-king-all-in-mail-never-clinking-fishing-in-lotro Book 13: Doom of the Last-king – All in Mail, Never Clinking – Fishing in LOTRO]", [http://www.lotro.com/trial/index.php Lotro.com], dated [[15 April|April 15]], [[2008]] (accessed 31 August 2010)</ref>
