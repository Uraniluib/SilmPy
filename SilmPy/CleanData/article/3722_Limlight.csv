The '''Limlight''' was a river that ran through northern [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] and emptied into the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

It formed the southern boundary of the [[Field of Celebrant]], and was claimed by [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] of [[Lothlórien]] as the southern boundary of their realm.<ref>{{UT|6c}}</ref> It was also the historic northern border of [[Gondor]],<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) ''Cirion and Eorl''</ref> and later of [[Rohan]].<ref name="River">{{FR|II9}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2510}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the Northern Army of [[Gondor]] had been driven by the [[Balchoth]] and [[Orcs]] across the Limlight. The men of Gondor were facing destruction when [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]], leading the [[Éothéod]], fell upon the rear of the enemy and drove them southward with heavy losses over the Limlight into [[the Wold]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (ii) ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>

[[Aragorn]], at the behest of [[Gandalf]], hunted and captured [[Gollum]] in {{TA|3017|n}};<ref name="TA"/> on his journey north to [[Thranduil]] they crossed the Limlight since Aragorn was taking a route west of the Great River.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

In [[February]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] floated past the mouth of the Limlight as they headed south upon the Anduin.<ref name="River"/>

==Etymology==
The first element of the name is from an alien ([[Elvish]] or [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean]] form) which was obscure in [[Westron]]. The second element refers to the clarity of its bright waters.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 773</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] provided different explanations of the exact meaning and even languages used in the name, including ''Limlich'', ''Limliht'', ''Limlaith''<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 46</ref> and ''Limhîr''.<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, p. 337</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Limlight River is located in the region referred to as The Great River. The river runs from east to west and contributes to [[Anduin]]. There are Rohirrim located north of the river, but most of them are petty criminals who were expelled from the lands of [[Rohan]].
