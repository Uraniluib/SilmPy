'''Breredon''' (Briar Hill) was a little village in [[Buckland]] near [[Haysend]] on rising ground behind the hythe, or small landing, on the north bank of the [[Withywindle]] in the narrow tongue between the south end of the [[High Hay]] and the [[Baranduin]] River.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that ''Breredon'' is consisting of the elements ''brere'' ("[[wikipedia:Brier|briar]]") + ''-don'' ("down, hill").<ref>[[Andreas Möhn]], "[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bombadil_in_the_Shire.html Bombadil in the Shire]" at [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/M-earth.html Middle-earth Science Pages] (accessed 16 March 2011)</ref>

This etymology would represent a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Braerdun'' "hill of briers".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
