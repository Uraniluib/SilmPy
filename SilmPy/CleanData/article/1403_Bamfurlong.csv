[[File:Tim Kirk - Maggot's Farm.jpg|right|thumb|"Maggot's Farm" by [[Tim Kirk]]]]'''Bamfurlong''' was a farm in the boggy region of the [[Marish]] in the eastern [[The Shire|Shire]]. It was the home of [[Farmer Maggot]],<ref>{{AB|Boating}}</ref> who (like the other [[Hobbits]] in this inhospitable area) lived above ground rather than in a traditional [[Hobbit-holes|Hobbit-hole]]. [[Farmer Maggot|Maggot]]'s farm was well-known in the area for his mushrooms, which he protected fiercely against trespassers with his three fearsome [[Dogs|dogs]].

The center of the farm consisted of a large farm house with associated farm-buildings.  They were all made of brick with thatched roofs, and enclosed within a high wall with a wooden gate to the outside lane.

When [[Frodo Baggins]] was young and lived at [[Brandy Hall]] he occasionally sneaked onto the farm to poach some mushrooms.  On the last visit Maggot had caught Frodo and gave him a beating for his thievery.  Years later Frodo remained in terror of the farmer and his dogs.

On [[25 September]] {{TA|3018}}, Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] came to Bamfurlong in the afternoon. There they met Farmer Maggot and learned that earlier a [[Nazg√ªl|Black Rider]] had visited the farm and enquired about ''Baggins''.  The traveling hobbits gratefully accepted a hearty supper before the farmer drove them to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon.<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Bamfurlong'' represents [[Old English]] ''Beanfurlang'' "a [[Wikipedia:furlong|furlong]] of beans" or simply "bean-field"<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref> A ''[[Wiktionary:furlong|furlong]]'' means "forrow-length" and is a division of a common field.

''[[Wikipedia:Bamfurlong|Bamfurlong]]'' is a real-life English place-name.

<!--It would be nice to find evidence whether real-life Bamfurlong has the same "bean-field" etymology, or if it was Tolkien's suggestion-->
