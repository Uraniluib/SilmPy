==From the editor==

{{blockquote|The October 2014 issue of the Journal of Inklings Studies will be a special issue on the Inklings and the Bible.
It will include articles on C.S. Lewis’s “Liar, Lord or Lunatic” paradox, Lewis’s use of the Bible in his RAF talks, Lewis and Jerome, and J.R.R. Tolkien’s philosophy of creation. It will also include original texts by two Inklings: Charles Williams’s review of the Bible in Basic English, and J.R.R. Tolkien’s original translation of the Book of Jonah for the Jerusalem Bible.
Tolkien’s translation of Jonah as it appears in the Jerusalem Bible is a collaborative effort, drafted by Tolkien but edited by a style editor employed to standardize the grammar and vocabulary of the various translators contributing to the Jerusalem Bible. With kind permission, we are able to make available Tolkien’s original translation from Bodleian Manuscript. A research article by Brendan Wolfe on the history and features of the translation will accompany the text.<ref>[http://judithwolfe.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/tolkiens-jonah-text/ Judith Wolfe Blog]</ref>}}
