'''''The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest''''' is a third-person, action adventure video game in which the player fights through [[Middle-earth]] as [[Aragorn]]. The game was developed for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 by [[TT Fusion]], and for the Wii by [[Headstrong Games]]. It was released on [[14 September|14]] [[September]], [[2010]].

''Aragorn's Quest'' is the first officially-licensed game to be released by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]], who took over the license from [[Electronic Arts]] to publish ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''-related games. 


==Plot==
Set in the early [[Fourth Age]], 15 years after the destruction of [[the One Ring]] and downfall of [[Sauron]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] waits for the return of [[Aragorn]] to [[The Shire]] for a great party. As the [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]], Sam is in charge of arranging the festivities for King Elessar's arrival; in the mean-time, he regales his children with tales of Aragorn's exploits. (Cf. [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] meeting [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] at [[Brandywine Bridge]] in {{FoA|15}}.)
[[File:Aragorn's Quest - Sam and Frodo Gardner.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]] in [[The Shire]]|left]]
Sam's son, [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo Gamgee]], runs around [[Hobbiton]] completing tasks, whilst also re-living the Aragorn's adventures (as retold, not always perfectly accurately) by Sam.

==Gameplay==
The player controls [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo Gamgee]] in the hub world of [[the Shire]], where he can talk to people and perform simple tasks. When sitting down with his father, the player can control Aragorn in a fairy tale-like setting. Wii players can also control [[Gandalf]] as a second character.

Aragorn will wield a sword, a shield, a bow and spears, and can mount a horse.

===Controls===
The controls on the Wii have been compared with those of Nintendo's [[wikipedia:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]],<ref name="Kotaku Review"/><ref name="1UP Review"/> with the analogue-stick being using to control the on-screen character, with swiping of the Wii Remote up, down or to the side makes Aragorn perform similar on-screen actions; the D-pad switches weapon (to bow-and-arrow and flaming torch, for example), and the Z-button locks on, and C looks around. The controls for the PlayStation 3 - which only works with [[wikipedia:PlayStation Move|PlayStation Move]] - is much the same as those for the Wii.

The Nintendo DS version of the game uses rudimentary touch-screen controls (such as tracing a rune in order to open doors).<ref name="IGN Review" /> 

===Multiplayer===
[[File:Aragorn's Quest - Orcs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] fighting [[orcs]]]]At any point (on the Wii and PlayStation 3), a second player can drop into the game as [[Gandalf]], and work co-operatively in order to complete the tasks. Gandalf wields his staff and can utilise powerful magic to defeat enemies, such as hitting enemies with lightning and shooting firebolts, as well as the ability to heal, and use his sword; Gandalf's magic is recharged with orbs from dead enemies. 

When in [[The Shire]], a second player can also play as [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]] (dressed as Gandalf) to help Frodo Gamgee complete the mini-quests in Hobbiton; the second player has the same magical abilities as Gandalf in the Aragorn quests.

Archive sounds from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] were used for many of the main characters. It is unclear whether [[Chris Edgerly]] provided additional lines for Aragorn as he did in previous games. But Crispin Freeman did replace Orlando Bloom as Legolas

[[File:Aragorn's Quest - Troll3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Aragorn]] fighting a [[troll|troll]]]]In [[May]] [[2009]], it was announced that [[Warner Bros.

}}''The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest'' has received generally mixed reviews, with reviewers praising the sound quality and accessibility, but ultimately believing that the easiness of the game and the visuals hold it back from achieving the sort of sword-fighting ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' game that many would like to see. There is a general feeling amongst reviewers that ''Aragorn's Quest'' was an opportunity missed to make a truly great ''The Lord of the Rings'' action adventure hack and slash game.

[http://www.1up.com 1UP] compared the controls of ''Aragorn's Quest'' to [[wikipedia:Nintendo|Nintendo]]'s [[wikipedia:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]], praising the varied gameplay and the game's accessibility, but complaining that the game's side-quests were too repetitive, the [[wikipedia:Wii|Wii]] controls were too simplistic and "''a bit iffy''", with the experience of the two-player co-op mode being ruined by lag.<ref name="1UP Review">[http://www.1up.com 1UP], "[http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3181508 The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Review (Wii)]", [[21 September|21]] September 2010 (accessed [[27 September|27]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref> Similarly, [http://www.gametrailers.com GameTrailers] said "''The bottom line is that combat is not fun, and enemies are typically a cakewalk.''" and that the Wii controls were a nuisance, as was the lack of camera control; they also thought that the voice acting was "''awkward''" (although the soundtrack "''fits right in''") and that the game looks "''drab''".<ref name="GameTrailers Review">[http://www.gametrailers.com GameTrailers], "[http://www.gametrailers.com/gamereview.php?id=11382 The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Review], ''unknown date'' (accessed [[27 September|27]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref>

{{blockquote|the greatest strength of Aragorn's Quest comes not from its diverting but unspectacular combat, but the way it so accurately captures the atmosphere of the locations in the films and the resulting pleasure that comes from adventuring in these memorable Middle-earth locales.|[http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/adventure/lordoftheringsaragornsquest/review.html GameSpot Review]}}

[[File:Aragorn's Quest - Edoras.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An array of characters]]However, [http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot], in a more positive review, said, "''The environments impress with their variety, attention to detail, and the way they so faithfully reflect the visual style of the films.''" but that ''Aragorn's Quest'' lacks challenge, with the Wii controls being "''imprecise''"; they wish that more attention-to-detail had been paid to enemies.<ref name="GameSpot Review">[http://www.gamespot.com GameSpot], "[http://uk.gamespot.com/wii/adventure/lordoftheringsaragornsquest/review.html The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Review]", [[17 September|17]] September 2010 (accessed [[27 September|27]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref> [http://www.ign.com IGN] thought the Wii version was far superior to the PlayStation 3 version of the game, but still suggested this was a game for just [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] aficionados as only they would be able to overlook the game's flaws; IGN also complained about the mixed visual style, but loved reliving moments from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|the films]].<ref name="IGN Review">[http://www.ign.com IGN] "[http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/112/1122359p1.html The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest Review]", [[20 September|20]] September 2010 (accessed [[27 September|27]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref>

[http://reviews.cnet.com CNET] describes the storytelling as "''charming''"; they also found the motion-controls on the Wii "''frustrating''" but felt it didn't matter because defeating the "''very easy''" enemies was still "''satisfying''". CNET also said the ending of the game was an "''anti-climax''", but praised the environments: "''The environments impress with their variety, attention to detail, and the way they so faithfully reflect the visual style of the films.''<ref name="CNET Review">[http://reviews.cnet.com CNET], "[http://reviews.cnet.com/wii-games/the-lord-of-the/4505-9993_7-33667269.html#reviewPage1 The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest (Wii) - GameSpot editors' review]", [[16 September|16]] September 2010 (accessed [[29 September|29]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref> Finally, [http://www.kotaku.com Kotaku] loved the game's film-based adventure, "''attractive''" visuals, variety of characters and film-based soundtrack, but absolutely hated the easiness of the game, claiming that one person could play the two-player co-op mode.<ref name="Kotaku Review">[http://www.kotaku.com Kotaku], "[http://kotaku.com/5642722/the-lord-of-the-rings-aragorns-quest-review-saurons-a-chump The Lord of The Rings: Aragorn's Quest Review: Sauron's A Chump]", [[20 September|20]] September 2010 (accessed [[27 September|27]] [[September]] [[2010]])</ref>

'''In Short:''' reviewers enjoyed the graphical style and musical score, faithfully recreating the feel and atmosphere of the films (although some thought the mixed style was confused, and some thought the attention-to-detail was inconsistent), but felt that the Wii controls were frustratingly inaccurate and that enemies were far too easy. Though aimed primarily at families and younger gamers, reviewers were keen to point out that anyone could enjoy it, but it would appeal primarily film-fans who would be able to over-look the game's faults.
