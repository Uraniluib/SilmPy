The '''Guest-elves''' were a branch of the [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]].
==History==
When [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]], leader of the [[Green-elves]], was killed by [[Orcs]] on [[Amon Ereb]] in the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], some of the [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] fled westward to [[Doriath]] and settled in [[Arthórien]]. These became known as the Guest-elves.<ref name=WJP1>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 112-3</ref>

The Guest-elves had their own chief (of whom [[Saeros]] was the son), and they had a permanent place in the council of [[Thingol]]. However, some of the Guest-elves were "darkhearted", and they did not "mingle happily with the Teleri of Doriath".<ref name=WJP1/> Neither were they friends to the [[Edain]] of [[Estolad]]—the [[Men|mannish]] region situated just east of Arthórien, into which the Guest-elves often wandered by crossing the River [[Celon]].<ref name=UT>{{UT|2d}}</ref>
