'''High King of the Noldor''' was the title of the head of the [[House of Finwë]] in [[Beleriand]] and [[Middle-earth]]. It was held by Elf-lords of the [[Noldor]] who held rulership over all the Noldorin realms. The overlordship was mostly titular; the [[Sons of Fëanor]], in particular, while they acknowledged the Kingship, paid its bearer little heed; they preferred to follow their own policies under the general leadership of [[Maedhros]].

The forefather of the House of Finwë was [[Finwë]], the first lord of the [[Tatyar]] who led his people in the [[Great Journey]] from [[Cuiviénen]] into [[Aman|the West]] to dwell in [[Valinor]]. He was slain by [[Morgoth]] at [[Formenos]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> His eldest son [[Fëanor]] led the host of the Noldor back to Middle-earth to avenge his father's death and recover the [[Silmarils]] from Morgoth. He was slain in his assault on [[Angband]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> After his death, the Kingship by right belonged to his eldest son Maedhros, but he refused it and the succession passed instead to [[Fëanor]]'s half-brother, Fingolfin.

# '''[[Fingolfin]]''' (ruled 454 years to [[First Age 455]])<br>He dwelt to the northwest of [[Beleriand]] with his sons, and ruled the Noldor during the [[Siege of Angband]]. When Morgoth broke the leaguer in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], he rode in anger to the gates of Angband and died in single combat with Morgoth. He was succeeded by his eldest son.
# '''[[Fingon]]''' (ruled 16 years to [[First Age 472]])<br>His short reign was one of endless war with the forces of Morgoth. With Maedhros, he prepared a final assault on Morgoth, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], which ended in disaster for the Noldor and Fingon's own death. He was succeeded by his brother.
# '''[[Turgon]]''' (ruled 39 years to [[First Age 510]])<br>Turgon's kingship was titular indeed, as it was not possible for him to rule from his [[Gondolin|Hidden City]], the location of which was unknown by even his own kin. That was until Gondolin's location was discovered by Morgoth through the treachery of Maeglin, and Turgon died in its Fall. After his death, the Kingship passed to the [[Finarfin]] line, with the son of [[Orodreth]].
# '''[[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]''' (ruled 3,514 years to [[Second Age 3441]])<br>The last High King, Gil-galad held the Kingship longer than any of his forebears ruling through the [[Second Age]]. He was the chief enemy of [[Sauron]] in the [[Dark Years]], at the end of which he formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with [[Elendil]], and died during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] at the end of the Second Age. 

Gil-galad was the last High King; after his time the title is never used, as obviously no heirs of the [[House of Fëanor]] or [[House of Fingolfin]] remained in [[Middle-earth]]. [[Galadriel]] of the
[[House of Finarfin]] perhaps could have some rights.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "High King of the Noldor"</ref> [[Elrond]] was a direct descendant of Turgon, but through his daughter [[Idril]]; he never made claim to the Kingship but ruled with all its authority.
