The '''Dominion of [[Men]]''' refers to the fact that Men remained the only speaking race on [[Arda|the world]], inheriting its mastery from the ancient [[Elves]]. For this they were sometimes called "The Usurpers" by the Elves.<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> The Dominion specifically referred to the advent of the [[Fourth Age]] and beyond.

This began in the late [[Third Age]], the "Fading Years" for the Elves, when most left [[Middle-earth]] and sailed to [[Aman|the West]]. This was the case for example, of the Elvish realm of [[Dol Amroth]], which was abandoned by the Elves before becoming a realm of [[Dúnedain]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Meanwhile, other races, such as [[Dwarves]]<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> and [[Ents]],<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> saw their numbers dwindling.  The Dominion of Men was exemplified in the extent of the [[Mannish]] language of [[Westron]], which by the end of the Age was adopted by most of the other speaking races of the [[Westlands]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref><ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> 

By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the Dominion of Men was already projected. [[Saruman]] saw it as an opportunity and prepared [[Sauron]]'s rule for the [[Younger Days]]. He attempted to invite Gandalf to join this Power.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

[[Gandalf]] spoke of the Dominion of Men when he and Aragorn stood in the high hallow on [[Mindolluin]], where there grew a sapling of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> [[Aragorn]]'s ascent to the Throne of [[Gondor]] and the [[Reunited Kingdom]] marked that new era.

The Dominion of Men officially began with the destruction of [[the One Ring]], when the [[Three Rings]] lost their powers of preserving the lore and beauty as understood by the [[Eldar]] and their [[Keepers of the Three Rings|Keepers]] passed over the [[Belegaer|Sea]] on the [[White Ship]].
