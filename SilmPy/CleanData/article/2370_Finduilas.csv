'''Finduilas''' was a [[Noldor|Noldorin]] princess of the [[First Age]], the daughter of [[Orodreth]], ruler of [[Nargothrond]], and a sister of [[Gil-galad]].

== History ==
Finduilas lived in Nargothrond with her father and brother under the rule of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. She was betrothed to [[Gwindor]], who named her '''[[Faelivrin]]''', which meant "Gleam of the Sun on the [[Pools of Ivrin]]".<ref name="CH10">{{CH|10}}</ref>

Her betrothed was captured in {{FA|472}} during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] by [[Morgoth]],<ref>{{GA|227}}</ref> but he returned in {{FA|490|n}} with a companion<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> who called himself ''[[Agarwaen]], son of [[Umarth]]'' ("Bloodstained, son of the Cursed"). Unknown to Finduilas this was actually [[Túrin]] son of [[Húrin]].

Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, who was now mutilated, Finduilas fell in love with noble Túrin who became an influential warrior of Nargothrond.  Túrin failed to notice her feelings, she reminding him of [[Lalaith]], the sister he lost in childhood. Gwindor realized that Finduilas had fallen in love with Túrin, and revealed his name to her in an attempt to discourage her pursuit.<ref name="CH10"/>

At the [[Sack of Nargothrond]] by [[Glaurung]], Finduilas was captured. Gwindor was slain after ordering Túrin to protect Finduilas as only she could save him from his fate; however he was entranced by the dragon, and he could not hear Finduilas' cries as she was being dragged past him by the [[Orcs]] as a captive for [[Angband]].<ref>{{CH|11}}</ref> 

Due to Glaurung's deceit Túrin abandoned Finduilas and instead went to [[Hithlum]] in search for his kin. When the Orcs were waylaid by the [[Haladin]] of [[Brethil]] at the [[Crossings of Teiglin]] they killed all their captives, pinning Finduilas to a tree with a spear. 

By the time Túrin  regained his senses, the Haladin buried her in a mound they called ''[[Haudh-en-Elleth]]'' ("Mound of the Elf-maiden").<ref>{{CH|13}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Finduilas.mp3|Ardamir}}
[[Robert Foster]] suggested that Finduilas's name contains the element ''find-'' for "hair".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}</ref>
