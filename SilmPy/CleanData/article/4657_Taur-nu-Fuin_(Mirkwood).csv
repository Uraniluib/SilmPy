{{disambig-two|Mirkwood|forest in [[Dorthonion]]|[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)]]}}
At the beginning of the second millennium of the [[Third Age]], a mysterious being came to [[Amon Lanc]] in the south of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]], and there built the stronghold known as [[Dol Guldur]]. This was the magician known as the [[Necromancer]], who was later revealed to be none other than [[Sauron]] himself, and from his fortress tower a shadow of nightshade began to spread across the woodlands. From that time on, the [[Elves]] came to refer to the Greenwood as '''[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Mirkwood)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]''', the forest under nightshade, rendered into the [[Mannish]] tongue as '[[Mirkwood]]'. 

The story of Sauron's darkening of Greenwood the Great mirrors events in the [[First Age]], when he occupied the highland forests of [[Dorthonion]], north of [[Beleriand]]. That region, too, fell under his shadow, and was also known as [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]].
