'''Dor-en-Ernil''' was a coastland region of southern [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Its name is [[Sindarin]] for "Land of the Prince", a reference to the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]]. 
==Geography==
Though its boundaries are not clearly established, it appears to have been part of - or perhaps synonymous with - the mountainous coastland fief known as [[Belfalas]]. Extending out from its western shores was smaller peninsula on which was built [[Dol Amroth]], the seat of the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]] in the later [[Third Age]].

==History==
In the late [[First Age]], [[Sindar]] refugees from [[Beleriand]]<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 247</ref> settled the area and established an Elven settlement about 50 miles north of the later-named [[Dol Amroth]], at [[Edhellond]]<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, note 18, p. 255</ref> 

A family of [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the [[Second Age]]. This family of [[Númenóreans]] were akin to the [[Lords of Andúnië]], and thus related to [[Elendil]] and descended from the [[House of Elros]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they had been given the title ''Prince of Belfalas'' by [[Elendil]]<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> and their land, now a fief of [[Gondor]], was called Dor-en-Ernil. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas.

Amroth, [[King of Lórien]] from the beginning of the Third Age,<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 243-44.</ref> left his [[Lorien|realm]] behind in {{TA|1981}} in search of his beloved [[Nimrodel]], who had fled from the [[Balrog|horror]] unleashed by the [[Dwarves]] in [[Moria]], along with numerous [[Galadhrim]].  He waited for her at Edhellond, for their final voyage together into the West. But Nimrodel, who loved [[Middle-earth]] as much as she did Amroth, failed to join him.  When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her, and drowned in the bay.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 240-242, 245.</ref> When [[Amroth]] was lost at sea in {{TA|1981}} the last of these Elves left the region.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

It was from the name of this king that Dol Amroth (the "Hill of Amroth") took its name. The first Prince of Dol Amroth was [[Galador]], the son of [[Imrazôr]]. According to legend, Imrazôr had married the Elven-lady [[Mithrellas]], a companion of Nimrodel.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39, p. 316</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], the nearby city of [[Linhir]] was attacked by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and the [[Haradrim]] and Men of [[Lamedon]] under [[Angbor]] tried to keep them off, until the [[Grey Company]] with the [[wraiths]] of the [[Oathbreakers]] arrived and ended the conflict.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Dor-en-Ernil'' consists of the [[Sindarin]] words ''[[dor]]'' "land" + ''[[en]]'' "of" + ''[[ernil]]'' "prince".<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 12</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that the name appears only in the [[Map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor]], the label being on the east of an unnamed hillrange.<ref name=amroth14>{{UT|Amroth}}, note 14</ref> The name doesn't appear in the [[general Map of Middle-earth]]. For the newer map for the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', C. Tolkien put the label on the same location, but among the wider context.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

C. Tolkien notes that while, in the original map, the label was put between the hilrange and Gilrain to the east, the name betrayed a connection to the Princes<ref name=amroth14>{{UT|Amroth}}, note 14</ref> and thus the name would refer to the wider area that included Dol Amroth, farther to the west.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dor-en-Ernil was an area in the region of Central Gondor, located south of the [[Ringló Vale]] and west of Lower [[Lebennin]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], it was attacked by [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and [[Haradrim]]. The fishing village of "Gaerlond" and the inland village of "Tungobel" were both burned, the lighthouse of "Barad Rill" was toppled, and the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] "Dol Brannor" was seized by the Enemy. The river [[Gilrain]] and the city of [[Linhir]] formed the eastern border. The hills to the west, between Dor-en-Ernil and the Havens of [[Belfalas]] were mostly inaccessible but were identified in dialogue as the "Emyn Ernil".
