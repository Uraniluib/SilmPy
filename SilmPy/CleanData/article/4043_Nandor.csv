The '''Nandor''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈnandor]}}; sg. ''Nando''), who included the ''[[Silvan Elves]]'' (or "Wood-elves") and ''[[Green-elves]]'', were one of the [[Teleri]]n races of [[Elves]].  Like the [[Sindar]], they were [[Úmanyar]] i.e. part of the [[Teleri]] who began the [[Great Journey]] but did not complete it. The Nandor were the original elven inhabitants of [[Middle-earth]] east of [[Beleriand]], but eventually they also stretched out across the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]] as well into [[Ossiriand]]. Many journeyed down the River Anduin forming Kingdoms of the [[Silvan Elves]]: the [[Woodland Realm]] and [[Lothlórien]]. The [[Galadhrim|people of Lórien]] were of this kind, as were the [[Wood-elves of Mirkwood]].

==History==

===Lenwë and Denethor===
<!--"Laiquendi" in Eriador#Earlier History links here-->
The Nandor were originally simply a group of the Teleri indistinct from the others who were afraid to cross the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], and content to remain in the wide forested lands to the east, along the river [[Anduin]].  One of the Teleri, of the silver-haired kindred of [[Olwë]] that would later become the [[Falmari]], rose to lead them.  He was named [[Lenwë]], and led a great number of the Teleri south along the Great River, where they fell out of the histories for a long time.  They called themselves the Nandor, and they loved water and green things.  Under Lenwë they developed great knowledge and skill with herbs and living things, tree and beast alike.  Their culture became very distinct.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

Gradually, the Nandor spread out.  They may have moved on to live in [[Eriador]], or by the mouth of the Sea at the outpouring of Anduin.  They were a simple folk, with no weapons of steel.  They made friends, too, with the [[Naugrim]], and were contented.  But evil beasts came from the north, and they had no defense against such terrible weapons.  They had been told by the Naugrim about King [[Thingol]] and the might of the [[Sindar]], therefore [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]], Lenwë's son, crossed over the [[Ered Luin]] into [[Beleriand]], the western lands of Middle-earth.  There they settled in the green and many-rivered [[Ossiriand]], welcomed by Thingol as long-lost relatives.  They were called the [[Laiquendi|Laegrim]].<ref name=sindar>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

===Wars of Beleriand===

Thingol took advantage of their friendship on the first opportunity, when he was in great need.  The Dark Lord [[Morgoth|Belegurth]] [[First Battle of Beleriand|invaded]] Beleriand, cutting Thingol off from his other strong allies, the [[Falathrim]].  But Ossiriand was wide and Morgoth could not sever that connection.  Thingol called Denethor to his aid, and the Laegrim came.  Thingol attacked the orc-host from the west, and the Laegrim from the east, creating a hammer-and-anvil technique that succeeded.  But this victory came at great cost.  The Laegrim were lightly-armed, and the orcs shod in iron.  Denethor was cut off at [[Amon Ereb]]; he and all those nearest about him were killed before Thingol could rescue him.  The Laegrim loved him and mourned his loss, and henceforth would take no king.  They became reclusive, pulling away from the many troubles of Beleriand, and fighting no longer against Belegurth.<ref name=sindar />

When the [[Noldor]] returned from over the [[Belegaer|Sea]], they gave the Laegrim the name (in [[Quenya]]) ''[[Laiquendi]]''.  The Laiquendi did not participate in the great events of Beleriand throughout the First Age.  The Laiquendi accepted [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], who came to [[Tol Galen]] in the midst of their lands, and made it one of the most beautiful places in Beleriand.  After the dreadful sack of Doriath and death of Thingol, many of the Laiquendi joined Beren in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]].  The Green-elves later sent the news to King [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] of the final deaths of Beren and Lúthien.<ref name="ref3">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the [[Sons of Fëanor]] wandered in the lands of the Laiquendi, bereft of lands, often mixing with them.<ref name="ref4">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===Second Age===
(''Henceforth see also [[Galadhrim]] and [[Elves of Mirkwood]]'')

After the [[War of Wrath]], Ossiriand survived no longer, and the survivors of the Laiquendi once more merged back into the main Nandorin population, who now were spread over the face of Middle-earth.  The Nandor on both sides of the mountain range were of a somewhat less pure strain, those in Ossiriand having mixed blood with some [[Sindar]], and those in the east having mixed blood with the [[Avari]] who came westwards.  As the Second Age went on, the blood became even more mixed.  Even their language changed from [[Nandorin]] to [[Sindarin]].  Gradually, the Nandor were changing into what became known as ''Silvan Elves'' or ''Tawarwaith'', meaning "Forest People"<ref name="ref5">{{UT|Galadriel}}, Appendices A & B</ref>.

The Nandor, now known in their impure state as Tawarwaith, were soon pushed into refuge when [[Sauron]] rose to challenge elven power in Middle-earth.  Some were forced to take refuge with the [[Noldor]], who although weakened were still very powerful, in [[Lindon]] and [[Rivendell|Imladris]].  Others dwelt with [[Círdan]] the Sinda in [[Mithlond]], and still others hid in their ancient forest homes [[Lórinand]] and [[Mirkwood|Eryn Galen]].  They took leaders from the pure-blood clans of Noldor and Sindar; in the case of the latter two refuges, the Sindarin lords [[Amdír]] and [[Oropher]] respectively.

The Tawarwaith of Lórinand (the ''[[Galadhrim]]'') and Eryn Galen played mostly a small role in the events of the [[Second Age]], as they had in the First.  Amdír and Oropher built up their kingdoms as the shadow of Sauron grew longer and longer, and evil more powerful.  Both Amdír and Oropher took great hosts to join the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and fought in the [[War of the Last Alliance|war that followed]].  Both hosts suffered immense losses; Amdír was cut off and killed in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] with many of his followers, while Oropher rashly disobeyed King [[Gil-galad]] in [[Mordor]] and fell beside two thirds of the entire company<ref name="ref5" />.  The Tawarwaith entered the [[Third Age]] greatly weakened and disheartened, despite the seemingly final defeat of Sauron.

===Third Age===

Lórinand, now known as [[Lothlórien]], and Eryn Galen, now known as [[Mirkwood]], continued to host the larger populations of Tawarwaith.  [[Amroth]] took over in Lothlórien, later passing the rulership on to [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]], while [[Thranduil]] became king in Mirkwood.  Under these rulers the Tawarwaith prospered and became numerous once more, while the Noldor and Sindar were in slow but steady decline.  Yet though mostly inactive, they were watchful of the growing of [[men]] and the ominous change the Third Age would bring<ref name="ref5" />.

But the elves of both Lothlórien and Mirkwood were threatened by a new evil growing in south Mirkwood.  The [[Necromancer]] was building [[Dol Guldur]].  As the Third Age continued and Sauron rose, the [[White Council]] was formed.  Sauron was driven from Dol Guldur several times, but the Tawarwaith were still for the most part impassive.  Eventually the [[War of the Ring]] came.  [[Legolas]], Thranduil’s son, became a hero of that war, while both Lothlórien and Mirkwood were invaded by Dol Guldur in the [[Rhovanion Campaign (WotR)|Rhovanion Campaign]].  All attacks were repulsed, and Dol Guldur was [[Fall of Dol Guldur|thrown down]] at last in a grand counterattack by Celeborn and his forces<ref name="ref6">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Appendix B]]''</ref>.  Mirkwood was renamed ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]''.  Yet the Silvan population was again diminished.  Galadriel and Celeborn passed west, and the light of Lórien faded.

Throughout the [[Fourth Age]] they aided the rising [[Reunited Kingdom]], making [[Ithilien]] green, for instance<ref name="ref7">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Appendix A]]''</ref>.  Their eventual fate was to pass west to the land they had never seen, or else to remain in Middle-earth Changed and fade into forgetfulness.
