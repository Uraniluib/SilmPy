'''Estolad''' was a green and fertile plain in [[East Beleriand]] east of the River [[Celon]] and south of the forest of [[Nan Elmoth]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[First Age]] the [[Noldor]] returned to [[Middle-earth]] and established realms in [[Beleriand]]. Estolad was part of the region ruled by Amrod and Amras, twins who were the youngest sons of [[Fëanor]]. It appears though that few [[Elves]] settled in this area and thus it was available for later settlers.

Over three centuries after the return of the Noldor, Men began migrating over the [[Ered Luin]] into the Elvish lands of [[Beleriand]]. It was [[Finrod]] who first came into contact with these newcomers in [[Ossiriand]] near the mountains and made friends with [[Bëor]] and his people. However, the [[Green-elves]] of the region did not want these strangers, hewers of trees and hunters of beasts, to settle in their domain. They asked Finrod to persuade the followers of Bëor and others yet to come to move on. Finrod did successfully persuade these people to remove to Estolad, which in [[Sindarin]] meant the "Encampment". Although Bëor left to be in the service of Finrod, Bëor's son [[Baran]] continued to rule his people in Estolad.

The people of the [[Haladin]] migrated into [[Thargelion]], but the people of [[Marach]] followed the people of Bëor to Estolad, where they dwelt south and east of the first arrivals. However, the [[Edain]] in Estolad desired to continue to move westward and the kings of the Noldor, seeing strong potential in Men as allies, invited them to come live in their realms. Within fifty years thousands of Men had departed from the region,<ref name="West"/> although many remained until East Beleriand was overrun during the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

The Haladin living in Thargelion were harassed by the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]]. When an Orc-raid was sent to fall upon these people one man, [[Haldad]], gathered fighting men into a stockade and resisted the Orcs. Haldad and his son [[Haldar]] were killed but their people were saved by the arrival of [[Caranthir]] and his host. The Elf lord offered land in his realm to [[Haleth]], the daughter of Haldad who had continued the resistance to the Orcs, but she refused Caranthir's offer. Instead she led her people to Estolad where they dwelt for a time. This though was temporary; eventually Haleth would move her people to the [[Forest of Brethil]].<ref name="West"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
On the second Map of Beleriand, on Sheet 2 North-east, in square F11, Estolad is written as "Estoland". As [[Christopher Tolkien]] noted, in all other occurrences the name is Estolad.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, pp. 183, 189</ref>
