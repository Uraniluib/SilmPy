'''Dimrost''', also known as '''Nen Girith''', was a cascading waterfall on the stream of [[Celebros]], where it flowed down to meet the River [[Taeglin]] on the borders of [[Brethil]].<ref>{{CH|A2M}}</ref> The falls raised a fine spray into the air, from which they took their name, which means "Rainy Stair".  Above Dimrost, the [[Men]] of [[Brethil]] had constructed a wooden bridge to cross the Celebros. 

From the bridge, a wide view could be seen, showing the [[Ravines of Taeglin]] two miles distant.<ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}, ''Nienor in Brethil''</ref>

==History==

When [[Nienor|NÃ­niel]] was first brought to Brethil, when she saw that view from the bridge, she started shivering uncontrollably - so much so that the name of Dimrost was changed to ''Nen Girith'', the "Shuddering Water".<ref name="Narn"/> It was only later that the cause of her fear was discovered: the Ravines she had seen from the bridge would be the place of her tragic death.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Nen Girith is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[dim]]'' "stair" and ''[[rost]]'' "rain".
