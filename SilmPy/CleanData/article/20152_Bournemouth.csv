Tolkien]] frequently visited for his holidays; staying in the same room at the [[Hotel Miramar]], with a second room to write in. In the late 1960s Tolkien retired to nearby [[Woodridings|Poole]] with his [[Edith Tolkien|wife]] to escape the [[Tolkien fandom|attention]] of [[Oxford]]. After his wife's death, Tolkien moved back to Oxford and lived at [[21 Merton Street]]. In late August [[1973]], he visited Bournemouth to see some friends; it was here that he died on [[2 September|September 2]], [[1973]]<ref>''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 354]] (dated [[29 August|August 29]], [[1973]]</ref>.
