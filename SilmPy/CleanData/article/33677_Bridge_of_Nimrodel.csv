The '''Bridge of Nimrodel''' once spanned the river [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]] near its meeting with the [[Celebrant]]. It was part of the path from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] into [[Lothlórien]]. By the time the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] came to the river on [[15 January]] {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>, the bridge had long broken down.<ref name="Lorien">{{FR|II6}}</ref> In the absence of a bridge, [[Legolas]] led the party down the deep-cloven bank to wade across the soothing waters.<ref name="Lorien"/>
