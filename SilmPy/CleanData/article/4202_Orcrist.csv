'''Orcrist''' was an Elven sword, the mate of [[Glamdring]]. It had a fancy scabbard and a jeweled hilt. Like [[Glamdring]] and [[Sting]], the blade could detect the presence of Orcs and warn its bearer by glowing blue.

Goblins called the blade '''Biter'''.<ref name=hill>{{H|Hill}}</ref> It had been crafted by the [[Elves]], who not only made it a valuable weapon, but also a feared one to their enemies, particularly among [[Orcs]] and other evil creatures.<ref name=rest>{{H|Rest}}</ref> 

==History==
As the "mate" to King [[Turgon]]'s sword Glamdring, Orcrist was likely borne by him, or a high ranking lord of the [[Gondolindrim]] in the King's entourage.  

Orcrist "had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls".<ref name=hill/> During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Rog]], [[Duilin of Gondolin|Duilin]], [[Egalmoth]], [[Tuor]] and [[Ecthelion]]'s houses defended at the gates before the walls. [[Ecthelion]] led a charge that resulted in the deaths of thousands of [[orcs]], which made his name a terror to their race, before fighting [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]].

By the [[Third Age]] Orcrist and its mate were found and kept in a [[Troll's Cave|trolls' cave]] in [[Eriador]]. [[Thorin and Company]], found and searched the cave early in the [[Quest of Erebor]], and [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] obtained the weapon.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> [[Elrond]] identified the sword and Thorin promised to honor the sword and hoped to cleave Goblins once again<ref name=rest/> which he did when captured in [[Goblin-town]].<ref name=hill/>

Thorin was disarmed when captured by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] and Orcrist was kept there.<ref>{{H|8}}</ref> However after his death, [[Thranduil]] returned Orcrist and placed it upon Thorin's tomb under [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and it "gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached".<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Orcrist'' is [[Sindarin]] for "goblin-cleaver".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 265</ref>

In the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', the name ''Orchrist'' is said to be a "sword-name", related to [[Noldorin]] ''risto'' ("rend, rip"), derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] RIS ("slash, rip").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 384</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:''' 
:As in the book, the sword is found in the trolls' cave and is identified as Orcrist by [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. The hilt of the sword is a dragon's tooth and the sword contains the [[Sindarin]] inscription "NAGOL E-LYG" meaning "Tooth of-Snake [or dragon]".<ref>[[Jude Fisher]], ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: Visual Companion]]'', p. 13</ref>

:When it is discovered by the Goblins, the [[Great Goblin]] recognizes the sword, and claimed that it sliced a thousand necks. Later, when Thorin and Company are captured by the Wood-elves, [[Legolas]] personally confiscates the sword, believing that Thorin Oakenshield had stolen it from his kinfolk. He then takes up the legendary weapon as his own, using it when [[Bolg]] and his stealth-Orcs raid Lake-town in search of the Dwarves, and during the Battle of the Five Armies, where he returns Orcrist to Thorin just in time for his final showdown with [[Azog| Azog the Defiler]].
