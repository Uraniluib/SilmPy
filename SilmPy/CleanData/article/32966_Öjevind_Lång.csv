''Húrins barn'', Lång's translation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' was published in September 2007 by Norstedts. It was generally received as a good translation among Swedish Tolkien fans, although not without faults: the most prominent mistake was perhaps the conceptual separation between ''Ered Lindon'' and ''Ered Luin''.<ref group="note">The Swedish translation has "''Blå bergen'' Den stora bergskedjan (uppdelad i ''Ered Luin'' och ''Ered Lindon'') mellan Beleriand och Eriador under äldre tiden." (p. 299). A direct English translation of Lang's sentence would be "''Blue Mountains'' The great mountain chain (divided into [sic] ''Ered Luin'' and ''Ered Lindon'') between Beleriand and Eriador in the Elder Days.", while the original has "''Blue Mountains'' The great mountain chain (called ''Ered Luin'' and ''Ered Lindon'') between Beleriand and Eriador in the Elder Days." (p. 298).</ref><ref>[http://tolkiensarda.se/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4036&sid=7bc70e1ddb8de7d49186738fb9960f69&start=15 Húrins barn översatt av Öjevind Lång] at [http://tolkiensarda.se/forum/index.php Tolkiens Arda] (accessed 26 April 2011)</ref>
