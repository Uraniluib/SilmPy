The '''Siege of Pelargir''' was the aftermath of the last battle of the [[Kin-strife]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
In {{TA|1447}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the rightful King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] slew [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]] at the [[Battle of the Crossings of Erui]].  Led by his sons, Castamir's kin and the people of the fleets retreated and held out for one year in the port city of [[Pelargir]].  The siege could not be broken because Eldacar had no ships, which allowed the rebels to resupply and gather all of the support that they could.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  In {{TA|1448|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the rebels sailed away to [[Umbar]] and established a lordship independent of Gondor.  This refuge of enemies lasted for generations, until finally subdued by King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] in the [[Fourth Age]].<ref name="Gondor"/>
