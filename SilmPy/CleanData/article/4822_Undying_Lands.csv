{{main|Aman}}

'''Undying Lands''' was a name for [[Aman]], or at least that part of it inhabited by the [[Valar]], [[Maiar]] and [[Elves]]. The island of [[Tol Eressëa]] is several times identified as the easternmost of the Undying Lands, and, at the least, [[Valinor]] must also be included.

"Undying Lands" seems to be a name that originated among [[Men]]. The [[Númenóreans]], especially, envied the seemingly endless life of those who lived in these regions. From the first, the Valar placed a ban on the Men of Númenor, that they should not sail into the West from their island, or set foot on the shores of Aman.

Wise as the Valar were, though, they did not foresee the wiles of [[Sauron]]. The fallen Maia falsely persuaded the last [[King of Númenor]], [[Ar-Pharazôn]], that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be undying himself. Believing Sauron, Ar-Pharazôn assembled a great navy and sailed westward to make hopeless war on the Valar for the imagined prize of endless life.

The Valar could not permit this: [[Manwë]] called upon [[Ilúvatar]], and the land of Númenor was destroyed and lost forever. The Undying Lands, which until that time had been part of the World, were removed forever from the reach of mortal Men, though the Elves could still sail West and come there, if they would.

It is to the Undying Lands that the White Ship sails at the end of [[The Lord of the Rings]]. The [[Ring-bearers]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] were among the very few mortal beings to set foot on the shores of the Undying Lands. Later [[Samwise Gamgee]], and then [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] together, ventured for the Undying Lands.
