'''Elanor''', or '''The Flemish Fantasy Society''' ([[wikipedia:Dutch|Dutch]]: ''Het Vlaams Fantasy Genootschap''), is a [[Tolkien Societies|Tolkien and Fantasy society]] based in [[wikipedia:Belgium|Belgium]]. ''Elanor'' was founded in [[1999]], at which point it was exclusive a [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-only society, in order to bring a group of committed Tolkien-enthusiasts together over a range of activities.<ref name="AH">Hedwig Valkiers, "Around the World in 80(?) Societies: Elanor" in [[Andrew Butler]] (ed.), ''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]'', vol. [[Amon Hen 222|222]], [[March]] [[2010]], p.26</ref> Elanor was founded after Flemish Tolkien enthusiasts felt a Tolkien Society independent from [[Unquendor]] would suit them better. Although both Flanders and the Netherlands share the same language, there are considerable cultural differences separating these territories.

==About==
{{quote|We have been able to bring together a tight group of people who have fantasy reading and Tolkien's work at heart. By providing a large variety of activites to everyone's taste, anyone can enthusiastically partake, tell stories, discuss and compare with stories by authors such as [[wikipedia:Robin Hobb|Robin Hobb]] and [[wikipedia:Terry Goodkind|Terry Goodkind]].<br/>Each activity has as its main purpose fun and talking free and easy about our common hobby and this principally at the [[Birthday Toast|Tolkien Birthday Toast]] on [[3 January|January 3]], the quiz at the end of [[February]], the [[Tolkien Reading Day]] in [[March]] and the games nights. The [[Inklings|Inkling]]-evenings on the other hand are meant to discuss Tolkien's literary works in earnest. [...] The member's day in [[September]] concludes our year's activities and there our Bards and the group "Namarië" perform each year a fragment from Tolkien's books adapted by ourselves.|Description in [[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]] [[Amon Hen 222|222]]}}
