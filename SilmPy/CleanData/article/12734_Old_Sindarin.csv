'''Old Sindarin''' is the conventional name for the hypothetical earliest form of the [[Sindarin]] language, gradually mutated from [[Common Telerin]]. 
==History==
The stage of "Old Sindarin" refers to a period where the Sindarin words had not undergone [[lenition]]s of their consonants, nor affections of vowels by ''[[i-affection|i]]'' or ''[[a-affection|a]]'', nor [[apocope]] of final vowels. The first changes that already occurred in Old Sindarin, which made it differentiate from [[Common Telerin]], was the [[Wikipedia:Voiceless glottal fricative|aspiration]] in some sounds; this can be seen in [[Telerin]] ''[[alpa]]'' but OS ''[[alpha]]'' > S. ''[[alph]]''. Further changes followed in the process of time.

This language was spoken in [[Middle-earth]] during or after the [[Great March]], perhaps by the [[Eglath]]. However when the [[Noldor]] returned to [[Beleriand]] at the rising of the [[Moon]], the language had already fully evolved into Sindarin.

It is possible that Old Sindarin was the common ancestor of [[Mithrimin]], [[Falathrim]] and [[Doriathrin]].

==Other versions==
In published writing referring to the early legendarium, only the term '''[[Old Noldorin]]''' was used. In that early conception, it was the language spoken by the [[Gnomes]] in [[Kôr]], (in contrast to the later legendarium of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', where the Noldor spoke [[Quenya]] both in [[Valinor]] and later in [[Middle-earth]]). Old Noldorin does show some similarities to Quenya and [[Telerin]].

Most of the corpus of ON is given in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' and their purpose is to illustrate the etymology of some [[Noldorin]] words. Even after [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] renamed "Noldorin" into "Sindarin", almost all rules of etymology and derivation have been retained the same (see "'''[[Noldorin]]'''" for the discussion of some minor differences). 

More recent works like ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]'' show ancient forms of Sindarin that seem to possess the same structure and to belong to the same evolution as the Old Noldorin of the ''Etymologies''. It is therefore possible that an ancient form of Sindarin similar to what Tolkien imagined as "Old Noldorin" did exist in the [[First Age]] of his later concepts; but Tolkien did not refer to that stage as a stable, identifiable language and did not go to the process to name it; making "Old Sindarin" to seem a non-canon, but plausible name for it.

Note that in these recent sources, Tolkien provides these forms with an [[asterisk]] as "unattested", suggesting that they belong to an unwritten stage of the language, before the invention of the [[Cirth]]. This is not the case in the "Old Noldorin" forms of the ''Etymologies'' where they are unasterisked, supposedly written with [[Tengwar]] in Kôr.
