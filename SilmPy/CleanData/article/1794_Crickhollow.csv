'''Crickhollow''' was a location, perhaps a small settlement in [[Buckland]], located a short way to the northeast of [[Brandy Hall]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> 

Its most notable spot was an isolated house standing back from the lane in the middle of a wide lawn. It was surrounded by low trees inside an outer hedge, and there were no other dwellings nearby. This house was occasionally occupied with [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] [[Hobbits]] who grew tired of the often crowded [[Brandy Hall]].<ref name="Conspiracy">{{FR|I5}}</ref>

==History==
[[Frodo Baggins]] was instructed by [[Gandalf]] to find a reason why he should leave [[Hobbiton]] (and [[the Shire]]) and meet him in [[Bree]]. In the summer of {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins]] bought this house, as an excuse for leaving [[Hobbiton]] to the east.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

While Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] moved out, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] were already in that house, making preparations for their arrival. They were the only Hobbits who knew that Frodo would begin a journey to the east, so they made preparation for their departure as well.

On [[25 September]], Frodo and his company arrived at the lodgings, and met Merry and Fatty. The next day Frodo and his party departed for the [[Old Forest]]. It was decided that Fatty would stay at Crickhollow to maintain the pretense that Frodo was still in residence to hide his departure.<ref name="Conspiracy"/> Frodo spent only one night; at [[26 September|dawn]] they picked up the ponies from a nearby stable and rode to the [[High Hay]].

In the early hours of [[30 September]] three [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] came to the house in Crickhollow,<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> but Fatty Bolger had already escaped.  He had run to the nearest house and from there he spread news of an invasion, which traveled swiftly to [[Brandy Hall]], and resulted in the rousing of the hobbits of [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

After the [[War of the Ring]], Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

==Etymology==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the first element is obsolete and of obscure meaning. A ''hollow'' is a small depression in the ground.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 768</ref>

Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested a speculative [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Crycholh'' from which Crickhollow derives. The obscure element ''cryc'' could represent, as can be expected in [[Stoorish]], a [[Celtic]] ([[Wikipedia:British language|Old Brythonic]]) word for "hill". The placename would therefore mean "low place by the hill".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

It is not clear in the ''Lord of the Rings'' whether Crickhollow was a village or a region occupied by a solitary house. The [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] mentions Crickhollow as a village<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/crickhollow.html|articlename=Crickhollow|website=[[Encyclopedia of Arda]]|author=Mark Fisher}}</ref>. [[Robert Foster]] describes Crickhollow as a "place in Buckland"<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 75, entry "Crickhollow"</ref> whereas [[Karen Fonstad]] believes that Crickhollow is just the name of Frodo's house.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 120</ref>

== Portrayals in Adaptations ==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Crickhollow is visited by players during the Volume 1 Epic Book, ''[[Stirrings in the Darkness]]''. [[Fredegar Bolger]] is found worrying about the recent attack by the [[Ringwraiths]] on Crickhollow, and the broken door and cloak found in the front. Players must then defend Fredegar from enemy [[Crebain]] that descend to attack.
