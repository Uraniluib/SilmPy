'''''The Peoples of Middle-earth''''' is the twelfth volume of the ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|When [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] laid aside ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1937 the extension of the original 'mythology' into later Ages of the world had scarcely begun. It was in the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that there emerged a comprehensive historical structure and chronology of the Second and [[Third Age]]s, embracing all the diverse strands that came together in the [[War of the Ring]]. The difficulty that he found in providing these Appendices, leading to delay in the publication of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', is well known; but in ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'' [[Christopher Tolkien]] shows that early forms of these works already existed years before, in essays and records differing greatly from the published forms. He traces the evolution of the Calendars, the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] genealogies, the [[Westron]] language or [[Westron|Common Speech]] (from which many words and names are recorded that were afterwards lost), and the chronological structure of the later Ages. Other writings by J.R.R. Tolkien are included in this final volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', chiefly deriving from his last years, when new insights and new constructions still freely arose as he pondered the history that he had created. The book concludes with two soon-abandoned stories, both unique in the setting of time and place: ''[[The New Shadow]]'' in [[Gondor]] of the [[Fourth Age]], and the tale of ''[[Tal-Elmar (chapter)|Tal-Elmar]]'', in which the coming of the dreaded [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ships is seen through the eyes of men of [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Dark Years]].}}
