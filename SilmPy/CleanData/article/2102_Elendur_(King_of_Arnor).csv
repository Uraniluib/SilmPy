'''Elendur''' ({{TA|552}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|777}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 225) was the ninth [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Elendur's rule was uneventful. He ruled Arnor for 125 years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] - the last king of [[Arnor]], upon his death in 777.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Elendur's name is [[Quenya]] for "Servant of the Elves" from ''[[elen]]'' meaning "elves", and the suffix ''[[dur|-dur]]'' meaning "servant of, devoted to". It is likely that he was named in memory of [[Isildur]]'s son who was killed in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]].
