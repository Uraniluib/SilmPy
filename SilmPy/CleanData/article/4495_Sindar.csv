'''Sindar''' (meaning "Grey People"<ref group=note>The singular term would be ''Sinda'' but it was not generally used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]</ref>) or '''Grey Elves''' were [[Elves]] of [[Teleri|Telerin]] descent who inhabited [[Beleriand]]. They were united under the King of [[Doriath]] [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], and later his grandson [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]].

They belonged to the Teleri who did accept the invitation and set out on the [[Great Journey]] and were [[Eldar]], although [[Moriquendi]], never having actually set foot in [[Valinor]], with the [[Calaquendi]]. However they still became the fairest and most wise and skillful of the elves of Middle-earth under the rule of Thingol and [[Melian]] in Doriath, and they are therefore sometimes referred to as '''"Elves of the Twilight"'''.
==History==
===Origins===
The Teleri were the largest of the three hosts of the Eldar. For this reason, they had two leaders during the [[Great March]] from [[Cuiviénen]], the brothers [[Elwë]] (later known as Elu Thingol in the Sindarin tongue) and [[Olwë]].  When the Teleri reached [[Beleriand]], Elwë went wandering in the forests as was his wont.  In the forest of [[Nan Elmoth]] he encountered [[Melian]], one of the [[Maiar]].  They fell in love, and the two stood spellbound in Nan Elmoth for several years.<ref>{{S|4}}</ref>

In the meantime, Olwë and many of the Teleri could not delay longer, and departed for [[Aman]] without Elwë and his following, who preferred to stay in Beleriand, to search for their king. They later became known as the '''''[[Eglath]]''''' (the "Forsaken"). At long last he awoke from the spell and set up a kingdom in the midst of Beleriand: [[Eglador]] ("Land of the Forsaken" or "Land of the Elves"). The [[Dwarves]] of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] were contracted to aid in the building of the city of [[Menegroth]].

Just before the arrival of the [[Noldor|Noldorin Exiles]], the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]] returned to his old stronghold of [[Angband]], and his activities increased. Thingol had Melian use her magic to create a girdle of bewilderment around Eglador, so that nobody could enter without the king's permission. Ever after it was known as [[Doriath]] ("Land of the Fence") and the Sindar who dwelt inside its [[Girdle of Melian|borders]] were called [[Iathrim]] ("People of the Fence"). Thingol remained High King of the Sindar and nominal Overlord of Beleriand, although especially the Noldor following of the sons of [[Fëanor]] usually ignored his commands.

===Distribution===
Other than the Eglath and the Iathrim, other Teleri also stayed in Beleriand and were counted among the Sindar: these were the friends of [[Ossë]] the [[Maia]], who had fallen in love with the shores of [[Middle-earth]], and did not wish to depart. Their leader was [[Círdan]], and they established cities at [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]]. They were known as the [[Falathrim]], or "Elves of the [[Falas]]". They were not part of the realm of Eglador, but still took Thingol as their High King.

Yet other stray bands of Sindar settled in [[Nevrast]] and [[Hithlum]] to the north of Eglador, although these did not form any realms. Those were the [[Elves of Mithrim]].

A last group of Teleri in Beleriand were the [[Laiquendi]] or "Green Elves"; they were not counted as Sindar, because they did not originally abandon the Great Journey in Beleriand. The Laiquendi were descended from the [[Nandor]], a group of Teleri that had split from the Great Journey before the [[Misty Mountains]] and gone south along the [[Anduin|Great River]]. A part of them, under [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]] son of [[Lenwë]], crossed the Blue Mountains eventually, and settled in [[Ossiriand]], or as it was later known [[Lindon]] ("Land of the Singers"). They remained a people apart for long, although many of them removed to Thingol's realm after Denethor was killed.

The Teleri of Eglador, the northlands, and the Falas were collectively known as the Sindar in later days, because they developed a civilisation all its own, which almost equalled that of the [[Calaquendi]] or Light Elves of [[Valinor]].

===Later history===
In the early [[Second Age]], after the [[War of Wrath]], many of the Eldar who had no desire to leave Middle-earth retreated to Lindon. The Sindar mainly concentrated mostly to [[Harlindon]], under the leadership of [[Celeborn]]. Some of them who had no desire to be merged with the other Sindar dominated by the Noldor, left Lindon and came to the forest realm east of [[Misty Mountains]]<ref name="SE-UTb">{{UT|6b}}</ref>. They became the rulers of the [[Silvan Elves]] living there and established the Wooldland Realms of [[Greenwood the Great]] ([[Sindarin|S]] "Eryn Galen") and Lórinand (or Laurelindórenan). The Silvan Elves shared common heritage with the Sindar as both the Silvan Elves (originally known as the ''[[Nandor]]'') and the Sindar were of the [[Teleri]] clan. Sindar soon merged with the Silvan Elves and embraced and adopted their culture, wishing to experience a more "rustic" and "natural" way of life as was the case after their awakening in [[Cuiviénen]].<ref name="SE-UTb"/> Other Sindar had founded the haven of [[Edhellond]] in the south, and they were also joined by Silvan Elves who migrated there.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 247</ref>

==Language==
{{main|Sindarin}}
The language of the Sindar evolved from [[common Telerin]] over the long ages they were sundered from their kin. Among themselves, their own language had no name, as it was the only one that they ever heard, and didn't need any <ref>{{WJ|Quendi}} p.376</ref> but in [[Quenya]], the language was designated as '''[[Sindarin]]'''. During the [[First Age]] there were several dialects that fell under the umbrella of Sindarin: [[Doriathrin]], [[Mithrimin]] and [[Falathrin]]. By the time the Noldor arrived in Beleriand, the languages between the two continents had become mutually unintelligible, but the Noldor were quick to learn it. Sindarin eventually replaced [[Quenya]] as the language used by the Noldor in [[Beleriand]], even in predominantly Noldorin settlements such as [[Gondolin]], although Quenya survived as a language of knowledge.

In the later [[Ages]], Sindarin was the [[Elvish]] tongue used in daily speech throughout [[Middle-earth]]. It was also adopted for daily use by the Men of the [[House of Beor]] and later the [[Númenóreans]], and remained somewhat in use in the realms-in-exile of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].

When the Sindar came to the East to rule over the [[Silvan Elves]], their language was adopted by them who spoke a language of [[Nandorin]] origin. Sindarin soon influenced by Silvan language and this new dialect became known as [[Silvan Elvish]] (or "woodland tongue"). Names such as [[Lothlórien]], [[Caras Galadhon]], [[Amroth]], [[Nimrodel]] are possibly of Silvan origin, adapted to Sindarin.<ref>{{App|Elves}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''Sindar'' ("the Grey" or "the Grey-elves") is not [[Sindarin]]: it is the [[Quenya]] name devised by the [[Noldor|Noldorin]] exiles, derived from [[Primitive Quendian|PQ]] ''[[thindi]]''. A less common Quenya name for this people was ''Sindeldi'' (sing. ''[[Sindel]]'').<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 117</ref><ref name=WJQE11/> 

Why the Sindar had been called the "grey" yielded a discussion among the [[Lambengolmor|loremasters]]. One theory suggested that it referred to [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]'s, and those near akin to him, hair of silver hue (although most Sindar were dark-haired). Another theory suggested that the name was derived from the meaning of ''Thingol'' ([[Quenya |Q.]] ''[[Sindikollo]]''), "Grey-cloak" (the [[Elves of Mithrim|Northern Sindar]] were also said to have been clad much in grey).<ref name=WJQE11>{{WJ|Quendi}}: Sindar" [also, Author's Note 11]</ref> 

The name that the Sindar used for themselves was simply '''''Edhil''''' ("Elves", singular ''[[Edhel]]''). The Sindar considered themselves to be ''[[Calben|Celbin]]'', persons of Light. The Noldor on the other hand, using their own definition of what are "[[Light Elves]]", didn't consider the Sindar to be ''Calaquendi'', which is the [[Quenya]] cognate of ''Celbin''.<ref name=qu/>

In the lore of the [[Dúnedain]] the Sindar (and sometimes the [[Silvan Elves]]<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref>) were also called '''Middle Elves''', distinguishing them from the [[High Elves]] (being of their kin) and the [[Dark Elves]], although the latter term included the Sindar sometimes, because of their ignorance of the [[Light of Valinor]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>
