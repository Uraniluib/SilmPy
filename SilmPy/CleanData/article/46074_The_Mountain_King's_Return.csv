'''The Mountain King's Return''' is a song from the [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|1977 adaptation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Its lyric is based on the poem "[[The King beneath the mountains]]" and was adapted by [[Jules Bass]] with music by [[Maury Laws]]. The song serves mostly as background music to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Thorin and Company]]'s brief interlude in [[Lake-town]] in the film. Unlike the other songs in the film, this one was not included on the accompanying [[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack|soundtrack]].

==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The streams shall run in gladness,
The lakes shall shine and burn.
All sorrow fail and sadness
At the Mountain King's return!

The King beneath the mountain,
The King of carven stone,
The lord of silver fountains
Shall come into his own!

The streams shall run in gladness,
The lakes shall shine and burn.
All sorrow fail and sadness
At the Mountain King's return!

His crown shall be upholden,
His harp shall be restrung.
His halls shall echo golden
To songs of yore re-sung.
</poem>
