{{Pronounce|Dorwinion.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Dorwinion''' or '''Dor-Winion''' was a land which lay on the north-western shores of the [[Sea of Rhûn]], surrounded by the [[River Running]].<ref>{{HM|Map}}</ref> In Dorwinion was made a heady wine, which was strong enough to let even [[Elves]] get drunk and fall asleep.
==History==
Despite its location in the outskirts of [[Rhûn]], the very name of Dorwinion betrayed an influence by the [[Elves]] or the [[Gondorians]] (notably Númenórean influence reached as north as the lands between [[Celduin]] and [[Carnen]]<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>), although it can't be said with certainty who inhabited that land.

What is known is that [[King of Gondor|King]] [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar]] made conquests in the [[East]], so the lands that was or would be Dorwinion probably became part of [[Gondor]]; by the time of [[Hyarmendacil I]] Gondor had reached its greatest extent in all its history. In {{TA|1248}} King [[Minalcar]] and [[Vidugavia]] of the [[Northmen]] also campaigned in the lands between Rhovanion and the Inland Sea.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> In the following centuries the [[Great Plague]] had hit those lands<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> although it is not known how much Dorwinion was affected. 

During the [[Wainrider/Balchoth War|war with]] the [[Wainriders]] ({{TA|1856|n}}), Gondor lost its hold of the eastern lands beyond the [[Emyn Muil]]<ref name=gondor/> thus excluding Dorwinion from its withdrawing borders.

By {{TA|2941}} Dorwinion traded with realms of [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], such as the [[Woodland Realm]]. The special wine of [[Thranduil]] came from that place in crates. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] returned the crates by way of the [[Forest River]] to [[Lake-town]] on [[Long Lake]].<ref>{{H|9}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The name is [[Sindarin]] meaning "Land of Gwinion", whereas Gwinion itself is a name of a country meaning "Young-land"; from ''[[dor]]'' and ''[[gwain]]'' plus the geographical ending ''[[-nd|-iond]]''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 54</ref> The latter part of the name is apparently related to [[Gnomish]] words such as ''gwinwen'' (“freshness”) and ''gwion'' (“young”).

[[Tolkien]] commented that the [[Elvish]] name in such a remote location is a "testimony to the spread of Sindarin".<ref>{{HM|HH}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
''Dor'''v'''inion'' or ''Dor-Winion'' is mentioned in the ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]''; its wine was famous among the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] and [[Menegroth]]. It is said there to lie in the "Burning south" (of [[Beleriand]])<ref>{{LB|1b}} lines 223, 425</ref>, which might suggest it was a different "Dorwinion", or may just have referred to the fact it came from the more southern lands of  [[Rhovanion]] by way of the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand]]. 

While writing the [[Quenta Silmarillion]], Tolkien once mentioned Dorwinion as a location of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 338</ref> Tolkien reused the name and the wines in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', establishing thus that it is somewhere in or near the  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]].

In annotations to [[Pauline Baynes]], Tolkien suggested the name ''Mildor'' meaning "Land of wines", and it was struck out.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=24 March 2018}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
Based on the meaning of its name, [[John Rateliff]] suggests that the name is a reference to the Irish legend of [[Wikipedia:Tír na nÓg|Tír na nÓg]] "Land of the Young". However this similarity rather applies to the earlier phase where Dorwinion was mentioned as a part of Tol Eressea.
