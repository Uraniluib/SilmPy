'''Hathol''' (born {{FA|365}}) was an [[Edain|Adan]], belonging to the tribes of [[Men]] who crossed the [[Blue Mountains]] from the eastern lands. He was the grandson of [[Malach|Malach Aradan]] and son of [[Magor]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) House of Hador''</ref> who had settled with some of his folk among the southern foothills of the [[Ered Wethrin]].<ref name=west/> 

Little is known of his life, except that he probably dwelt with his folk south of the Ered Wethrin, and was not under the service of any Elf-lord of [[Beleriand]]. Hathol was the father of the great hero [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]], who served [[Fingolfin]] and was granted the land of [[Dor-lómin]] to dwell in.<ref name=west>{{S|West}}</ref>
