==Summary==
Tolkien replied to [[Edmund Meskys]], president of the [[Tolkien Society of America]], who had questions about Elvish numerals. Tolkien briefly wrote about the similarities of the Elves and the Babylonians, and then mentioned that he had devised a set of both decimal and duodecimal numbers in [[Tengwar|Fëanorian script]], but that he could not find it. He only remembered that they were written with a positional system like Arabic, and started with the lowest number on the left. 
==Notes==
* The numbers were published in ''[[Quettar]]'' in the 1980s, and now come standard on most [[fonts]]. 
* The Elves used a [[wikipedia:Duodecimal|duodecimal]] system, the men a [[wikipedia:Decimal|decimal]] one.
* The only "mainstream" example of Fëanorian numbers is found in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', in the "[[King's Letter]]". As the writer of this letter was [[Aragorn|Elessar]], the numbers (6341 and 61) were decimal.
