The '''Northern Waste''' was a vast cold region of mostly ice and snow, in the far north end of [[Middle-earth]],<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> beyond the [[Mountains of Angmar]], [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] and the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]]. The main known area was [[Forochel]].

The location was also named '''Forodwaith''' ([[Sindarin|S.]], "Northern lands, people") after the hardy [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]] folk, who inhabited it.

==History==
The Waste had been made very cold earlier in [[Arda]]'s history because of the presence of [[Utumno]] and [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s evil cold emanating from it. The region remained cold even after Utumno's destruction.

The region was once inhabited by a hardy [[Men|Mannish]] folk, the [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]] who gave the region its name. However in later years (possibly suffering by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]) their [[Lossoth|remnants]] retreated to the [[Cape of Forochel]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

[[Dragons]] also dwelt in there<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> and after many years they multiplied and became strong and made [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war]] against the [[Dwarves]]. [[Cold-drakes]] came from the Northern Waste and drove the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]] out of their homes, and most of the Dwarves then moved to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the [[Iron Hills]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

According to [[Frodo Baggins]]'s [[When evening in the Shire was grey|poem for Gandalf]], [[Gandalf]] had travelled to the Northern Waste.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
[[File:Waste vs forodwaith.png|thumb|The different definitions of "Forodwaith" between the earlier and the later map.]]
In the earliest [[General Map of Middle-earth]] by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the northern portion of the [[Westlands]] is featureless, labelled as "Northern Waste", with the name "Forodwaith", in smaller letters, above the [[Mountains of Angmar]]; this seemed to suggest that Forodwaith is a part of the wider Northern Waste, if not a smaller separate region. This nomenclature was carried over to [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''.

Later, Christopher Tolkien realized that the two names are synonymous. The misunderstanding was corrected in the later map known as [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]], where only the name "Forodwaith" appears, labeling all the blank portion north of the [[Mountains of Angmar]] and the [[Grey Mountains]].<ref name=intro>{{UT|IMap}}</ref>
