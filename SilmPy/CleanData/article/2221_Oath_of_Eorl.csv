The '''Oath of Eorl''', also called the '''Oath of Cirion''',<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 20</ref> was the alliance sworn between the nations of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]]. 

Also agreed was whenever help was needed, the two kingdoms would aid each other. The signal that help was needed was the [[Red Arrow]], a symbol of danger. For faster communication between the two allies, the [[warning beacons of Gondor]] were used. These beacons were placed on seven hills along the northern ridge of the [[White Mountains]].

== The Oath ==
[[File:Ted_Nasmith_-_The_Oathtaking_of_Cirion_and_Eorl.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl'']]
The Oath was first sworn in {{TA|2510}} by [[Cirion]], the twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor, and by [[Eorl]], King of the [[Éothéod]] (later first King of Rohan) following the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. The Oath stated that the province of [[Calenardhon]] would be forever of Rohan, established its borders, and an alliance between the kingdoms.  The two rulers swore their oaths on the [[Halifirien]] hill at the site of the [[Tomb of Elendil]].

Eorl spoke his oath in [[Rohirric|his own language]]: 

{{quote|Hear now all peoples who bow not to the Shadow in the East, by the gift of the Lord of Mundberg we will come to dwell in the land that he names Calenardhon, and therefore I vow in my own name and on behalf of the Éothéod of the North that between us and the Great Prople of the West there shall be friendship for ever: their enemies shall be our enemies, their need shall be our need, and whatsoever evil, or threat, or assault may come upon them we will aid them to the utmost end of our strength. This vow shall descend to my heirs, all such as may come after me in our new land, and let them keep it in faith unbroken, lest the Shadow fall upon them and they become accursed.|Eorl}}

In addition to his oath, Cirion spoke an invocation in [[Quenya]] and the [[Westron|Common Speech]], calling the [[Valar]] and [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] to witness the oaths that were taken.  

{{quote|Vanda sina termaruva Elenna-nóreo alcar enyalien ar Elendil Vorondo voronwë. Nai tiruvantes i hárar mahalmassen mi Númen ar i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar eä tennoio.|Cirion}}

Eru's name was very rarely invoked in oaths, and indeed had not been since the time of the [[Last Alliance]].  Among people of Numenorean descent, it was held that only the King could call upon Eru, but Cirion had that authority as Steward and regent for the King.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

==History of the Oath==
In {{TA|2710}} King [[Déor]] asked the help of [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Egalmoth]] to drive off the [[Dunlendings]] from the occupied [[Ring of Isengard]], but a renewed war against the Orcs prevented the Steward from fulfilling the Oath.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

During the rule of [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]], both nations where overwhelmed; Gondor by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and Rohan by the Dunlendings, and couldn't help each other. After the [[Long Winter]] however, as the Rohirrim started to repel the invaders, Gondor afforded sending help from both west and east of the [[White Mountains]] to assist them.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref><ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

Gondor sent great help to King [[Folcwine]] who reconquered the [[Westmarch (disambiguation)|west-march]] from the Dunlendings. In {{TA|2885}}, when [[Ithilien]] was invaded in great strength, Folcwine sent many men, led by his twin prince sons, to Gondor. With their aid Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the [[Crossings of Poros]], though the princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Red Arrow]] was brought to King [[Théoden]] of Rohan by [[Hirgon|a messenger of Gondor]] while [[Minas Tirith]] was besieged by [[Sauron]], and Théoden rode out with the [[Muster of Rohan]] to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. 

The Oath was renewed by [[Aragorn]] and [[Éomer]] upon their accessions to the thrones of Gondor and Rohan.
