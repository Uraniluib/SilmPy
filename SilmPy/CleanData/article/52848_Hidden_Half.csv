The '''Hidden Half''' is the name given to all the parts of [[Arda]] below the edge of the world, where all that existed were the [[Martalmar]], the foundations of the earth, as well as the lowermost regions of the [[Vaiya|Encircling Seas]] and the airs of [[Ilmen]]. The [[Pelóri|Mountains of the West]] and [[Walls of the Sun|East]] prevented anyone from finding the Hidden Half of the world.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}} pp. 242 - 243</ref>

Vaiya, that flows completely around the world, forms a sea below it, and it seems like the world "floats" on that sea. [[Ulmo]] the Lord of Waters dwells in Vaiya, below the Martalmar.<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref>
