The '''Lake-men''' or '''Men of the Long Lake''' were the people of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] upon the [[Long Lake]], south of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. 
==History==
They were [[Northmen]] and their ancestors were related to the [[Edain]].<ref name=guide/> They traded with Erebor and [[Dale]], and with the [[Woodland Realm]] of [[Mirkwood]]. Their life was affected with the arrival of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] who destroyed both Erebor and Dale. Some of the [[Men of Dale]] who survived came to Esgaroth such as [[Girion]]'s descendants. However as the years passed, Smaug was forgotten and children even doubted about his existence or the tales of older men who sometimes had seen him flying.<ref name="Fire"/><ref name=warm>{{H|10}}</ref>

In the autumn of {{TA|2941}} the Lake-men welcomed warmly [[Thorin and Company]] who came to the town to speak to the Master. They saw the [[King under the Mountain]] returning. The Dwarves and Bilbo were hosted, rested and pampered before being sent with boats to the ruins of Dale to confront the dragon.<ref name=warm/>

Some days later, Smaug came against Esgaroth believing that the Lake-men were behind a scheme against him, and attacked to show that he is the true [[King under the Mountain]]. Smaug was killed by [[Bard]] the Bowman, but the dragon fell on the town, destroying it. Having heard of the disaster, some [[Elves of Mirkwood]] came to offer any help that could be provided. The Lake-men were united under Bard, and, some days later, a united host of Men and Elves set forth towards [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], believing that the Dwarves had been among the first casualties of Smaug's wrath. To their surprise they found [[Thorin and Company]] quite alive, having fortified the Mountain, and themselves treated as foes.<ref name="Fire">{{H|Fire}}</ref> Bard, claimed one twelfth of the treasure, one of the reasons being that the men of Esgaroth had helped the Dwarves on their journey and now their homes were burned and their stocks being destroyed by Smaug, whose anger was risen by the Dwarves. Therefore they demanded compensation and Bard intended to pay it from the part of the treasure he claimed.<ref name="Gathering">{{H|Gathering}}</ref>

Thorin however were unwilling to cooperate, especially having the Elves camping below Erebor. He summoned reinforcements from the [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] under [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. The battle seemed inevitable, but [[Gandalf]] intervened, to warn them that [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]], their common foes, are also coming for Smaug's treasure. Then the [[Battle of Five Armies]] begun, and 200 or so Lake-men fought alongside the Dwarves. They were overwhelmed by the superior numbers of Orc warriors, but they were supported by [[Beorn]] and the [[Eagles]].<ref name=Burst>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

After defeating the Orcs and Wargs, the victors divided the treasure. Bard took [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the [[Arkenstone]], whereupon he shared his reward with the [[Master of Lake-town]].<ref name="Return">{{H|Return}}</ref>

Eventually Esgaroth and Dale was rebuilt. Some of the Lake-men were relocated to the newly founded [[Kingdom of Dale]] and near the Lake during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

==Culture==

The town's prosperity was built on trade between the [[Men]], [[Elves of Mirkwood]] and [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. It supplied food and drink to the Elves and the products of Erebor and [[Dale]] were funneled through it.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, pp. 131-2</ref>

The [[Master of Lake-town|Master]] of Lake-town was the elected civic leader who under normal circumstances was chosen from among the old and wise.<ref name=warm/>

As a trading people, the Lake-men knew the Common Speech, [[Westron]]. However, amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, [[Dalian]], loosely related to but distinct from [[Rohirric]] (and other languages of the Northmen).
