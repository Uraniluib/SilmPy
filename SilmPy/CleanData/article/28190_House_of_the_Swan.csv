In ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' [[Tuor]] refers to himself as belong to "the '''house of Swan''' of the men of the North". It is not stated what this refers to, but Tuor's emblem is a [[Swans|swan]] on a blue field and [[Ulmo]] sometimes uses swans to guide him on his journey to [[Gondolin]]. The House Tuor founds in [[Gondolin]] is called the "[[House of the Wing]]" and its emblem is the wing of a "swan or gull".<ref name="LT2Gondolin">{{LT2|III}}</ref> 

It may be supposed that [[Peleg]] and [[Indor]], Tuor's father and grandfather respectively in this version of the [[legendarium]], also belonged to the House of the Swan. Or, alternatively, Tuor may have invented it for himself.

Another explanation is given in the later manuscript ''[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]'', where it is said that the swan was the token of Tuor's foster-father [[Annael]] and his folk, who were indeed "men of the North", dwelling in [[Mithrim]].<ref>{{UT|1}}</ref><ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 205</ref>
