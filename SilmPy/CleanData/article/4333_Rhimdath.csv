The '''Rhimdath''' or '''Rushdown''' was a short, early tributary of the [[Anduin]] River. It flowed from the [[Misty Mountains]] eastward into the Anduin roughly halfway between the [[Langwell]]-[[Greylin]] confluence and the [[Carrock]].<ref name=RS>{{RS|1XIc}}, p. 205</ref> Given the name "Rushdown" it probably had a steep gradient.

The river-name is found as a pencilled addition by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] on the [[:File:CJRT - Map of Wilderland.jpg|map of Wilderland]] in one of his copies of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=RS/> It has been noted that Rhimdath (according to the map) seems to have been joined by another small mountain stream.<ref>[http://www.tuckborough.net/rivers.html#Rushdown Rivers & Falls: Rushdown] at [http://www.tuckborough.net/ The Thain's Book] (accessed 29 April 2011)</ref>

The river-name is also a feature of the first map of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]''. On Map II, in square J-12, both "R.Rushdown" and "Rhimdad" are written next to the short Anduin tributary north of the Carrock.<ref>{{TI|MII}}, p. 305</ref>

==Etymology==
The first element in ''Rhimdath'' is related to [[Noldorin]] ''[[rhib-]]'', ''[[rhimp]]'', ''rhimmo'' ("to flow like a [?torrent]"), derived from the [[Sundocarme|stem]] '''[[RIP|RIP-]]''' ("rush, fly, fling"). [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that the name ''Rhibdath'' or ''Rhimdath'', given the meaning "Rushdown", was a hastily scribbled addition at the end of the R-stems.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 384</ref> In the index he noted that this name only appeared in the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' but is the river described above.<ref>{{LR|Index}}, p. 446</ref><ref group="note">This was before the publication of ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''.</ref>

As the stem '''[[DAT|DAT-]]''' is glossed as "fall down",<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 354</ref> it is possible that the second element in ''Rhimdath'' is a derivative of this stem.
