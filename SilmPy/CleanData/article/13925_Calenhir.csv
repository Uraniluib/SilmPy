'''Calenhir''' was a river in [[Gondor]] that flowed east from the [[Pinnath Gelin]] into the [[Morthond]].  Its name seems to mean "Green River" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''calen'' "green"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''calen''</ref> and ''sir'' "river"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''s»ãr''</ref>).

On the "working map" that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used while writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the river was drawn on the map but only named in the list of the "Rivers of Gondor".<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, West, p. 434</ref>  This river did not appear in the maps of the published ''Lord of the Rings''<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> or the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> and therefore is non-canonical.
