'''Haldar''' was a [[Man]] of the [[Haladin]] who dwelled in [[Thargelion]]. He was the son of [[Haldad]] and brother of [[Haleth]] and had a son, [[Haldan]].

His family survived an [[Orc]] attack against his people. His father built a [[Gelion-Ascar Stockade|stockade]] in defense. In the ensuing siege their food was exhausted, and Haldad was slain during a sortie against the attacking Orcs. Haldar rushed to recover his father's body, and was slain as well.

Haldar thus did not live to succeed his father as [[Chieftain of the Haladin]]. It was his sister [[Haleth]] who took up the rule of her people, but she died childless, and Haldar's son Haldan and his descendants became the rulers of the people later known as the [[House of Haleth]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>
