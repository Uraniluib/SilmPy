'''''Atarincë''''' or '''''Atarinkë''''' was the [[mother-name]] of [[Curufin]], fourth son of [[Fëanor]]. It is translated as "little father" since he bore great physical resemblance to his father (and later to his father in mind).<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of the Sons of Fëanor with the legend of the fate of Amrod'', p. 353</ref>
