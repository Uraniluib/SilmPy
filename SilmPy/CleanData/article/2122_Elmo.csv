'''Elmo''' was an [[Elf]] of the [[Nelyar]] born at [[Cuiviénen]]. He was the brother of [[Thingol|Elwë]] and [[Olwë]]. He remained behind when Elwë was lost, becoming one of the [[Sindar]] of [[Doriath]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Elmo was developed to explain the reference in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' that [[Celeborn]] was a "kinsman of Thingol". One of the solutions was to establish Celeborn as the son of an unimportant brother of Thingol.

In other, later writings, Celeborn is made into a [[Teleri]]n Elf, and a relative of Olwë of [[Valinor]] instead, but this was not further developed or published.
