'''Meril-i-Turinqi''' (alt. '''Meril-i-Túrinqi'''<ref>{{HM|SM}}, p. 72</ref>) was the Lady of [[Tol Eressëa]] in the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. She was also known as the ''Lady of the Isle''.

Meril was of the line of [[Ingwë|Inwë]] or Inwithiel, being his great-granddaughter, but was also akin to the [[Solosimpi]]. Long ago she had seen the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Faëry]].<ref name=LTV>{{LT1|V}}</ref> 

Later she dwelt in a white house inside a great ''[[korin]]'' (a great circular hedge around a green sward) of the most ancient [[elms]], near [[Ingil]]'s tower. She was of great beauty and accompanied by [[Elves|Elven]] maidens.<ref>{{LT1|I}}</ref><ref name=LTIV/>

[[Littleheart]] brought [[Eriol]] to her house who requested to taste some ''[[limpe]]'', seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves. Turinqi denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a [[mortal]] [[Man]], as [[Ilúvatar]] made his [[Children of Ilúvatar|Children]] different, and drinking ''limpe'' would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would at a time long for his lands again.<ref name=LTIV>{{LT1|IV}}</ref> To explain better she told him the story of the [[Awakening of the Elves]] and their bliss in [[Valinor]].<ref name=LTV/>
