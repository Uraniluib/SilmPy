*[[Quenya]]: ''[[morna]]'' ("black", adjective)<ref name=PE17/><ref name=L297/>; ''[[mornie]]'' ("blackness", noun)<ref name=PE17/>; ''[[more]]''<ref name=L297/>

*[[Sindarin]]: ''[[morn]]''; ''[[môr]]''<ref name=L297/>

==Other versions==

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] appears the root MOR-, yielding [[Primitive Quendian]] ''mori'' ("black"). From this root derives such words as:<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 373-4</ref>

*Quenya: ''[[morna]]'' ("gloomy, sombre"); ''[[mordo]]'' ("shadow, obscurity, stain, smear, dimness")<ref name=VT45a/>

*[[Noldorin]]: ''maur'' ("gloom"); ''[[Morn#Other versions|morn]]'' ("black")<ref name=VT45a>{{VT|45a}}, p. 35</ref>

*[[Ilkorin]]: ''môr'' ("night")

==Examples==

The element ''mor'' appears in a large number of compounds. [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes in the [[Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] that the entry MOR- is "''extremely confused through changes and afterthought additions''" and that it is not clear if "''all the forms given were intended to stand''".<ref name=LR/> It can therefore be hard to know if the element ''mor'' in a compound is supposed to consist of a certain derivative of MOR.

==Inspiration==

Based on manuscripts held at the [[Cushing Memorial Library and Archives collection]], Madeline J. Keyser has suggested that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was inspired by a real-world word ''mora'', which "''seems to be of North (Scandinavian) and West Germanic origin — the Latin root is found in Modern English words such as murky, and in other Germanic words associated with darkness''". A manuscript note appears to consist of the glosses ''mora'' "dark", ''moranya'' "darker", and ''moranta'' "darkest".<ref name=Sixteen>{{webcite|author=Madeline J.
