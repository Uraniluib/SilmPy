'''Ortírielyanna''' is a translation of the ''[[wikipedia:Sub tuum praesidium|Sub tuum praesidium]]'' into [[Quenya]] made by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the 1950s. It was published in [[Vinyar Tengwar|''Vinyar Tengwar'', issue 44]] in 2002, edited by [[Patrick H. Wynne]], [[Arden R. Smith]], and [[Carl F. Hostetter]].

The ''Sub tuum praesidium'' is the oldest known hymn to Virgin Mary and is often used in Christian services as a prelude to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary (also known as the [[wikipedia:Blessed Virgin Mary|Litany of Loreto]]). In 1944, Tolkien recommended his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] to learn "''the Litany of Loretto (with the prayer Sub tuum praesidium)''" by heart<ref>{{L|54}}</ref>. It was therefore logical that Tolkien created his own [[Quenya Litany of Loreto]], which immediately follows in the same manuscript as the ''Ortírielyanna''.<ref>{{VT|44a}}, p.11</ref>
