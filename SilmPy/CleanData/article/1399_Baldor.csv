}}'''Baldor the Hapless''' was the prideful son of [[Brego]] and grandson of [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]]. 

==History==
With his father, Baldor explored [[Rohan]], and came to [[Harrowdale]]. They found the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Surprised by a riddle from an old man that forbade them passage, he became curious. At the inauguration of [[Meduseld]] in {{TA|2569}}, he vowed to pass the [[Dark Door]]. He did so a year later, and was never seen again alive.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 

Early March {{TA|3019}}, [[Aragorn]] and the [[Grey Company]] found the golden-clad knight. His legs were broken, and his sword was notched.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>
