'''Núneth''' was the wife of [[Beregar]] and the mother of [[Erendis]], who unhappily married [[Tar-Aldarion]].  Núneth and her family lived in the western part of Númenor before Erendis left to join the household of Queen [[Almarian]].  

Despite knowing her daughter's headstrong nature, Núneth urged her to marry the prince and gave her advice over the years.  

When Erendis dismissed the Elven-birds that had dwelt in her garden in [[Armenelos]] they flew to her parents' house and Núneth correctly divined that it was a sign that Aldarion had left his wife.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Núneth'' is [[Sindarin]] and means "Woman of the West" (from ''[[annûn]]'', 'West', and ''[[-eth]]'', a feminine suffix).
