==Extract==

{{quote|The ''[[Half-elven]]'' (Pereldar) were thus all closely akin, being descended on the mortal side from the [[House of Hador|House of ''Hador'']], and the [[House of Bëor|House of ''Bëor'']]: the two chief houses of the Elf-friends ([[Dúnedain]]) from whom most of the [[Númenóreans|Numenoreans]] came; and on the elvish side from the [[House of Finwë|''House of Finwe'']] (the greatest of the Kings of the [[Calaquendi|High-elves]] who went to the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]]) and from the House of [[Thingol|''Elwë'' (''Elu-thingol'')]] who remained in the west of [[Middle-earth]]. But since ''[[Melian]]'', wife of Thingol and mother of [[Lúthien]] came of the people of the [[Valar]] a strain of the 'race divine' was also possessed by them.|J.R.R.
