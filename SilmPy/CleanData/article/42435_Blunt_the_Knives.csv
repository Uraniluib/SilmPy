{{Blockquote|<poem>
Blunt the knives, bend the forks
Smash the bottles and burn the corks
Chip the glasses and crack the plates
That's what [[Bilbo Baggins]] hates!

Cut the cloth, tread on the fat
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat
Pour the milk on the pantry floor
Splash the wine on every door!

Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl
Pound them up with a thumping pole
When you're finished if they are whole
Send them down the hall to roll

That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!</poem>|''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Special Edition]]'' booklet}}
