'''Durin VII''' (lived in the [[Fourth Age]]) was the last of the six reincarnations of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].

==History==
The actions of Durin VII were prophesized long before he was born, at the time of the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|Durin}}</ref> 

Durin VII was the direct descendant of king [[Thorin III Stonehelm]] (according to some sources, his son).<ref name="Making">{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278-9</ref> 

He led [[Durin's folk]] back to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and restored the ancient kingdom during the [[Fourth Age]]. There his house remained until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
