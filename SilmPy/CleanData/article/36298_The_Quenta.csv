'''The Quenta''' is the third chapter of ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'', the fourth book in the series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.

==Quenta Noldorinwa==

This is the second version of the text that would eventually become the published [[Quenta Silmarillion]], after the Sketch of  the Mythology included in the previous chapter, "[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]".

The text cites as its in-universe source Eriol's Book of Lost Tales, itself based on the Golden Book in Koromas (a city on [[Tol Eressëa]] which is here and elsewhere called [[Kortirion]], after the city in Valinor which in later versions would be simplified to [[Tirion]]). In earlier versions the Golden Book of Tavrobel was written by Eriol or a later author. 

Though a book by the same name is mentioned here, there is no evidence that Tolkien consulted the physical manuscript called [[The Book of Lost Tales]] at any point in the process of writing the Quenta. 

==Old English==

Included in this chapter are surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon translations of the Annals of Valinor, the Annals of Beleriand, and Quenta Noldorinwe, as well as the Old English equivalents of various Elvish names. All of this is attributed in-universe to [[Ælfwine]].

====Valar====
The [[Valar]] as a whole are called the ''Fréan'' (singular ''Fréa'', meaning "ruler" or "lord"), ''Ese'' (singular ''Os'', meaning "god"), ''Brega'' (singular ''Bregu'', "ruler" or "lord"), or ''Mægnu'' (singular ''Mægen'', "power" or "might"). ''Mægen'' appears in the Old English translation of the Quenta included in this chapter.

[[Manwë]] is ''Wolcenfréa'' (from ''wolcen'', meaning "sky"), and [[Melkor]] (here called Melko) is ''Manfréa'' (''man'', meaning "evil" or "wickedness"), ''Bolgen'' (meaning "wrathful"), and Malscor (related to ''malscrung'', "bewildering" or "bewitching"). [[Ulmo]] becomes ''Garsecges fréa'' (''Garsecg'', a name for the Sea), ''ealwæter-fréa'' (''eal'' "all" + ''wæter'' "water"), and ''agendfréa ealra wætera'' (which adds the term ''agend'', "owner"). This last name for Ulmo comes from the Old English translation of the Quenta that appears in this chapter.

[[Aulë]] is ''Cræftfréa'' (''cræft'', "power" or "art"), Tulkas is ''Afodfréa'' (''afod'' or ''eafod'' "might, strength"), and [[Oromë]] is ''Wáðfréa'' (''wáð'' "hunting"), ''Huntena fréa'' (''huntena'' "of hunters"), ''Wealdafréa'' (''wealda'' "of forests"), which is a translation of Oromë's [[Noldorin]] epithet ''Tauros'' (which would be replaced by ''Tauron'' in later versions of the Legendarium) that appears in the Old English Quenta, and ''Béaming'' (''béam'' "tree"), which is a translation of his Quenya epithet ''Aldaron''. The [[Fëanturi]], [[Námo]] and [[Irmo]], are called Nefréa (''ne(o)'' "corpse") and Swefnfréa (''swefn'' "dream") -- in the Old English Quenta Námo is also called ''neoaerna hlaford'' ("master of the houses of the dead"). 

[[Ossë]] is listed here as well, and given the name ''Sǽfréa'' (''sǽ'' "sea").
