In the 80's and 90's, a variety of '''Multi-User''' computer based games came out, either by professional companies or individual programmers. Though outdated in design, many are still active. The games involved multiple users logging in and interacting with each other; in many ways they were the precursors of modern MMPORGs like ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.

There have been several types of ''Multi-User'' games:
* '''MUD''': Multi-User Dungeon
* '''MUSH''': Multi-User Shared Hack
* '''MUX''': Multi-User Experience
