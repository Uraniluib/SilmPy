'''Iúmonna Gold Galdre Bewunden''' is a poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The [[Old English]] title of the poem is taken from a line of verse contained within ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', which in modern English reads: "the gold of men of long ago enmeshed in enchantment" (l. 3052).<ref>{{L|235}}</ref>

The poem was published by Tolkien in three different versions. The first version was published in January [[1923]] within ''The Gryphon'' (n.s.4, no.4) as "Iúmonna Gold Galdre Bewunden". A heavily revised version, although bearing the same title, was then published in the ''Oxford Magazine'' 55, no.15 ([[4 March]] [[1937]]). The third version, differing little from the second but bearing the title "[[The Hoard]]", was finally published in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book]]'' in [[1962]]. 

The original 1923 version was reprinted in [[Douglas A. Anderson]]'s ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]''. Both the 1923 and 1937 versions were reprinted in ''[[Beowulf and the Critics]]'' in 2002 along with one intermediate version.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 383</ref>
