The '''Three-Farthing Stone''' was a stone by the side of the [[East Road]] that marked the point where the borders of the [[Eastfarthing]], [[Westfarthing]] and [[Southfarthing]] of the Shire came together.<ref name="Part">{{FR|Part}}</ref> It was also said to mark a point near the centre of [[the Shire]] itself.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> The stone stood about five miles south-east from [[Bywater]], and exactly fourteen miles west from [[Frogmorton]].

The fourth farthing, the [[Northfarthing]], did not meet the others at the Three-Farthing Stone.<ref name="Part"/> Instead, its borders met those of the Westfarthing and Eastfarthing about ten miles north of the Stone, though there is no record of a second three-farthing stone to mark this spot.

In late {{TA|3019}}, [[Samwise Gamgee]] stood near the stone and cast the remnants of the dust of [[Lothlórien]] into the air, sharing [[Galadriel]]'s gift with a [[Shire]] still depleted by the rapaciousness of [[Sharkey]] and his men.


==Inspirations==
Tolkien may got this idea from the [[Four Shire Stone]].
