{{quote|To the lineage of Gondor he added the fearless spirit of the Northmen. He was handsome and valiant, and showed no sign of ageing more swiftly than his father.|[[Appendix A]]}}
'''Eldacar''' ({{TA|1255}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1490|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 235 years) was the twenty-first King of [[Gondor]].  He was the son of [[Valacar]] and [[Vidumavi]] and born with the name '''[[Vinitharya]]'''.

==History==
Eldacar's father Valacar had gone to live among the [[Northmen]] of King [[Vidugavia]]'s realm in {{TA|1250}}.  While there Valacar fell in love with and married the King's daughter, princess Vidumavi.  Their son, named Vinitharya, would later be called Eldacar.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  In {{TA|1260|n}} Valacar brought his family and a household of noble Northmen back to Gondor.<ref>{{PM|Ai}}</ref>

The high men of [[Gondor]] frowned upon Valacar's marriage to a woman of alien and [[Middle Men|"lesser" race]] for they feared that Vidumavi's descendants would prove short-lived.  As Valacar grew old rebellion smouldered in the southern fiefs of Gondor since many refused to accept Eldacar as their upcoming lord.  When Eldacar succeeded his father in {{TA|1432}} full civil war erupted, called the [[Kin-strife]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

Eldacar showed no sign of more rapid aging than any of the [[Dúnedain]] and displayed fearlessness in opposing those who sought to depose him.  However, the rebels came against him in great strength and lay a siege that laid waste  to [[Osgiliath]] (and caused the loss of the ''[[Osgiliath-stone|palantír]]'' kept in the Tower of the Stone). As Eldacar fled the city to [[Rhovanion]] a distant relative named [[Castamir]] claimed his throne and had Eldacar's son [[Ornendil]] put to death.

Eldacar gathered together his kinsfold in Rhovanion, those Northmen who had served Gondor, and many of the Dúnedain from the northern parts of Gondor.  After ten years of exile Eldacar led a great army to reclaim his Kingship.  His forces were augmented by the people of [[Calenardhon]], [[Anórien]], and [[Ithilien]]. In this he was aided by the cruelty and lack of generosity of Castamir, and by Castamir's disdain for the land with his plan to remove the seat of the King to [[Pelargir]]. The [[Battle of the Crossings of Erui|greatest clash]] during Eldacar's return took place at the [[Crossings of Erui]].

Although Eldacar himself avenged his son Ornendil by slaying Castamir, the sons of the Usurper escaped from the battle and held out at Pelargir.  Gathering the remainder of their forces these sons then sailed to [[Umbar]] which then became a refuge for all enemies of the King.  The independent lordship of Umbar would remain at war with Gondor for generations, a constant threat to its coastlines and sea traffic.

Eldacar lived for 235 years, which showed that his mother's lineage had not diminished his lifespan as feared.  Eventually he was succeeded by his younger son [[Aldamir]].<ref name="Gondor"/>
