'''branda''' in [[Telerin]] means "lofty, noble, fine". 
==Etymology==
[[Primitive Elvish]] (perhaps [[Common Telerin]]) was ''b'randâ''<ref>{{HM|LR}}, [[The Etymologies|Etymologies]] p. 351</ref>, apparently representing an even more primitive adjective *''barándâ'' (stem [[BARAT|BARÁD]]).

----
'''branda''' in [[Westron]] means "border, march"<ref>{{HM|AF}}</ref>. The [[Hobbitish]] name [[Brandagamba]] (translated as [[Brandybuck]]) is derived from this word and the ending ''-gamba''. Though a better translation of the name would be "Marchbuck," Tolkien translated it "Brandybuck" in order to retain the connection with the [[Brandywine]] River.<ref>{{HM|AF}}</ref>

----
Perhaps it comes from a possible [[Adûnaic]] *''barrad'', root [[BAR]].
