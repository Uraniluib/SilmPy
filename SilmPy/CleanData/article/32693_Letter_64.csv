==Summary==
Tolkien missed his son and said that war was an utter stupid waste – materially, morally, and spiritually.  Always was (despite the poets) and always will be (despite the propagandists), but in 30 years few will have the direct experience that goes to the heart.  Sometimes Tolkien felt appalled at the sum total of human misery at the present moment.  Were it visible the planet would be enveloped in a dense dark vapor.

Although the products of worldwide anguish would be mainly evil (historically considered) there was a value in all things and deeds.  Evil vainly laboured with vast power and perpetual success, which prepared soil for unexpected good to sprout in.  Though we needed all human courage and religious faith to face the evil we could still pray and hope.  Tolkien called Christopher a special gift and was certain that there was no end to their love.

Tolkien had recently been too tired to attend the [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]] "séance".  He hoped to see him the next day and read more of "the Ring", which had been growing and sprouting.  He listed the latest adventures of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]: Going through [[Sarn Gebir]], climbing down the cliff, taming [[Gollum]], crossing the [[Dead Marshes]], and arriving at the [[Black Gate|main gates]].  That being impassable they headed towards [[Minas Morgul|Minas Morghul]]<ref group="note">"Morgul" was spelt "Morghul" in this letter.</ref> and [[Cirith Ungol|Kirith Ungol]].  [[Ithilien]] was lovely, there was bother about stewed rabbits, they were captured by [[Gondorians]], and witnessed them ambushing a Swerting army.  An elephant of prehistoric size is loose and Sam has his life-long wish of seeing an [[Oliphaunts|Oliphaunt]].  In the upcoming next chapter they reach Kirith Ungol and Frodo gets caught.  Tolkien then included the whole poem "[[Oliphant]]" in the letter.  Sam treats Gollum like [[Wikipedia:Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] treats [[Wikipedia:Caliban|Caliban]].

Tolkien noted that it was spring but decried the roar and riot of noise of all the "infernal combustion" engines.  Humanity, he said, and even more, engineers, were both nitwitted and malicious as a rule.  He felt the tenuousness of communication by flimsy bits of paper and wished it could be written in Runes beyond the Craft of [[Celebrimbor]] of [[Hollin]] to fill Christopher with visions.  Tolkien had first begun to write the ''History of the Gnomes''<ref group="note">An early title for ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.</ref> in army huts and now his son was in the same prison.
