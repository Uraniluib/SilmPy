==Summary==
Tolkien was told that it was desirable to have separate titles for each of the three volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', referring to Tolkien's 24 March letter (see [[Letter 136]]) in which he had made suggestions for such sub-titles.  Tolkien had no copy of his earlier letter and asked if [[Allen and Unwin]] could send him one.  He opposed having separate titles for each volume, wanting ''The Lord of the Rings'' as the over-all title, although that was least suitable for the first volume.  His suggestions were: "I. The Return of the Shadow", "II. The Shadow Lengthens", and "III. The Return of the King", but with the over-all title to prevent confusion.  Tolkien was not wedded to any suggested sub-title and wished they could be avoided.  The division of two "books" per volume was purely a convenience due to length.

What position did the publishers have about reproducing the burned pages of the "[[Book of Mazarbul]]"?  Tolkien claimed that the text was pointless without them.  He also had the drawing of the [[Doors of Durin|secret door]] that he would re-draw and improve, having finished correcting the galleys.  He apologized for not re-drawing the essential maps, having had no respite from drudgery, but he would turn to them at once.
