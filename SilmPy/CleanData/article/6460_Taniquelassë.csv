'''Taniquelassë''' was a [[Fragrant Trees|fragrant evergreen tree]] brought to [[Númenor]] from [[Tol Eressëa]] by the [[Elves]]. After the downfall of Númenor they were not found within the circles of the world.<ref name=UTNum/>

Taniquelassë, among the other trees brought to Númenor, grew mostly up the sheltered seaward slopes of [[Nísimaldar]] in the [[Bay of Eldanna]] but they also spread far east into the land.<ref name=UTNum>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
