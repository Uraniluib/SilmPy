'''''The Tolkien Family Album'''''<ref>Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull gives "''A...''" for the HarperCollins edition (in ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]''). However, "[http://www.locusmag.com/index/b474.htm#A6945.2 The Locus Index to Science Fiction: 1984-1998]" (external link) gives the opposite ("''A..''" for the Houghton Mifflin edition and "''The...'' for the HarperCollins edition). In addition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull follows the latter in another text, [http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=236962 "Truth or Consequences: A Cautionary Tale of Tolkien Studies"] (external link). Hammond kindly replied in an email sent on 19 april 2010 that ''The Tolkien Family Album'' was the title used for both the UK and US editions of the books, and that the error will be noted in a future corrigenda to the ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]''.</ref> is a publication showing photographs of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his family, including other illustrations and memorabilia. Biographical information accompany each photograph.

The book was issued in 1992 to celebrate the Tolkien Centenary.

==From the publisher==

This biography of Tolkien looks at the family details of the author's life. It tells of his love affair with Edith Bratt, and the dramatic circumstances of their relationship and eventual marriage; of Tolkien's experiences in World War I; of the birth of his children; his academic career, and of the writing of the books that made him a household name all over the world. The book also takes a look at the often strange fan mail that he received, and the honours bestowed upon him before and after his death.
