'''''A Short History of English Poetry''''' is a book which includes Stanza 32 from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s Modern English translation of the [[Middle English]] poem "[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]". The text as printed here contains a number of minor variations compared to the text published in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo]]'' (1975).

Tolkien entered into negiations with Heinemann and James Reeves in [[1959]] to publish the complete translation, but later had to withdraw when he realised that he had already offered it to [[Allen and Unwin]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=51470|articlename=Short History of English Poetry. 1961|dated=|website=TB|accessed=2 May 2012}}</ref>
