'''Dragon Flame''' is a freeware application based on [[Didier Willis]]' [[Hiswelókë|Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary]]. It was first released in December [[2002]]. The latest version, Dragon Flame 2.0, for Windows is from December [[2003]], but there is a more recent Dragon Flame 2.0.1. for Linux (July [[2004]]). It should be noted that much material has been published since then; Dragon Flame incorporates lexicon version 0.993, but the current (as of April [[2007]]) version of Hiswelókë's Dictionary is 0.99499. 

There will be no new versions of the program; only Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary will be updated [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/34887], and is of better use as a source than Dragon Flame.
