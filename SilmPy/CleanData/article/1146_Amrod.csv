'''Amrod''' (died in {{FA|538}}) was the sixth of the seven [[Sons of Fëanor]].<ref name=Eldamar>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref><ref name=Flight>{{S|Flight}}</ref> [[Amras]] was his twin brother, and the younger of the two.<ref name=Sons>{{PM|XI7}}</ref> Although they greatly resembled each other in face and mood, Amrod's hair became a darker shade than Amras's after childhood.<ref name=Sons/>

== History ==
He joined his brothers in the [[Oath of Fëanor]], but his mother Nerdanel begged that either he or Amras be left behind, believing in her heart that one would not return. Fëanor, however, refused her this kindness, and the quest for the [[Silmarils]] cost them both their lives. Though "in later days [after departing from [[Aman]]] they were great hunters in the woods of Middle-earth,"<ref name=Eldamar>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref> and they did not greatly participate in the northern [[Siege of Angband]],<ref name=Beleriand>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> both were lost in the [[Third Kinslaying]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=Voyage>{{S|Voyage}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Amrod's [[father-name]] was '''[[Pityafinwë]]''', or "Little Finwë", as he was the second youngest of the [[House of Finwë]]. The short form of his name was [[Pityo]], "Little One". His [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was originally '''[[Ambarussa]]''' ("Top-russet", referring to his hair), the same as his twin Amras, but Fëanor insisted that the twins ought to have different names and Nerdanel prophetically called him '''[[Umbarto]]''', "The Fated" (from ''[[umbar]]'' = "fate"). His father, disturbed by it, changed it to '''[[Ambarto]]''', "Upwards-exalted" (from ''[[amba]]'' = "upwards, top" and ''[[arta]]'' ="exalted", "lofty"). Nevertheless both twins called each other ''Ambarussa''. Others most often called him '''[[Atyarussa]]''', which means "Second-''russa''".<ref name="Sind">{{VT|41b}}</ref>

Amrod is the [[Sindarization]] of ''[[Ambarto]]'',<ref name="Sind"/> while '''[[Amarthan]]''' is the Sindarization of ''[[Umbarto]]''.<ref name="Sind"/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', there is a short legend of a different fate for Amrod which results in a separation of the twins that does not appear elsewhere. In this legend, which exists in a draft created as an account for the names of the sons of Fëanor, the reason for Amrod's initial mother name Umbarto 'fated' is revealed. Also, the twins were reversed in this legend, and Amrod ('Umbarto' or 'Ambarto') becomes the younger and Amras ('Ambarussa') the elder.<ref name=Sons/>

In {{YT|1497}} Amrod was accidentally killed in the swan ships of the [[Teleri]] when his father ordered them to be burnt at [[Losgar]]. According to the ''[[Shibboleth]]'', Amrod claimed (to Amras) to have felt uncomfortable sleeping on the ground after the Noldor landed on the [[Lammoth]]. It was thought later that he wished to return to his mother in the ship after being shocked by his father's deeds in [[Alqualondë]]. Fëanor was probably aware of his dissension, and this may have been one of the elements in his decision to burn the ships even before all the food and stores had been removed. Yet he was dismayed when he learned of his son's death but covered his pain with bravado and stated, when Amras asked if he woke up Amrod before burning the ship he was on:
{{blockquote|"'That ship I destroyed first,' said Fëanor (hiding his own dismay). 'Then rightly you gave the name to the youngest of your children,' said Ambarussa, 'and Umbarto "the Fated" was its true form. Fell and fey are you become.' And after that no one dared speak again to Fëanor of this matter."|{{PM|XI7}}}}
In earlier stages of the Legendarium, Fëanor's sons had different slightly different names. Amrod used to be called Damrod.<ref>{{LT2 | IV}}, pp. 241, 251</ref>

In the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', he lived south of [[Lothlann]], southeast of [[Himlad]], southwest of [[Thargelion]], and east of [[Doriath]] in the wide-plains of [[East Beleriand]] and ruled with his twin Amras over those lands west of the [[Blue Mountains]] and the River Gelion.<ref name=Beleriand/>{{rp|map}}

There is no trace of the death of Amrod at Losgar in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', as it was a very late idea by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] that did not develop beyond an inked draft before it was abandoned.<ref name=Sons/>{{rp|360-1}} Although there is a brief margin note referring to the tale, that one of Fëanor's youngest sons died aboard a burning ship at Losgar, in the ''Annals of Aman'',<ref>{{MR|P2m}}</ref>{{rp|128}} the "strange and sinister" incomplete draft material, which separated the twins very early in their tale was omitted by [[Christopher Tolkien]].<ref name=Sons/>{{rp|355}} In ''The Silmarillion'', Amrod's life and death happen alongside his brother's and not as an individual role.
