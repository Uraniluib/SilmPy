'''''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Beginner's Guide''''' is an elementary school-level introduction to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], written by Andrew Blake.

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|Examining the novels and other writings, Andrew Blake shows how J.R.R. Tolkien's mastery of language, his establishment of a fully-fledged alternative mythology, and his brave way of looking at difficult questions have helped to inaugurate a new way of writing which re-established "fantasy" as a late 20th century genre.}}
