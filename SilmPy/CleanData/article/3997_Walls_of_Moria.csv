The '''Walls of Moria''' were the western rocky cliffs at the base of the [[Misty Mountains]].

The [[Doors of Durin]] were built upon that surface, and by the craft of its makers, the doorway blended into it when closed.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

Before the Walls, there was a shallow valley climbing westward to a small cliff and then to a road between the [[Stair Falls]], and the ancient [[Eregion]]

:Fellowship passes the Walls of Moria before reaching the Durin's Gate.

'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'':'''
:The Walls of Moria are a small sub-area of Eregion, where the Iron Garrison, an expedition of Dwarves from [[Erebor]] and the [[Iron Hills]], seek to gain entry into [[Moria]]. Players must pass through this place before entering the Mines themselves. This may not be so easy considering the [[Watcher in the Water]] still lurking in the deep waters.
