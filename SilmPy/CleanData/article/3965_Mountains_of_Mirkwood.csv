The '''Mountains of Mirkwood''' lay in the central parts of northern [[Mirkwood]], north of the [[Old Forest Road]]. A jumble of fir-covered, low-lying hills to the west rose to greater heights in the east, together forming a range nearly one hundred miles in length.<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> Historically, the [[Second Age]] saw these mountains inhabited by [[Silvan Elves]], who knew the range as the ''Emyn Duir'', the Dark Mountains.

During the [[Third Age]], the power of [[Sauron]] spread across the [[Mountains]] as it did throughout the rest of the Forest, they became populated by hideous creatures. Just as [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] was renamed Mirkwood at this time, its northern hills also took on a new name: ''Emyn-nu-Fuin'', the Mountains of Mirkwood.<ref>{{UT|7}}, Note 14</ref>
