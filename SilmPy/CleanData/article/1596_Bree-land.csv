The term '''Bree-land''' referred to the land around the [[Bree-hill]], which contained a few settlements:<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref>

*'''[[Bree]]''' proper was on the south-western side of [[Bree-hill]], the major township of the area with the famous ''[[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony]]'' inn.

*'''[[Staddle]]''' was populated primarily by hobbits who made a living from light agriculture, of pipeweed, which the hobbits were especially fond of smoking. Staddle was on the south-eastern side of Breehill, sitting south of Combe and Archet. It was the only of the villages (other than Bree itself) visible from the [[East Road]].

*'''[[Combe]]''' was populated primarily by Men, with some hobbits, all of whom made a living from agriculture. Combe was situated on the borders of the '''[[Chetwood]]''' and on the edge of Breehill, between the villages of Archet and Staddle.

*'''[[Archet]]''' was the settlement furthest north. Located in the [[Chetwood]], it was populated primarily by [[Men]].

==History==
The origins of its [[Men of Bree|inhabitants]] are obscure, but apparently they were [[Pre-Númenóreans]], related to the [[Dunlendings]], who had moved far to the North during the [[Dark Years]], and the Bree-landers managed to survive through the violent history of Middle-earth until they were absorbed into [[Arnor]]. It was also the only place of Middle-earth where Men lived with Hobbits on a daily basis: the population of the Bree-land had become a mix of Men and Hobbits, who had migrated from [[Angmar]] around {{TA|1300}}.  The ratio varied between each of the four townships of the Bree-land. 

In any case, they were still thriving in Bree long after Arnor had collapsed and the memory of [[Kings of Arnor|fallen kings]] faded into the grass. The now independent land enjoyed the (unknowing) protection of the [[Rangers of the North]]. After the [[War of the Ring]], Bree-land became part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Bree-land was a major region, that covers a large area: from [[Buckland]] in the far west to the [[Weather Hills]] to the far east. The [[Old Forest]], [[Barrow-downs]], [[Midgewater Marshes]] and [[Chetwood]] were all included within its boundaries. During the [[War of the Ring]], Bree-land was threatened by both [[Isengard]] and [[Angmar]]. [[Saruman]]'s thugs and [[half-orcs]] came up from the south and barricaded the [[Greenway]] at [[Andrath]]. Angmar temporarily secured the allegiance of the Blackwold bandit gang and invaded the northernmost reaches of the region with [[orcs]].
