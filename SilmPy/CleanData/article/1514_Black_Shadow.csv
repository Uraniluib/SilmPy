'''Black Shadow''' was an evil blight inflicted by the [[Nazgûl]], causing their victims to slip into a dark cold sleep and never recover. Those striken by the malady murmured in their sleep until a grey shadow fell on their faces as they fell into the darkness.

After the [[Witch-king]] led the [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]], news of a "Black Shadow" reached [[Eriador]] and [[Gandalf]] realized it was the sene of danger that he sense approaching.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

During the [[Siege of Gondor]] many wounded and those striken by the Black Shadow were in the [[Houses of Healing]] but the healers could not find a remedy.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>
