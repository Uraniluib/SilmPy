==Summary==
Tolkien said his heart and mind were on ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' but he had little time for it.

The Fifteenth World Science Fiction Convention got Tolkien to come to a lunch wherein he was awarded the International Fantasy Award, an absurd massive metal "model" of a Space-rocket combined with a lighter (which being useless wound up sitting in a window).  However, the speeches were good, especially that of [[Wikipedia:Clemence Dane|Clemence Dane]].  Sir [[Stanley Unwin]] attended too.

Tolkien reported that as a backwash from the Convention was a visit from an American film agent.  He came in a taxi from London, in the company of strange men and stranger women.  This [[Wikipedia:Forrest J Ackerman|Mr. Ackerman]] brought astonishingly good pictures and remarkable colour photographs (shots of American mountain and desert scenes that seemed to fit the story).  The Story Line though was bad, but perhaps business could be done.  Stanley Unwin and Tolkien had agreed on a policy: ''Art or Cash''.  Either very profitable terms or absolute author's veto of the objectionable.
