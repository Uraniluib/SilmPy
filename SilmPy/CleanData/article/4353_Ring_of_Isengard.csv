{{disambig-more|Isengard|[[Isengard (disambiguation)]]}}
The '''Ring of Isengard''' refers to the rocky walls that surrounded and protected the [[Orthanc|Tower of Orthanc]]. They grew out of the wall of a valley at the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains]], and were worked by the early [[Gondorians]] so that they formed a complete defensive circle around the tower. They were torn down by the Ents to make way for the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]] at the end of the Third Age.
