'''Narchost''' was the western<ref name=UI/> of the two [[Towers of the Teeth]],<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref> that stood on two hills either side of the [[Black Gate]] of the Morannon, guarding the northwestern entrance into [[Mordor]].  Narchost and its companion [[Carchost]] were originally built by the [[Gondorians]], as a guard upon Mordor after [[Sauron]]'s first defeat.  As Gondor's strength waned, Narchost was abandoned and left to decay, until Sauron returned to his ancient land.  His forces took over both the old guard-towers and repaired them, so that at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], they formed part of Sauron's own defences.<ref name="Towers">{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
 
In his [[Unfinished index]] for ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien translated the [[Sindarin]] name ''Narchost'' as "bitter-biting fort".<ref name=UI>{{HM|UI}}, p. 601</ref> Its initial element ''narch'' "bitter-biting" is not otherwise attested, but a similar ([[Noldorin]]) verb ''[[narcha-]]'' "to rend" appears in the ''Etymologies'' as a derivative of the root [[NÁRAK]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, NÁRAK</ref> The second element is ''[[ost]]'' "fortress".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''os(t)''</ref>
