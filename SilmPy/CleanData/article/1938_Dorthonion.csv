{{Pronounce|Dorthonion.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Dorthonion''' was a forested highland region in the north of [[Beleriand]] which spanned sixty leagues from west to east.<ref> {{LR|Quenta}}, p. 272</ref> The hilly north-eastern section was called '''[[Ladros]]'''. Dorthonion was walled-in by the [[Echoriad|Echoriath]] ("Encircling Mountains") in the west and the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] ("Mountains of Terror") in the south.<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref>

From the plains of [[Ard-galen]] to the north, Dorthonion rose gradually until it became a bleak land of tarns and bare tors near the precipices of the Ered Gorgoroth. In the north and the west the land was covered with great forests of pines.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> The rivers [[Rivil]] and [[Mindeb]] had their sources in these uplands, as did the lake [[Aeluin]].<ref name="Map"/> In the centre of the land was a tall peak called [[Foen]].<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, pp. 183, 187</ref>

==History==
During the tumult when the [[Valar]] broke the gates of [[Utumno]] after the awakening of the [[elves]], the highlands of Dorthonion were first raised.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>.

In year {{FA|6|n}} of the [[First Age]]<ref>{{GA|64}}</ref> King [[Thingol]] gave permission to the [[Noldor]] to settle the northern lands of Beleriand.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> North Dorthonion was ruled by the Elf-lords [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] and Ladros was ruled by [[Finrod]].<ref name="Beleriand"/>

Later Finrod and his people removed to [[Nargothrond]] in the south, whilst Angrod and Aegnor ruled over those of their folk who still dwelt in Dorthonion, as vassals of their brother <ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>. Ladros was then granted by [[High King of the Noldor]] [[Fingolfin]] to the House of Bëor as a fiefdom.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>

In {{FA|455}} Dorthonion was overrun by the armies of [[Morgoth]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame") and thereafter was called '''[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]''' ("Forest under Nightshade").<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> [[Barahir]] refused to forsake Dorthonion and remained with twelve companions near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. Through the treachery of [[Gorlim]] nearly all of this band were killed, save for the son of [[Barahir]], [[Beren]]. Beren followed the [[Orcs]] who had killed his father to [[Rivil's Well]]. He then killed the Orc captain and recovered the [[Ring of Barahir]]. Eventually he was pursued so closely that Beren fled from Dorthonion over the [[Ered Gorgoroth]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Many, many years later, on [[29 February]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Treebeard]] chanted to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] as he carried them through [[Fangorn Forest]] and he mentioned "''To the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the Winter.''"<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Dorthonion means "Land of the Pine Trees" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[dôr]]'' = "land, dwelling-place" and ''[[thôn]]'' = "pine tree").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>

In a philological fragment of uncertain date it is stated that Dorthonion was also called '''''Taur-na-Foen''''', the Forest of the Foen.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 187</ref>
