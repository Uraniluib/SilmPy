''Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!''
''Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!''
''Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!''

''Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!''
''Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.''
''Dawn along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,''
''Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,''
''There my pretty lady is, [[River-woman]]'s daughter,''
''Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.''
''Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing''
''Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?''
''Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o,''
