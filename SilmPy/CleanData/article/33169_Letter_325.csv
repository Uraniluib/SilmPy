==Summary==
"Immortals" permitted to seek [[Aman]] sailed in ships specially made and hallowed for this voyage, and steered due West towards the ancient site of [[Valinor]] and [[Tol Eressëa|Eressëa]].  They only sailed after sundown, but a keen-eyed observer watching one of these ships would never see it [[Wikipedia:Hull-down|hull-down]] but only dwindled by distance.  It followed the straight road to the true west and not the bend of the earth's surface.  Those who took the road could not return.

The angelic immortals, the [[Valar]], and others of the same order but less in power, needed no transport unless they had become incarnated.  As for [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] or other mortals, they could only dwell in Aman for a limited time.  It was a peaceful and healing "purgatory" from which they would die at their own desire and free will.

This general idea lay behind the events of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  It was not put forward as geologically or astronomically "true"; it is part of the legends of "Mannish" origin blended with those of the [[Sindar]] (who had never left Middle-earth).
