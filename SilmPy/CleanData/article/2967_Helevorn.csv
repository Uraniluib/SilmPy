After the return of the [[Noldor]] to [[Middle-earth]] the people of [[Caranthir]] dwelt about the lake.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>  Its waters were defiled by [[Orcs]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame").<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>  It was destroyed in the [[War of Wrath]] along with [[Mount Rerir]], though it partially survived.
