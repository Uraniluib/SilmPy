'''A Tribute to Tolkien''' is the title of an article written by [[Robert Murray]] and published in ''The Tablet'', 15 September 1973. 

The article includes recollections of Tolkien by Murray. Sometime in August [[1973]], Tolkien, Murray and perhaps some other people, were having lunch. Murray writes: 

{{quote|Ronald was maintaining with great vigour over the luncheon table that one of the greatest disasters of European history was the fact that the Goths turned Arian: but for that, their languages, just ready to become classical, would have been enriched not only with a great bible version but also, on Byzantine principles, with a vernacular liturgy, which would have served as a model for all the Germanic peoples and would have given them a native Catholicism which would never break apart. And with that he rose and in splendidly sonorous tones declaimed the Our Father in Gothic.|"A Tribute to Tolkien", pp. 879-80}}
