'''Glirhuin''' was a [[Men|mortal]] of the [[Haladin]], a [[Seers|seer]] and [[Minstrels|harp-player]] who lived in the Forest of [[Brethil]] in the [[First Age]].  

Glirhuin composed a song that said that the [[Stone of the Hapless]] would never be defiled by [[Morgoth]] nor sink below the sea. Indeed after [[Beleriand]] fell beneath the waves still [[Tol Morwen]] stood alone above the waters.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
