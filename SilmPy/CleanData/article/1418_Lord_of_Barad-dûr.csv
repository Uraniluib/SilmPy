The Dark Tower of [[Barad-dûr]] was first raised in [[Mordor]] during the second millennium of the [[Second Age]]. [[Sauron]] first dwelt there as its Lord for a period of more than 1,600 years, between about {{SA|1600}} (when it was completed) and {{SA|3261|n}} (when he travelled to [[Númenor]] for a time). He returned to become the Lord of the Dark Tower again after the [[Downfall of Númenor]], and soon after began his wars with its exiles, under [[Elendil]] and his heirs. 

The first of those wars ended after the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], when its Lord [[Sauron]] was thrown down, and his spirit cast out of his body. After that time, [[Barad-dûr]] was demolished, and the ways into [[Mordor]] were guarded by the [[Gondorians]] to prevents its old master's return. So [[Sauron]] was an exile from his own land throughout most of the [[Third Age]], but late in that Age, with the guard of [[Gondor]] long since abandoned, he took his opportunity to escape back into [[Mordor]], and rebuild the Dark Tower. From that time, and throughout the [[War of the Ring]], he became the Lord of Barad-dûr once more.
