[[Image:John Howe - The Door of Night.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Howe]] - ''The Door of Night'']]The '''Door of Night''' was a guarded portal in the distant [[Uttermost West]], through which [[Morgoth]] was cast after his defeat in the [[War of Wrath]]. Its origins are unclear: according to some accounts, it was made by the [[Valar]] as a passage for the Sun, which would return into the World through the [[Gates of Morning]] in the east.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref> According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway through which to expel Morgoth.<ref>{{SM|5}}</ref>
The Door of Night was guarded by [[Eärendil]], bearing his [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] aloft in his shining ship [[Vingilot]].
