'''Little Gelion''' was a lesser river that rose beneath [[Himring]] in the north marches of [[Beleriand]], whose spring was close by that of the [[Celon]]. Where the Celon ran southwest towards the borders of [[Doriath]], the Little Gelion followed a twisting course to the southeast, where it joined with the [[Greater Gelion]] to form the long river [[Gelion]] itself.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  The river formed the southwest border of the ward of [[Maglor]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>
