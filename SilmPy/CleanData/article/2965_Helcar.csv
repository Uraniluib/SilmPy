In an early conception of the [[legendarium]], '''Helcar''' or '''Helkar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[ˈhelkar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[ˈxelkar]}}) was one of the two towers that held one of the [[Two Lamps]] created to light [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Helkar was a great tower, raised by [[Melkor]] to house the ''southern'' of the [[Two Lamps]] fashioned by [[Aulë]] to illuminate [[Middle-earth]]. The tower was extremely tall, rising to the stars, and shone like pale blue crystal. Aulë claimed that Helkar and its southern twin [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]] were made of a strong, imperishable substance that he had devised; in reality he lied for they were made of ice (a material unknown to the other [[Valar]]).  When Aulë's lamps were placed upon them (silver in the north and gold in the south) the ice melted and caused great floods to pour into the seas.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 69-70</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] noted that the story of the Lamps in its early stage was very different from the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.  It is Melkor, not Aulë, who built the two towers.  The name "Helkar" disappeared as the name for the southern tower; eventually the [[Sea of Helcar]] would be the body of water formed at the roots of [[Illuin]], the ''northern'' tower and lamp. The only remaining influence from the older version of the story was that the fall of the towers created inland seas, a vestige of the notion that the towers had been made of ice that melted.<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 87</ref>
