{{lolcantos}}This [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Canto]] is one of the most popular, due to its opening 93 lines (3538-3631) concerning the duel of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Morgoth]].  After this interlude the lay recommences on the [[Quest for the Silmaril|Quest]], where [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] reach the Gates of [[Angband]], and meet the great [[werewolf]] called [[Carcharoth]] the Red Maw.  Carcharoth hails Beren as [[Draugluin]], whose shape Beren bears, asking how he escaped.  Beren responds that he has urgent business with [[Morgoth]], and prays that Carcharoth let them aside.  The wolf agrees uneasily, but is suspicious of Lúthien in her [[vampire]] form.  But Lúthien swift casts her hideous raiment aside and throws a spell of sleep upon Carcharoth, and he is "as lightning stroke/had felled a huge o'ershadowing oak".
