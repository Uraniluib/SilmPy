{{quote|[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] saw her whom few [[mortals]] had yet seen; '''Arwen''', daughter of [[Elrond]], in whom it was said that the likeness of [[Lúthien]] had come on earth again; and she was called [[Undómiel]], for she was the Evenstar of her people.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Many Meetings]]<ref name="Many">{{FR|II1}}</ref>}}

'''Arwen Undómiel''' (''Arwen'' is [[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈarwen]}}; ''Undómiel'' is [[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[unˈdoːmi.el]}}), often called '''Arwen Evenstar''', was one of the [[half-elven]], married to [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]. She was the daughter of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]]. <ref name="Tale"/>

She was considered to be the fairest of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], resembling [[Lúthien]] of the [[First Age]] who would never again appear in [[Middle-earth]]. Her romance with [[Aragorn]] was reminiscent of that between the Man [[Beren]] and the Elf Lúthien.  Like Lúthien, she rejected her [[Elves|Elven]] immortality to marry Aragorn and die with him.<ref name="Tale"/>

== History ==
[[File:Anna Lee - Evenstar.jpg|thumb|left|Anna Lee - ''Evenstar'']]

Arwen was born in {{TA|241}} and was the younger sister of [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]]. From her mother she inherited the [[Elfstone]].<ref name="CG">{{UT|6}}</ref> As one of the half-elven, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate. She lived most of her life in [[Imladris]], or in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandparents.<ref name="Tale"/>

Her father fostered the sons of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], who were the exiled [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> It was in {{TA|2952}} when she returned from Lothlórien to Rivendell when she met a young foster-son of her father, [[Aragorn]]. The young [[Dúnadan]] fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Arwen did not return his love.<ref name="Tale"/>

Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. Whether Arwen chose to marry him and become mortal, or remain with her kin as one of the Elves, she would be parted from either Elrond or Aragorn for ever.<ref name="Tale"/> 
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Aragorn and Arwen.jpg|thumb|left|Stephen Hickman - ''Aragorn and Arwen'']]
It was not until they met many years later in Lórien that Arwen returned Aragorn's love, and in {{TA|2980}} they plighted their troth on [[Cerin Amroth]]. Aragorn gave her the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name="Tale"/>

Arwen was later reunited with Aragorn when he brought the [[Hobbits]] to [[Rivendell]], during the [[War of the Ring]]. She was present at a feast attended by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Later that night, she and Aragorn spoke together.<ref name="Many"/> When the Fellowship departed and [[Galadriel]] offered them [[Gifts of Galadriel|her gifts]], Arwen's Elfstone, given from Galadriel to Celebrían, and Celebrían to Arwen, was the gift for Aragorn. He would wear the Elfstone ever after. <ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref>

Arwen wove the [[Livery of Elendil]] for Aragorn from black cloth, decorating it with [[mithril]], gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of [[Rangers of the North]] to Aragorn before he took the [[Paths of the Dead]], thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> The banner was unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to triumphantly announce the King's return.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
[[File:Janka Latečková - King and his Queen.jpg|thumb|right|Janka Latečková - ''King and his Queen'']]
Arwen wed Aragorn after the War of the Ring when Aragorn became King of the new [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Arwen chose a fate different from her father's and did not sail to the [[Aman|West]]. Instead, she gifted Frodo, as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], passage in her stead, as she foresaw that his burden would not be lifted. She also gifted him with necklace with a white gem. <ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

As Queen of Gondor, Arwen maintained a close connection with Gondor's allies, as did her husband. In [[Fourth Age 22|Fo.A. 22]], she took as a maid of honour [[Elanor Gardner]], daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]]. <ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> She was mother of one son, [[Eldarion]], and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aragorn's death, Arwen departed from Minas Tirith and returned to the abandoned Lothlórien. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in {{FoA|121}} at [[Cerin Amroth]], and was buried there.<ref name="Tale"/>

== Genealogy ==
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Lord of Rivendell.jpg|thumb|Arwen in Rivendell]]
Arwen was actually a very distant relative of Aragorn, being his first cousin sixty-three times removed. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the [[Half-elven]] were joined.<ref>{{App|A1}}</ref> Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves ([[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and brothers [[Olwë]] and [[Elwë]]) as well as the only line with [[Maiar]]in blood through Arwen's great-great grandmother, [[Melian]].

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Arwen Undomiel.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Arwen''''' means "Noble Maiden" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[ara]]-'' = "noble" and ''[[gwenn]]'' = "maiden").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 205</ref> Tolkien remarked that it also means "greatly blessed" in Welsh.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to S.E.O. Joukes, 28 August 1967]]"</ref>

The [[Quenya]] form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his Quenya greeting, Aragorn refers to her again as "Arwen" (''Arwen vanimelda, namárië!'').<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> This suggests that the form '''Arwen''' itself is also coincidentally a valid, or at least understandable, Quenya calque (using ''[[ar]]-'', stem ''Arwend-'').  

Her [[epessë]], '''[[Undómiel]]''', means "Evenstar", from ''[[Undómë]]'' "evening twilight" and ''[[elen|el]]'' "star".

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Arwen does not appear.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Arwen is voiced by [[Sonia Fraser]].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the [[Council of Elrond]]. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the [[The Riddle of Strider|Riddle of Strider]]. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely [[Kath Soucie]]. 

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Arwen is played by [[Liv Tyler]]. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem inspired by ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''. 

:In the first film, she rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was [[Glorfindel]] who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]],a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father. 

:There are  scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for [[Valinor]], and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion. 

:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick with grief possibly over Aragorn's seemingly hopeless cause and his impending death. Elrond takes the reforged [[Narsil]], now [[Andúril]], to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with [[the One Ring]], and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Arwen is a non-playable character and can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from Rivendell into the Misty Mountains. She was not involved in the main storyline - or any side-quests for that matter - until 2010, when she passed Halbarad the banner she had made for Aragorn during the Epic Book [[Oath of the Rangers]].

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While spotting appearance of [[Liv Tyler]], her role is closer to the book that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from movie adaptation. She is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].
