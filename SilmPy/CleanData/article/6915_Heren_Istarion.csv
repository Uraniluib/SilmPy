'''Heren Istarion''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] "Order of Wizards") was the title assigned to the [[Wizards|Istari]] of the [[Third Age]].  None except [[Elrond]], [[Círdan]], and [[Galadriel]] knew of what kind and from where they came.  Among [[Men]] it was initially assumed that the wizards were also men who by long and secret study had acquired great knowledge of lore and arts.  However, as the Third Age passed it was marked that the wizards did not die and so Men began to believe that they were of Elven-kind.

In truth the Heren Istarion had been created in [[Valinor]].  A council of the [[Valar]] was called by [[Manwë]] which resolved to send three emissaries.  Initially only Curumo (Saruman), chosen by [[Aulë]], and Alatar, chosen by [[Oromë]], stepped forward.  Manwë then asked for Olórin (Gandalf) and commanded him to go.  Curumo took Aiwendil (Radagast) with him because [[Yavanna]] begged him to do so and Alatar took along his friend Pallando.

Círdan witnessed the landing of the Order c. {{TA|1000}}.  Their "mission" was to advise and persuade Men and Elves to resist [[Sauron]].  The number of members of the Heren Istarion was unknown but to the North of [[Middle-earth]] came five.  One was clad in white, two in sea-blue, one in earthen brown, and one in grey.

The wizard in white was [[Saruman]], regarded by all as leader of the order.  The two in blue were [[Alatar]] and [[Pallando]], who journeyed far into the East.  The one in brown was [[Radagast]] and the one in grey was [[Gandalf]], seemingly the oldest and the least of the Order.<ref name="Istari">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>

The Heren Istarion came to an end with the passing of Sauron.  Saruman died in Middle-earth and was not allowed to return to the West.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>  Gandalf, who remained true to the mission of the Order, departed from Middle-earth in {{TA|3021|n}}.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>  The fate of the other three wizards who landed in the North is unknown.<ref name="Istari"/>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', while no mention is made of an Order of Wizards, Gandalf tells [[Beorn]] that Radagast is his "cousin".<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  In the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' it is said that the wizards appeared in Middle-earth about {{TA|1000|n}},<ref name="Istari"/> but in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' a rough note by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] said that the [[Blue Wizards]] (Alatar and Pallando, or [[Morinehtar]] and [[Rómestámo]]) came much earlier in the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{PM|Last}}, The Five Wizards, pp. 384-385</ref>  [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that much of the writings about the Istari are rapid jottings and often illegible.<ref name="Istari"/>
