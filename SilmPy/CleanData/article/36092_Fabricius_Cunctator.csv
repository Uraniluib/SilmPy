'''Fabricius Cunctator''' (vulgarly known as "Sunny Sam") was the local blacksmith for the village of [[Ham]].  He had gotten his nickname for his slow, gloomy disposition and his propensity of foretelling disasters on a daily basis.  Despite his reluctance he was persuaded by the villagers to collect all the metal rings he could find in his smithy for them to sew onto [[Farmer Giles]]' old leather jerkin and breeches.  The smith even supplied an old iron frame of a helmet that the cobbler covered with leather.

Whenever trouble appeared in the tale Sunny Sam became more cheerful, but when things appeared to be going well the blacksmith turned dour.  Eventually, when Farmer Giles became king, he outlawed unpleasant prophecy and Fabricius Cunctator changed his profession to the perhaps more suitable one of undertaker.<ref>[[J.R.R.
