'''Dor-Cúarthol''', the "Land of Bow and Helm", was a name given to the area [[Talath Dirnen]] around [[Amon Rûdh]], between [[Teiglin]] and the edges of [[Doriath]].<ref name=turin/> The name comes from [[Beleg]]'s [[Belthronding|great bow]] and the [[Helm of Hador]] borne by [[Túrin]] whose [[Gaurwaith|outlaw band]] protected that land from [[Orcs]] between {{FA|487}} and {{FA|489|n}}.
==History==
Amon Rûdh was the old home of a family of [[Petty-dwarves]], [[Mîm]] and his sons, when Túrin and his outlaws came requesting to stay, threatening the Dwarf with his life. One day in the midst of winter, Beleg, having been seeking out his old friend, brought to him the Helm of [[House of Hador|his ancestors]], and joined the outlaws. Together, the [[Two Captains]] defended that region against the [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]]. Túrin took a new name, ''[[Gorthol]]'', from the dreadful Helm he was wearing.<ref name=turin>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

The rumour that the Two Captains who fell in [[Dimbar]] rose again, travelled to all [[Beleriand]] and their deeds were heard in [[Menegroth]], [[Nargothrond]] and [[Gondolin]]. Many leaderless and dispossessed wanderers took heart and came to seek them. The Orcs didn't dare to enter it, afraid of the hidden terror watching from the hill.<ref name=turin/> 

But the fame of the Two Captains also reached [[Angband]], and perceiving that "Gorthol" was truly Túrin the son of [[Húrin]], Morgoth sent his spies to watch the lands around this hill. Mîm eagerly betrayed the outlaws to the Orc captain. The outlaws were routed, Beleg was left for dead, and Túrin was captured and led away to the north.<ref name=turin/>
