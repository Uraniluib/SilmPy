The ingredients of silima were known only to Fëanor, though it was said to be made of the blended light of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]].  It suffused the crystalline structure of the jewels and gave them a radiance that shone even in the dark, yet gleamed more brightly when exposed to light.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>
