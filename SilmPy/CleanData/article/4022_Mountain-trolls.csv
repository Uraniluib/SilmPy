'''Mountain-trolls'''  were used by [[Sauron]] to wield the great battering-ram, [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]], at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> Mentioned only once in the written records of [[Arda]], nothing else is known of these creatures. One can only assume that this breed of [[trolls]] lived in some of the [[:Category:Mountains|mountains]] of [[Middle-earth]], and that they were larger than the [[hill-trolls]].
