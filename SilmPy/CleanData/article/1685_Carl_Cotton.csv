'''Carl "Nibs" Cotton''' was the youngest child of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Tolman Cotton]].

==History==
Born in {{SR|1389}},<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> Carl and his siblings spent much time in Bywater, and used to swim in the [[Bywater Pool]] with the Gamgee children often.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref> He had not yet come of age when the [[Ruffians]] entered [[the Shire]], so his father ordered him to guard the house with a pitch fork while his father and brothers fought in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Carl was probably named after his ancestor, [[Carl (son of Cottar)|Carl, son of Cottar]]. The nickname "Nibs" has been a term of mock respect in historical English.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>
