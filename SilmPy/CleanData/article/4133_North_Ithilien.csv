'''North Ithilien''' was the northern part of [[Ithilien]] between the [[Anduin]] and the [[Ephel Dúath]] and was somewhat less extensive than its southern counterpart. The refuge of [[Henneth Annûn]]<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> and the [[Field of Cormallen]]<ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref> were to be found in this region.
