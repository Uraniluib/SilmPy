'''Radagast the Brown''', also known as '''Aiwendil''', was one of the [[Wizards]] sent to [[Middle-earth]] to contest the will of [[Sauron]]. Originally a [[Maiar|Maia]] of [[Yavanna]], he had a strong affinity for animals. He dwelt, for a time, at [[Rhosgobel]] on the western eaves of [[Mirkwood]], near the [[Gladden Fields]] on the [[Anduin|Great River]].<ref name="UTIstari"/><ref name="FRCouncil"/>

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - Mage of Rhosgobel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jef Murray]] - ''Mage of Rhosgobel'']]
The [[Maia]] Aiwendil was an [[Ainu]] who existed before [[Time]], and one of the [[Spirits (creatures)|spirit]]s who descended to [[Arda]] in order to serve the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> Aiwendil was a servant of the Valië [[Yavanna]], the Queen of earth.<ref name="UTIstari"/>

After the Undying Lands were separated from Arda during the [[Downfall of Númenor]], [[Manwë]] was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of [[Middle-earth]]. He summoned a council of the [[Valar]] and it was decided that they would send emissaries to Middle-earth. [[Aulë]] chose [[Saruman|Curumo]], [[Oromë]] chose [[Blue Wizards|Alatar]], and Manwë chose [[Gandalf|Olórin]]. Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him. 

In c. {{TA|1000}}, the Maiar arrived upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old [[Men]], whom the peoples called [[Wizards]]. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.<ref name="UTIstari"/>
===Travels in Middle-earth===
When the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but Radagast was never much of a traveller.<ref name="FRCouncil"/> There is not much to be told about his early journeys, but by the late [[Third Age]] he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time at least, at [[Rhosgobel]] somewhere between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Old Forest Road]].<ref name="UTIstari"/> Situated on the western borders of [[Mirkwood]], it can be assumed that the Wizard held watch against the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] that slowly engulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the inhabitants of that region. Close to animals and birds, he was friends with the [[eagles|great eagles]].<ref name="FRCouncil"/> Although the neighboring [[Beorn]] was unsociable, he used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast "not bad" for a Wizard.<ref name="HQueer">{{H|Queer}}</ref>

In {{TA|2851}} the [[White Council]] met once more and, after that, Saruman began to search the [[Gladden Fields]] for [[the One Ring]].<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> Radagast decided to aid his search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that Saruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the Ring for himself.<ref name="SRings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

[[File:Angelo Montanini - Radagast.jpg|thumb|[[Angelo Montanini]] - ''Radagast'']]By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Radagast did not dwell any more in Rhosgobel. In summer {{TA|3018}} Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once. Radagast did not know much of [[Eriador]] but sought for [[the Shire]], knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.<ref name="FRCouncil"/> 

Indeed, on [[Mid-year's Day|Midsummer's Day]], Radagast was sitting on the side of the [[Greenway]] with his horse near [[Bree]] when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the [[Nazgûl]] were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of [[the Shire]]. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to [[Orthanc]]. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.<ref name="FRCouncil"/> 

By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of [[Gwaihir]].<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the [[Council of Elrond]], many scouts were sent out from [[Rivendell]] to many different locations. Some passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] and eventually came to [[Rhosgobel]], but they found that Radagast was not there.<ref name="FRSouth">{{FR|South}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
{{Blockquote|Radagast is, of course, a worthy wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name="FRCouncil"/>}}
Little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining characteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and Gandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power and wisdom.<ref name="UTIstari"/>

As one of the [[Maiar]] of [[Yavanna]], Radagast had a great interest in the [[kelvar]] and [[olvar]] of [[Middle-earth]] and was a friend to beasts and birds.<ref name="UTIstari"/><ref name="FRCouncil"/> 
Gandalf, however, held greater knowledge of birds and beasts than Radagast, as well as greater respect received from them.<ref name="RC.245">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 245</ref>

Radagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him an ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services to help the White examine the Gladden Fields.<ref name="SRings"/> Saruman in turn considered him simple and foolish.<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

==Etymology==
===Radagast===
In a manuscript written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]  in [[1954]], the name ''Radagast'' is said to mean "tender of beasts" in [[Adûnaic]], the language of the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="UTIstari"/> However, in a later note Tolkien said that the name is in the language of the [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]], and that its meaning is not interpretable.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note 4</ref>

As stated by [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]], several theories have appeared concerning the inspiration of the name ''Radagast''.<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 240-1</ref> One such theory has been proposed by [[Douglas A. Anderson]], who notes the name [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radegast_%28god%29 ''Redigast''] in Slavic mythology.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 167</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests another source of inspiration in the [[Gothic]] chieftain ''[[Wikipedia:Radagaisus|Radagaisus]]'', whose name (as noted by [[David Salo]]) is rendered ''Rhadagast'' in some works from the 18th and 19th century (e.g., ''King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Boethius' De Consolatione Philosophiae'', translated by J.S. Cardale in 1829).<ref>{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 278-8, 291</ref>

The similarity to [[Old English]] ''rudugást'' meaning "red-brown spirit" has also been noted by fans.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/r/radagast.html‎|articlename=Radagast|dated=|website=EoA|accessed=}}</ref>

===Aiwendil===
The name ''Aiwendil'' (pron. {{IPA|[aɪˈwendil]}}) is [[Quenya]] for "lover of birds".<ref name="UTIndex">{{UT|Index}}</ref> It is obviously derived from ''[[aiwe]]'' ("(small) bird") and ''ndil'' ("devoted to").<ref name=RC/><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 348, 378 (entries [[AIWĒ-]] and NIL-, NDIL-)</ref>

==Names==
It appears that in [[Valinor]] Radagast was known as "Aiwendil".<ref name="UTIstari"/>

As one of the [[wizards]] sent to [[Middle-earth]], he was known as "Radagast [[the Brown]]". [[Saruman]], when talking to [[Gandalf]], mocked Radagast by calling him "Radagast the [[Bird-tamer]]", "Radagast [[the Simple]]", and "Radagast [[the Fool]]".<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
From the first drafts of ''The Hobbit'', [[Gandalf|Bladorthin]] identifies Radagast as a fellow wizard and as his 'cousin'. [[John D. Rateliff]] notes that, at this stage in the development of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[legendarium]] there was no reason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that it is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence (following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by saying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the attack on the [[Sauron|Necromancer]].<ref name="HHMedwed">{{HH|Medwed}}, "(vi) Radagast"</ref>

Early in the process of writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it is clear that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale.<ref>{{RS|New}}, p. 379;{{RS|Elrond}}, p. 397</ref> He eventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting Gandalf to Isengard.<ref name="TIC1.130-140">{{TI|C1}}, pp. 130-140</ref>

Initially Gandalf describes Radagast as his 'cousin',<ref>{{TI|C1}}, p. 131</ref> as he did in ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref name="HQueer"/> but in a subsequent draft he becomes his 'kinsman'.<ref>{{TI|C2}}, p. 149</ref> In the final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is 'one of my order'.<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

Tolkien initially called him "Radagast the Grey", but in pencil he changed this to "Brown" and subsequently Saruman refers to him as "Radagast the Brown".<ref name="TIC1.130-140"/>

When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered handing over Isengard to Radagast.<ref>{{TI|Story}}, p. 212</ref>

===Films===
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Radagast is entirely omitted. Without Radagast's involvement, [[Gandalf]] goes to [[Isengard]] of his own accord (because he wanted counsel from [[Saruman]]) and is able to escape from the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]] by speaking to a moth who sends for the help of the [[Eagles]].

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Although Radagast is only briefly mentioned in ''The Hobbit'', Radagast features in ''The Hobbit'' films and is played by [[Sylvester McCoy]].<ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> He is highly eccentric and somewhat absent-minded, and also uses a sled pulled by several large [[rabbits]] (which he refers to as '[[Rhosgobel]] Rabbits') as his main means of transportation.

:After discovering that a shadow has fallen on [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] (having had to heal his hedgehog friend [[Sebastian]] because of its power), Radagast enters [[Dol Guldur]] and is attacked by the [[Witch-king]]. He finds that the fortress is occupied by a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] and travels to inform Gandalf. He finds [[Thorin and Company]] just west of [[Rivendell]] and hands Gandalf a [[Morgul-knife|morgul blade]]. He draws a pack of [[Wargs]] and their [[Orcs|Orc]] riders away on his rabbit-pulled sled so that Thorin and Company can flee in safety.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Radagast briefly appears, investigating the [[High Fells of Rhudaur|High Fells]] with Gandalf, and accompanying him to Dol Guldur. Gandalf then dispatches him to send news of what they've found to [[Galadriel]], while Gandalf enters the fortress ruins alone.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Radagast first appears when he comes in Dol Guldur during the [[Attack on Dol Guldur |attack]] by the [[White Council]] to take the weakened Gandalf to safety. After they escape, Gandalf requests a horse, takes Radagast's staff and also commands him to summon 'bird and beast' for the impending [[Battle of Five Armies|battle]]. He arrives with the Eagles late in the battle along with [[Beorn]]. They demolish the Orc forces and effectively help end the Battle of Five Armies.

'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC Radio's The Lord of the Ring]]'':'''
