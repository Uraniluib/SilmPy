Following the tradition of their forerunners the [[Edain]], the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Middle-earth]] kept a calendar that took its month-names from the [[Sindarin]] language. In that calendar, '''Gwaeron''' was the third month of the year, with a name equivalent to the more widely used [[Quenya]] [[Súlimë]]. Both these [[Elvish]] names are a reference to the winds of this season of the year.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
