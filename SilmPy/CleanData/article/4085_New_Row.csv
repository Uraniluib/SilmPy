The '''New Row''' was a row of [[hobbit-holes]] cut into the southern face of [[Hobbiton Hill]] after the [[War of the Ring]]. They were made to replace [[Bagshot Row]], which had been destroyed by [[Ruffians|Sharkey's Men]].  It became a jest in [[Bywater]] to refer to New Row as "Sharkey's End", since [[Saruman]] (Sharkey) died there. 

After the restoration the [[Gaffer Gamgee]] returned to Number 3, and his son [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] lived with him until Sam married [[Rose Cotton]] and relocated to Bag End.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
