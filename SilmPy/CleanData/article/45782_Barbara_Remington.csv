'''Barbara Remington''' is an American artist. She painted the cover art for [[Ballantine Books]]'s first paperback editions of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] expressed dislike.

On [[1 November]] [[1967]], she sent a letter to Tolkien, explaining that the publisher was trying to get the books out as fast as possible because of competition, which did not give her time to read the books.<ref name=CG>{{CG|C}}, p. 710</ref>
