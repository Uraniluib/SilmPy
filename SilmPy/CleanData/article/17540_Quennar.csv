'''Quennar''', surnamed '''Onótimo''', was a [[Lambengolmor|Loremaster]] of [[Aman]]. He wrote extensively about the reckoning of time among the [[Valar]]. His great work the ''[[Yénonótië]]'' was cited by [[Pengolodh]] in the ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]'', particularly his writing explaining the length of the [[Valian year]] and its relation to the waxing and waning of the [[Two Trees]]. Quennar also calculated the duration of Valian years compared to [[Years of the Sun]].<ref>{{WJ|V}}</ref> Aside from his work on reckoning that Pengolodh cited, and for devising the word ''[[Menel]]'' ("heavens, firmament"),<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 84</ref> almost nothing is known about Quennar's writings or his life in general.

==Etymology==
Quennar's first name seems to consist of the [[Quenya]] word for 'person', 'elf': ''[[quen]]'', and a derivative of the root NAR<sup>2</sup> 'tell',<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> yielding the meaning *"Elf-speaker". ''Onótimo'' apparently means "Reckoner", originating from the verb ''[[onot-]]'' 'count up' and the masculine agental suffix ''[[-mo]]''.<ref>{{VT|34}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally, "Quennar i Onótimo" was to have been the author of the ''Annals of Aman'' as a whole, having learned and borrowed much writing from [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]]. Eventually, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] attributed the ''Annals'' to Rúmil himself, while adding "quoth Pengolodh" to the end of the section ascribed to Quennar. This probably means that Pengolodh quoted Quennar's work in his enlargement of the ''Annals'', which presumably took place after the [[Exile of the Noldor]]. Since Quennar's writing discusses the [[Years of the Sun]], which did not exist while the [[Noldor]] still lived in Aman, it is most likely the case that in the final version of events as envisioned by Tolkien, Quennar wrote the ''[[Yénonótië]]'' after the Exile and was thus a Noldo who came to [[Middle-earth]].
