'''Almaida''' was a shoreland town that apparently lay on the [[Bay of Andúnië]] in the northwestern region of [[Númenor]] known as the [[Andustar]]. It seems to have been built a little further westward along the bay than the main city of [[Andúnië]] itself, but little more can be said of Almaida. 
==Etymology==
The name is only known from a single [[Númenórë (map)‎|sketch-map of Númenor]], where it is unintelligible, and is never mentioned elsewhere.<ref name=UT>{{UT|Introduction}}</ref> The name is apparently [[Quenya]] but also it is incompatible with Quenya phonology as the sound ''d'' does not occur in Quenya names outside "nd", "rd" and "ld".<ref group=note>A similar problem is seen with the word ''[[Aldudénië]]'' from the ''[[Silmarillion]]''</ref>. It has been suggested that the actual word was misread by [[Christopher Tolkien]].<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://elfling.midgardsmal.com/index.php?topic=103489.0|articlename=Númenor Place-Names|website=[http://elfling.midgardsmal.com Elfling]}}</ref>
