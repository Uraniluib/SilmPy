The '''Sirannon''', or '''Gate Stream''', was a stream in [[Eriador]].

==Course==
Beginning at the [[Celebdil|Silvertine]], it flowed past the [[Doors of Durin]], the gates of [[Moria]] (hence its name) to [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the old capital city of the [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]], where it joined the river [[Glanduin]]. Along the river, from Ost-in-Edhil to Moria, ran an ancient road.

The Sirannon dropped over the [[Stair Falls]] beyond the gates of Moria, and its sound was heard from miles around.<ref name="Dark">{{FR|II4}}</ref>

==History==
On [[13 January]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> (by which point both Moria and Eregion had long been abandoned), the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] found that the Sirannon had been dammed by someone or something, and before the gates of Moria there was now a foul lake. In this lake dwelt the [[Watcher in the Water]], who nearly caught the Ring-bearer [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name="Dark"/>

Moria was eventually resettled by [[Dwarves]] during the [[Fourth Age]], therefore the Sirannon was probably cleansed.

==Etymology==
The name obviously means "stream-gate".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 360</ref> The [[Westron]] name '''Gate-stream''' is its translation.
