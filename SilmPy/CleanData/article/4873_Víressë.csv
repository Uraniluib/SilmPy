'''Víressë''' was the name for the month of the year (''[[asta]]'') that followed the month [[Súlimë]] and preceded the month [[Lótessë]]. It was the fourth month in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]]; in the latter calendar, it was preceded by the feast-day of [[Tuilérë]]. After the introduction of [[New Reckoning]], Víressë became the first month.<ref name=app/>

''Víressë'' in the Kings' Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards' Reckoning) corresponded to [[Astron]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[23 March]] through [[21 April]]).

==Etymology==
This [[Quenya]] name is related to words such as ''[[virya]]'' "fresh" and perhaps derives from an [[Elvish]] root having to do with freshness or youth.<ref name=arda>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|website=Arda}}</ref> Víressë was the [[Quenya]] name inherited from [[Númenor]] and traditionally used by the [[Westron]]-speaking peoples. The [[Dúnedain]] themselves however used the [[Sindarin]] name of the month, [[Gwirith]].<ref name=app>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
As the Númenorean calendars seem to be based on the [[Wikipedia:French Republican Calendar|French Republican Calendar]], the name and meaning of the month corresponds to the month [[Wikipedia:Germinal_(French_Republican_Calendar)|Germinal]], meaning "seed-time".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Elvish loanwords in Indo-European, p. 151</ref>
