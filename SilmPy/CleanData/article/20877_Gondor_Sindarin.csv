'''Gondor Sindarin'''<ref name="PE17100">{{PE|Eldarin}}, page 100</ref> was a dialect of [[Sindarin|the Elven language]] spoken by the [[Gondorians|Men]] of [[Gondor]]. 

==Differences==
[[Westron]] was the first language of Gondor. The nobility usually learned Sindarin, and used it to be polite to other nobles and strangers alike.<ref name="L347">{{L|347}}</ref> Although an ancient form of Sindarin was taught in school (and regarded in high esteem), its daily use corrupted it in comparison to the Sindarin as spoken by the [[Elves]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}, Note #74</ref> Because it was both an acquired and a learned language, it had some notable differences with "regular" [[Third Age]] Sindarin. 
===Phonetical===
Like any acquired language, the second language's sound range is directly influenced by the speaker's original sound range. Westron did not possess ''ch''<ref name="CE49">{{UT|Cirion}}, note 49</ref> or ''y'',<ref name="AppE"/> and pronounced them differently.

The ''y'' was pronounced by Sindarin Elves as [[wikipedia:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [y], a [[wikipedia:Close front rounded vowel|close front rounded vowel]]. Of all languages, only Sindarin had this sound, so it was problematic for speakers of other tongues. Gondorians generally pronounced it as an ''i'',<ref name="AppE">{{App|Vowels}}</ref> though it was sometimes substituted with an ''e'', as in the Gondorian plural for ''[[onod]]'', ''ened'' (rather than the usual ''enyd'').<ref name="L144">{{L|144}}</ref>

Also frequent in Sindarin was the ''ch'', the [[wikipedia:velar fricative|velar fricative]], which the Gondorians also encountered among [[pre-Númenórean]] placenames such as [[Erech]]<ref name="L297">{{L|297}}</ref> and [[Eilenach]].<ref name="CE51">{{UT|Cirion}}, note 51</ref>

The most notable use of the voiceless velar fricative was in the name of Gondor's new northern neighbour, [[Rohan]]. Originally envisioned as ''Rochand'', in Gondor this became ''Rohan''. Though [[Rohirric|the tongue of the Éothéod]] did possess the voiced ''ch'', it adopted the southern use.<ref name="CE49"/> The voiced velar fricative, found in ''Rochand'', was pronounced as a sounded ''h'',<ref name="L144"/> while the voiceless variant, at the end of words, was pronounced as a ''k''. Those very learned would pronounced them correct, but forcibly so.<ref name="CE49"/>

===Philological===
Another notable difference from regular Sindarin was purely [[wikipedia:Philology|philological]]. Those Gondorians learned in lore wished to speak like [[Noldor]], and the Sindarin they spoke in the [[First Age]] was [[North Sindarin]]. At least one feature from North Sindarin was reintroduced: whereas "true Sindarin of the Elves" changed both the voiced and voiceless combination of a [[wikipedia:sonorant|sonorant consonant]] and a [[wikipedia:Fricative consonant|spirant]] to a long sonorant, the Gondor Sindarin retained the spirant. Thus in the case of the former, ''[[malt]]'' ("gold") and ''[[orn]]'' ("tree") became ''[[Mallorn]]'', in Gondor this remained ''Malthorn''.<ref name="VT4227">{{VT|42a}}, pages 5-31, esp. 27</ref><ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], ''[http://www.elvish.org/Tengwestie/articles/Hostetter/sindll.phtml The Two Phonetic Values of ''ll'' in Elvish Sindarin in ''The Lord of the Rings'']'', published on [http://www.elvish.org/Tengwestie/ Tengwestië], [[7 December|December 7]], [[2003]]</ref>
