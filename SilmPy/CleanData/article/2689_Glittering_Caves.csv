The '''Glittering Caves''', also called '''Aglarond''', were the spectacular jewelled caverns that lay in the [[White Mountains]] behind [[Helm's Deep]] in [[Rohan]]. 

==Overview==
The Glittering Caves were located behind [[Helm's Deep]] under the three peaks of the [[Thrihyrne]] in the northwestern arm of the [[White Mountains]]. The Glittering Caves extended deep under the mountains, with many passages, stairs, halls, and chambers. The floors were sandy and the ceilings were high, domed vaults. The walls were polished stone set with gems and crystals and veins of ore.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

The entrance to the caves was behind the [[Deeping Wall]] in a narrow gorge that could be defended long against an onslaught, making them an ideal refuge location.

[[Gimli]] called the Glittering Caves one of the marvels of the Northern World. Reportedly, Legolas was left speechless after visiting them, one of the few times that a dwarf has bested an elf with words. 

==History==
Aglarond was explored during the [[Second Age]] by [[Númenóreans]], although it is unclear exactly when and by whom.<ref>{{S|V}},p. 291</ref> Later, after the founding of [[Rohan]] it was used as a storage space and refuge for [[Rohirrim]] who used the [[Hornburg]].

===War of the Ring===
During the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] on [[3 March|3]]-[[4 March]], {{TA|3019}}, many of the women, children, and elderly people of the [[Westfold]] took refuge in the Glittering Caves. Livestock and food were stored there as well. 

Some [[Orcs]] crept through a culvert in the Deeping Wall and entered the gorge but were killed or driven back by the defenders. Then the Deeping Wall was breached by an explosive device and the Enemy forces entered the Deep. Many of the [[Rohirrim]] including [[Éomer]] were driven back to the Glittering Caves, and with them was Gimli.<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>

After the war Gimli brought [[Legolas]] to see the caves; the Elf was so impressed that he was silent and said that only Gimli could fittingly describe them.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

===As a Dwarven colony===
When [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] was held up in the caves, he was amazed by their beauty. After the [[War of the Ring]] he brought from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] part of [[Durin's Folk]] and founded a [[Dwarf realms|colony]] in the caves, becoming the first [[Lord of the Glittering Caves]]. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves carefully tended the stone walls and opened new ways and chambers and hung lamps that filled the caverns with light.<ref>{{TT|Road}}</ref> The Glittering Caves became one of the most important realms of the [[Dwarves]] at the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Aglarond'' is [[Sindarin]] and contains the elements [[aglar]]+[[rond]], therefore "caves of glory". However since the word ''aglar'' is related to ''light'', the [[Westron]] "Glittering Caves" can be the exact translation.

The Rohirrim called them ''[[Glǽmscrafu]]''<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref> or '''Caverns of Helm's Deep'''.

==Inspiration==
The Glittering Caves are one of very few locations in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s work that are associated with a real place. They were inspired by the [[wikipedia:Cheddar Gorge and Caves|Cheddar Gorge]] in [[wikipedia:Somerset|Somerset]].<ref>{{L|321}}</ref>
