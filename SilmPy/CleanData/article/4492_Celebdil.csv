'''Celebdil''', also known as '''Silvertine''' and '''Zirakzigil''', was one of the three peaks that stood above the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. The other two were [[Caradhras]] (''Redhorn'') and [[Fanuidhol]] (''Cloudyhead'').

Celebdil was the southernmost of the [[Mountains of Moria]] and the [[Endless Stair]] led from the deepest halls of Khazad-dûm up to [[Durin's Tower]] on the peak of the mountain. There the final battle between [[Gandalf]] and [[Durin's Bane]] took place.<ref name="White Rider">{{HM|TT}}, "[[The White Rider]]"</ref>
