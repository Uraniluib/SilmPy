'''Rhudaur''' was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the break-up of [[Arnor]] ({{TA|861}}). The other kingdoms were [[Arthedain]] and [[Cardolan]].

==Location==
Rhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and stretched from the Weather Hills with [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]] to the river [[Bruinen]]. It reached to the [[Ettenmoors]]. It shared a long border with Cardolan along the [[East Road]], and with Arthedain along the line of the Weather Hills.

The land between the rivers [[Mitheithel]] and Bruinen, forming the [[Angle (Eriador)|The Angle]], was also considered part of Rhudaur.<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==History==
From the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two other successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with Cardolan over the tower of Amon Sûl and the ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]'' associated with the tower.

The first [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[Hobbits]] came into [[Eriador]] around {{TA|1150|n}}. However, due to the increasing hostility of [[Angmar]] these Stoors fled the region around {{TA|1356|n}}, with some of them moving west to Arthedain, and others moving back to the [[Vales of Anduin]].

The last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were descended of [[Hill-men]]; by the time of [[Argeleb I]] of Arnor, Rhudaur was ruled by an evil lord who secretly was in league with [[Angmar]], and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain. Argeleb died fighting Rhudaur and Angmar.<ref name=eriador/>

Angmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in {{TA|1409|n}}. By this time the Númenóreans were gone from the region, as well as most of the other inhabitants.<ref name=eriador/>

There is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the [[Battle of Fornost]] the Angle became home to the remainder of the [[Dúnedain]], and the [[Rangers of the North]] established several villages there,{{fact}} where their people lived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] at the end of the Third Age.

==Etymology==
The name ''Rhudaur'' is translated by Tolkien as "Troll shaw" (''[[rhû]]'' "evil, wicked" and ''[[taur]]'', "forest").<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 115, 170</ref> It is unknown whether it is intended to be the same as [[Trollshaws]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==

:[[Galadriel]] mentions the [[High Fells of Rhudaur]] as the place where the [[Witch-king]] was buried following the fall of [[Angmar]].

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:[[Gandalf]] and [[Radagast]] travel to the High Fells to examine the whereabouts of [[Nazgûl]], only to discover that they have all escaped.
