==Production==
''The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers'' followed the first part, ''[[The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 computer game)|The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]]''<ref name="Tolkien Games"/> and chronicles the events of [[The Two Towers|the second tome]].<ref name="El Anillo"/> A third game was originally also planned, covering ''[[The Return of the King]]'', but it never came to be.<ref name="Tolkien Games"/>

The game was designed by [[Mark Whittlesey]] and [[Scott Bennie]],<ref name="Tolkien Games"/><ref name="IMDB"/> who chose to retain most of the story and also mixed in elements from [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s other works.<ref name="El Anillo"/>

==Gameplay==
The gameplay was copied from the first game,<ref name="El Anillo"/> but made considerably easier. Unlike its predecessor, there is no fixed character: several characters are playable,<ref name="Moby"/> each with a selection of weapons.

The game also featured an [[wikipedia:Automap|automapping]] system, and the scale was reduced to improve player orientation.
