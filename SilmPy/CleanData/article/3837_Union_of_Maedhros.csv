The '''Union of Maedhros''' was the short-lived alliance formed by [[Maedhros]] uniting the [[Sons of Fëanor]] with the other [[Noldor]] and [[Edain]] and other peoples of [[Beleriand]], after the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref name=Fifth>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
==Structure==
The Union was divided in two armies in the east and west, led Maedhros and [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Fingon]] respectively.

;Eastern army
*Elves of [[Himring]] ([[Maedhros]])
*[[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] under the service of Maedhros ([[Bór]])
*Easterlings under the service of [[Caranthir]] ([[Ulfang]])
*[[Dwarves of Belegost]] ([[Azaghâl]])

;Western army
*Noldor of [[Hithlum]] ([[Fingon]])
*[[Men of Dor-lómin|Edain]] of [[Dor-lómin]] ([[Húrin]] and [[Huor]])
*[[Men of Brethil|Edain]] of [[Brethil]] ([[Haldir_(Chieftain_of_the_Haladin)|Haldir]])
*[[Elves of Nargothrond|Elves]] of [[Nargothrond]] ([[Gwindor]])
*Some [[Falathrim]]
*[[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]] from [[Doriath]]

==History==
After the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the [[Noldor]] had lost control over the northern [[Beleriand]], and were mostly reduced to enclaves in [[Hithlum]] and [[Nargothrond]], including the hidden [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> When Maedhros heard of the heroic deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] new hope came to him. Maedhros decided to unite the peoples of [[Beleriand]] to assail [[Angband]].

Elves, Men and Dwarves joined the alliance. The [[Dwarves]] of the [[Blue Mountains]] supplied both armed forces and forged weapons. Even to [[Gondolin]] came word of the Union and [[Turgon]] the [[Hidden King]] secretly made his own preparations. Other Elves, like [[Orodreth]], refused to join because of the evils of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], while [[Thingol]] had sworn never to fight alongside the Feanorians; only a few representatives came from Doriath and Nargothrond. 

Maedhros' plans were to lead his army (with some assistance from the western army) to [[Anfauglith]] in order to draw out the armies of Morgoth, and then flank with the hidden forces of Fingon that would emerge from the [[Ered Wethrin]].

Initially the forces managed to clean of evil creatures [[West Beleriand]] and [[Dorthonion]], and the final assault was planned for [[Midsummer]]. However Morgoth had time to prepare his forces as Maedhros revealed himself too early, and then [[Uldor]], who was an agent of the Enemy, delayed Maedhros' forces by giving false reports of enemy presence. A small force of [[Orcs]] managed to provoke the western army prematurely, instigated by [[Gwindor]]. As a result, the armies of the Union were themselves outflanked in the ensuing battle, which, despite Turgon's timely and unexpected arrival, would prove disastrous, and would be known as the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref name=Fifth/>
