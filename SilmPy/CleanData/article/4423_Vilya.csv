'''Vilya''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈviʎa]}}) or '''Wilya''' (pre-[[Second Age|SA]] and [[Vanyarin]], {{IPA|[ˈwiʎa]}}), as a proper noun, was one of the [[Rings of Power]] made by the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]].  Vilya, [[Nenya]], and [[Narya]] were the [[Three Rings|Three Rings of the Elves]], more powerful than the rings given to [[Dwarves]] or [[Men]].  Like the other Elven Rings, Vilya was jeweled: it contained a great blue stone set in a gold band, which contributed to its titles as the '''Ring of Sapphire''' and the '''Blue Ring'''.  A lesser-used title of Vilya was the '''Ring of Air''', signifying its pre-eminence even over the other Rings of the Elves; it was generally considered that Vilya was the mightiest of these three bands.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

==History==
By {{SA|1590}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> [[Celebrimbor]], the lord of [[Eregion]], had forged all Three Rings independently of [[Annatar]], a guise of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]].  As a result, none of the Three were stained by his evil.  However, like all the Rings of the Elves, Vilya was still under Sauron's influence when he wielded [[The One Ring]], which held dominion over all the others.

When Sauron made his Ring in {{SA|1600}}, Celebrimbor became aware of his designs and in {{SA|1603|n}} gave the Three Rings to Elven guardians,<ref name="SA"/> with Vilya sent to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]].  Sauron waged war against the Elves in [[Eriador]] but was eventually defeated.  Afterwards, Gil-Galad gave Vilya to [[Elrond]],<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> who bore it through the later years of the [[Second Age]] and all of the [[Third Age|Third]].

Upon Sauron's destruction in {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the power of Vilya faded and it went over the sea along with Elrond at the end of the Third Age.<ref name="Grey"/>

==Quenya Noun==
'''''vilya''''', when not referring to the Ring of Air, is a noun meaning "air" or "sky" in [[Quenya]].<ref name="Names">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref>

==Tengwa==
[[Image:Vilya.gif|left]]''Vilya'' is also the name in Quenya of the twenty-fourth letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.<ref name="Names"/>  It is the fourth letter of the sixth grade or [[Tyellë]], which contains "semi-vocalic" consonants and it is the sixth letter in the fourth series of consonants.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>  In early written Quenya this letter represented '''W''' when the letter was called ''Wilya''.  Over time this letter ceased to have a clear function.  However, in the [[Mode of Beleriand]] (as seen in the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] of [[Moria]] inscription) ''Vilya'' is used for a following '''W''' in the diphthong ''iw''.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  The [[Westron]] name for this letter is ''''''Á'''''.<ref>See [[Westron Tengwar]].</ref>

==Etymology==
The word derives from the [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[WIL]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, WIL-</ref>
