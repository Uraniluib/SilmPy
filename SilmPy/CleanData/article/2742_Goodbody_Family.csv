The '''Goodbody Family''' was one of the many prominent families that lived in [[the Shire]], perhaps of the upper class.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 171</ref> The Goodbodies were connected to the [[Baggins Family]] through [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s great aunt [[Lily Baggins|Lily]], who married one [[Togo Goodbody]].<ref name="Baggins">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> They were also connected to the [[Bolger Family]]; [[Cora Goodbody]] married [[Rudolph Bolger]].<ref>{{App|Bolger}}</ref>

Among the [[Baggins Family#Baggins Of Hobbiton - Family Tree|family trees]] in [[Appendix C]] to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', their descendants are summed up in just two words: 'Various Goodbodies'.<ref name="Baggins"/> Bilbo acknowledged the connection at his famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]]: we know that at least some of the various Goodbodies were present at that feast.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The Goodbodies were added as guests to Bilbo's Farewell Party in the fifth draft of the first chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  However, at that time the family name was ''Gawkroger'',<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref> a Yorkshire surname meaning "clumsy Roger".<ref>{{RS|2XIVN}}, note 10</ref>
