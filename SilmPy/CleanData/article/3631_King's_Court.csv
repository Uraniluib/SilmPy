'''King's Court''' referred to the courts of the [[King of Númenor|Kings of Númenor]] in [[Armenelos]], where grew the [[Nimloth of Númenor|White Tree, Nimloth]].<ref>{{App|D2}}</ref>

After [[Sauron]] had been taken to [[Númenor]] and began to acquire power over [[Ar-Pharazôn]], he urged the king to cut down Nimloth.  When [[Isildur]] heard of Sauron's purpose he entered the King's Court one night, alone and in disguise, and took a fruit from the tree.  Isildur had to fight his way out of the court; afterwards the king yielded to Sauron and had the tree felled.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
