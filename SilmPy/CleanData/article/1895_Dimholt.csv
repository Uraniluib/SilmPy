'''Dimholt''', was a small fir-wood of dark trees within [[Dunharrow]], outside the entrance to the [[Dark Door]]. 

The Dimholt was traversed by a double row of standing stones that marked an ancient roadway leading away into the east, towards the [[Dwimorberg]] and the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Deep within a wood of black trees stood a single great stone to mark the way, and beyond that, among the roots of the Dwimorberg, lay the Dark Door of [[Oathbreakers|The Dead]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The word is supposed to be [[Rohirric]] and the element ''dim'' has the archaic sense "obscure, secret". ''Holt'' means "wood" in occasional poetic use (also seen in the name ''[[Everholt]]''), with a cognate in German "Holz" meaning 'wood, lumber'.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 768</ref>
