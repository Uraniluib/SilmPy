This military leader of the [[Éothéod]] served under [[Lord of the Éothéod|Lord]] [[Forthwini]].

He aided the [[Gondorians]] against the [[Wainriders]] in the summer of {{TA|1944}}.

During the battle, he rode to the rescue of a party of Éothéod as they retreated to­wards the [[Dead Marshes]]. A soldier died in his arms. After he searched his body he found out that the dead soldier was [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]], the Prince of Gondor. 

The Leader went to join [[Minohtar]] at the head of the [[North Road]] in [[Ithilien]].  Minohtar was preparing a message to be taken to the prince when he learned the news that the prince had been killed in battle.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>
==Name==
The name of that leader is unknown. [[Christopher Tolkien]] says that the first part of his name is "Marh-" but the rest is illegible.

Marh- is a [[Gothic]] name element meaning "horse" (see also [[Marhari]], [[Marhwini]]).
