__NOTOC__
'''''-nd''''' is a toponymical ending in [[Sindarin]], an ending "commonly used in the names of regions or countries". Vowels could be attached to the ending, yielding the forms ''-and'', ''-end'', ''-ond''. In names such as ''[[Rohan]]'', the ''-d'' was dropped, due to its lack of pronunciation in speech (this also occurred in ''[[Anorien]]'' and ''[[Ithilien]]).<ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 248</ref>

The form also appears as ''-ian(d)'', ''-iann'', ''-ion'', ''-ien''.<ref name="PE">{{PE|17}}, pp. 42-3, 115</ref>

==Examples==
===With ''a''===
*[[Beleriand]]
*[[Ossiriand]]
*[[Calacirian]]/Kalakiryandë (from [[Calacirya]])
*[[Cardolan]]
*[[Rohan]]

===With ''e''===
*[[Hildórien]] (note that [[Hildor]] is a [[Quenya]] name)
*[[Arthórien]]
*[[Arvernien]]
*[[Lothlorien]]
*[[Ithilien]]
*[[Anorien]]

===With ''o''===
*[[Dorthonion]]
*[[Dorwinion]]
*[[Region]]
*[[Lindon]]
*[[Eregion]]
*[[Calenardhon]]

==Etymology==
''-ian(d)'' and ultimately ''-ien'' are reduced from ''-iand(a)'', ''-iend(e)'',<ref>{{PE|17}} p.37</ref> and said to be derived from [[PQ]] ''[[yandē]]'' "a wide region, or country".<ref name="PE"/>

''-(i)on'' appears in later-formed names and is in origin distinct from the above. It is explained to be from root [[YAN]]A- and/or root YONO.<ref name="PE"/>
==Cognates==
Relevant endings don't appear in other languages such as [[Quenya]] save perhaps the name [[Hildórien]] and [[Calacirian]] (from ''Kalakiryande'')<ref name=RGEO>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 70</ref>. However there is the [[Qenya]] name ''Valariande''<ref>{{HM|LT1}} p.202</ref> and ''Ossiriande''.<ref>{{LB|C1}}, pp. 158-9</ref> The book ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'' gives the Quenya name of Lothlórien as ''[[Lóriende]]''.

The above hint that in Quenya the endings were preserved as ''-iande'' and ''-iende'', without loss of final ''-e''. On the other hand, ''Valariande'' is perhaps non-canon as early Qenya (but consistent to the later rules of phonology); as for ''Lóriende'', it seems to be constructed after the Sindarin name and can not be indicative of Quenya etymology.{{fact}}
