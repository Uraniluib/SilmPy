'''The Watcher in the Water''' was a mysterious and horrific beast that lurked in a lake caused by the damming of the [[Sirannon]] river, beneath the western [[walls of Moria]]. The full shape of the creature is unknown; its visible parts were its tentacles, which were long, sinuous, pale-green, and luminous, with a fingered end.<ref name=Dark>{{FR|II4}}</ref> There is very little known about the creature. Even [[Gandalf]] did not know what the Watcher was, or whether there were many of its kind.

==History==
In {{TA|2989}} an expedition led by [[Balin]] attempted to reclaim Moria. Their activity attracted the attention of Orcs, who began to attack the Dwarves. In {{TA|2994|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the Dwarves tried to escape from the mines but were stopped by the Watcher, who killed [[Óin]]. When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] found the [[Book of Mazarbul]] they read that "...the pool is up to the wall at [[Doors of Durin|Westgate]]. '''The Watcher in the Water''' took [[Óin]]. We cannot get out."<ref name=Dark/>

On [[13 January]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the Watcher attacked the Fellowship just as they had opened the Doors of Durin to enter Moria. It grasped [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] by the foot and attempted to drag him into the water. [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] slashed the arm holding Frodo, causing it to release him. The party retreated through the doorway, followed by several tentacles. The creature possessed great strength; after the escape of the Fellowship into Moria, the arms hurled the enormous stone doors shut and uprooted the trees which grew to either side, barring the doors. Silently Gandalf noted that it seized Frodo (as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]) first<ref name=Dark/> suggesting an influence by [[the One Ring]].

It is unknown what happened to the Watcher in the following centuries, but the Dwarves succeeded in retaking [[Moria]] in the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Watcher is a green, multi-tentacled monster. Only the tentacles can be seen. It takes [[Bill the Pony]] and pulls the [[Doors of Durin]] shut once the Fellowship is inside the mountains.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Watcher in the Water.jpg|The Watcher in the Water in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''|right|thumb|150px]]
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:The Watcher in the Water was made to be slightly different than that in the [[The Fellowship of the Ring|book]]. In the book only green slightly luminous tentacles appear. In this film not only the tentacles but a massive head is visible. The tentacles of the Watcher in the Water have a sort of thumb and flat hand. In addition, there is a big sack on the back of the head that fills with air, making it look twice as big. In full form it resembles an octopus with a humanoid face. It has massive teeth in a small mouth, and great eyes set across from each other.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Watcher is depicted as a sea serpent-like creature, with several thick tentacles that shoot out of the pool. The player, in the persona of Aragorn, needs to shoot them with a bow to stun the Watcher while Gandalf attempts to decipher the password for the West-gate.

'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]: [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'':'''
:The Watcher in the Water first features in the Moria introduction, where it drove off the [[Dwarves]] of the Iron Garrison in their first attempt to enter [[Moria]]. The need to find a weapon capable of harming it which serves to introduce the player to the expansion pack's new Legendary Item system. After being driven out of the Black Pool before the [[Doors of Durin]], it is encountered and driven off again in the Water-Works of Moria later in the Epic series. Its final appearance was in a twelve-man raid in which the objective is to finally put an end to the creature.
