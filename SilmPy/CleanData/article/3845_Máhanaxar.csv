'''Máhanaxar''', also called '''Rithil-Anamo'''<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}} p. 401</ref>, was the '''Ring of Doom''', probably a hall or court where the [[Valar]] held their councils.

The Ring was outside the golden western gates of the city of [[Valmar]], not far from the hill [[Ezellohar]], with the thrones of the Valar arranged in circle.<ref name=s1/>

The Valar were sitting on their thrones while watching [[Yavanna]] chanting, bringing the [[Two Trees]] to life upon Ezellohar.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> Ever after, the Powers sat bathed in the light of the Trees to hold their great councils, and here some of the most momentous decisions of [[Eä]]'s history were made.
==Etymology==
The name is how the [[Amanyar]] called the Ring of Doom in [[Quenya]]. It contains the word ''[[Máhan]]'' "chief Vala".<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}} p. 402</ref>.

All in all, it is said to be derived from [[Valarin]] '''''Mâchananaškad'''''.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 399</ref>
