'''Eastfold''' was a part of the realm of [[Rohan]]. Laying between the [[White Mountains]] and [[Entwash]], it was bounded by the [[Mering Stream]] at the east and [[Snowbourn]] River at the west.

The whole area was traversed by the [[Great West Road]] parallel to the Mountain range. Locations of the Eastfold included the [[Folde]] to the west, with the capital city of [[Edoras]] nearby, and the [[Fenmark]], being the south-eastern borders of Rohan. To the east laid [[Anórien]] of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

A similar name, the '''East Dales''', are mentioned when it is told how the [[Rohirrim]] who had fallen in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] were buried in two mounds; "those of the [[Westfold]] in one and those from the East Dales in another."<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref> It has been suggested that the name is obviously a synonym for Eastfold.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pg. 419</ref>
