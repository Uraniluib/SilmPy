__NOTOC__
'''RUSKĀ''' is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] given no signification, except from what can be determined from its derivatives.<ref name=Ety>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 385 (root appearing as "RUSKĀ-")</ref>

==Derivatives==
*[[Kornoldorin|Old Noldorin]]: ''[[ruska]]'' ("brown")<ref name=Ety/> > [[Noldorin]]: ''[[rhosc]]'' ("brown")<ref name=Ety/>
*[[Quenya]]: ''[[rusco]]'' ("fox")<ref>{{VT|41}}</ref>
==Other etymologies==
The related [[Quenya]] words ''[[russa]]'' "red-haired" and ''[[russe]]'' "(a head or pelt of) red hair" show derivation from another, more basic root *RUS, of which RUSKĀ is obviously an extended form.
==Inspiration==
Tolkien translates the Quenya word ''russa'' as "[[Wikipedia:Russet_(color)|russet]]"<ref>{{HM|PM}} pp.353-354</ref>. The English word ''russet'' derives from Latin ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/russus russus]'' "reddish".

There is a possibility that the similarities of both form and sense between the Elvish root and English/Latin words is intentional.
