==Summary==
Tolkien said he was honoured by Thurston's letter and was willing that she should use [[Rivendell]] as a herd prefix, although he claimed he did not know if the actual valley would have been suitable for herd breeding.  Tolkien expressed interest in names she would chose for the bulls and offered to chose or create names if she wished.  The [[Elvish]] word for "bull" was [[Mundo|MUNDO]].<ref group="note">Tolkien supplied Mrs. Thurston with cattle names in [[Letter 345]].</ref>
