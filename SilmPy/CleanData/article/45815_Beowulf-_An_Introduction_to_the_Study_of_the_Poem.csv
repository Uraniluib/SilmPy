'''''Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the Stories of Offa and Finn''''' is a 1921 book by [[R.W. Chambers]] about ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''.

By [[28 July]] [[1922]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had agreed to review this book for G.N. Clark, editor of the ''English Historical Review''. He made [[Index:Unpublished material|several pages of notes]], but would not complete the review (or perhaps it was never published).<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]], [[Wayne G.
