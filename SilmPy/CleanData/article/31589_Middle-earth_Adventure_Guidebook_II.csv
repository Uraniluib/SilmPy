== Cover/Jacket Text == 

In a fantasy role playing game, you become a main character in an adventure you create. This adventure guide helps you capture the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, world of THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Converse with the Elves in their own language! In this volume, an Elvish Dictionary provides pronunciation and grammar guidelines for the Eldarin tongues, Sindarin and Quenya. Listed translations of Elvish and English words and phrases let you decipher the silver speech of Elven Lords and create authentic names for the Eldar and their enchanted sites. A Glossary of Terms lists Middle-earth definitions, identities, and places in an accessible index. Your campaign comes alive with the secrets of the Ainur, the whereabouts of Hild√≥rien and the lineage of Thranduil - all at your fingertips! A new, poster-size map brings you Middle-earth in full detail and color - unfold and find yourself in the land of Elves and Wizards!
