The '''''Atanatárion''''' refers to three Great Tales recorded by the [[Númenóreans]] that concern heroes of the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]].  These tales, preserved in [[Gondor]], were:

*''Narn [[Beren]] ion [[Barahir]]'' (Tale of Beren son of Barahir) or ''Narn e-Dinúviel'' (Tale of the Nightingale)
*''[[Narn i Hîn Húrin|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' (Tale of the Children of Húrin) or ''Narn e-'Rach Morgoth'' (Tale of the Curse of Morgoth), and
*''Narn en El'' (Tale of the [[Star of Earendil|Star]]) or ''Narn e-Dant [[Gondolin]] ar Orthad en El'' (Tale of [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]] and the Rise of the Star)

The latter two comprise the wider matter ''Narn e-mbar Hador'' (Tale of the [[House of Hador]]).<ref>{{MR|P5I}}</ref>

Judging from their titles, the works were apparently composed in [[Sindarin]]. 

==Etymology==
The title means '''(Legendarium) of the [[Atanatári|Fathers of Men]]''' and is the genitive of ''[[Atanatári]]''. The [[Sindarin]] title is ''Nern in Edenedair/Adanath''.

==Inspiration==
[[Tolkien]] wrote about the ''Atanatárion'' and the titles of the three Great Tales on a small slip with the heading: ''Memorandum''. He probably considered composing them in the form of three short stories as Appendices to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (in which case the ''Tale of the Children of Húrin'' would be rendered much shorter than the published ''[[The Children of Húrin|Children of Húrin]]'').
