The '''Attack on Dol Guldur''' was an expedition launched by the [[White Council]] in {{TA|2941}} against the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] in southern [[Mirkwood]].

==History==
===Prelude===
When Sauron re-emerged, he established Dol Guldur on [[Amon Lanc]] after {{TA|1000}}. His corrupting [[shadow]] was only known as the "Necromancer", and as a result [[Thranduil]] led his people away. The Council of the Wise long feared the Necromancer might indeed be Sauron; [[Gandalf]] himself had entered Dol Guldur a couple of times, finally confirming that Sauron was its master. At first [[Saruman]] opposed the idea of an attack as he was searching for [[the One Ring]] in the area by then, but later, fearing that Sauron was also looking of the Ring, he finally agreed to an attack in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref>

===The Battle===
Gandalf carefully planned the attack to occur at the same time as the [[Quest of Erebor]], knowing that Sauron and [[Smaug]] could not assist each other.{{fact}} After leaving [[Thorin and Company]] at the outskirts of [[Mirkwood]],<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> he joined the White Council and they marched against the great fortress. 

Of the actual battle not much can be said (if this was simply a duel between great powers, or if it involved the use of armies of any kind). Thanks to the devices of Saruman, the Wise, Sauron was driven out from Dol Guldur,<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>however Sauron, having already made his plans, fled to his ancient realm of [[Mordor]].<ref name=TA/>

===Aftermath===
With victory theirs, Gandalf immediately left for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], where he would take part in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> After these events, Gandalf and Elrond dicussed their victories and agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>

However Dol Guldur was not destroyed; it remained standing, staffed by the [[Witch-king|lieutenant of Barad-dûr]], and later [[Khamûl]].<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, note 1, p. 352</ref> It was not before the [[War of the Ring]] when the fortress was finally [[Fall of Dol Guldur|destroyed]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:The Attack on Dol Guldur appears in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' as a secondary plot thread. [[Gandalf]], who had been imprisoned by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] at the end of [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|the second film]], is rescued by [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]] and [[Saruman]]. The three of them defeat the [[Nazgûl]] and Galadriel uses [[Phial of Galadriel|her phial]] to challenge Sauron; he flees to [[Mordor|the east]].
