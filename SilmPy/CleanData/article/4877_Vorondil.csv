}}'''Vorondil''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1919|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 204</ref> – {{TA|2029|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 110 years) was the second of three [[Stewards]] of [[Gondor]] that served King [[Eärnil II]]. 
==History==
Upon the death of his father, [[Pelendur]], the Stewardship of Gondor became hereditary within the [[House of Húrin]] and thus Vorondil succeeded to the position.<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Early in Vorondil's Stewardship Gondor was attacked and suffered a serious defeat. In {{TA|2000}}, the [[Nazgûl]] issued from [[Mordor]] to besiege [[Minas Ithil]].  The city fell in {{TA|2002|n}} and with it they took the ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]'' therein.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Vorondil was remembered as "Vorondil the Hunter" for his hunting of the [[Kine of Araw]], found near the shores of the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>  From one of the wild white oxen he fashioned a [[Great Horn]], bound with silver and written with characters.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref> It had been passed to the eldest son for generations within the House of Húrin and [[Boromir]] was the last to carry this horn.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

Vorondil was succeeded by his son [[Mardil]], who would become the first of the [[Ruling Steward]]s.<ref name="Stewards"/>
