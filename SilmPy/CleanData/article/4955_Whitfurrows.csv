'''Whitfurrows''' was a village or small town that lay in the [[Eastfarthing]], on the [[East Road]] through [[the Shire]], approximately midway between [[Frogmorton]] (about ten miles to the west) and the [[Brandywine Bridge]] (a similar distance to the east). It lay at the western edge of the [[Bridgefields]] region of the [[Eastfarthing]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> 

Whitfurrows appear to have been a centre or staging-post of some kind for the [[Shirriffs]] during the [[War of the Ring]].
