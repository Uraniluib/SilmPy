==Summary==
Tolkien said that he had given every spare moment to the poems.<ref group="notes">This refers to the collection of sixteen poems titled ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''</ref>  He stated that he had lost all confidence in them, all judgement, and could not see them becoming a book unless [[Pauline Baynes]] was inspired by them (which he doubted).

The various items do not "collect", said Tolkien.  The only possible link was the fiction of coming from the [[The Shire|Shire]] from the period of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but it was an uneasy fit for some.  He had tried to make them fit better.  He had added a new ''Bombadil'' poem<ref group="notes">Number two in the series, "[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]"</ref> that would further "integrate" Tom into the period.  It also tickled what Tolkien called his pedantic fancy, echoing the Norse Niblung and taking a line straight from ''[[Ancrene Wisse and Hali Mei√∞had|The Ancrene Wisse]]''.

Tolkien thought some kind of forward might be required.  He sent a sample, not intended to be used, but amusing as a piece of ridiculous editorial fiction.  He hoped [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] would not be greatly disappointed.<ref group="notes">It seems that Rayner was not disappointed; ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' was published later that same year.</ref>
