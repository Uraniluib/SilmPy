'''Cold-drakes''' were dragons that could not breathe fire. [[Morgoth]] bred and used cold-drakes in [[First Age]]. After the [[War of Wrath]], some cold-drakes were found in the [[Northern Waste|waste]] north of the the [[Grey Mountains]].

As the millennia passed, their numbers grew, until they became a serious threat in the later centuries of the [[Third Age]] to the [[Dwarves]] that mined the Grey Mountains.<ref name="AppA">{{App|Durin}}</ref> In {{TA|2589}}, [[Dáin I]], [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]], and his second son [[Frór]] were slain at the gates of their [[Dáin's halls|halls]] by a Cold-drake.<ref name="AppA" /> The attacks of these fearsome creatures persuaded the Dwarves to migrate eastwards from the Grey Mountains, and it was soon afterward that their [[Dwarf realms|realms]] in the [[Iron Hills]] and at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] were established.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Speaking about dragons, [[Thranduil]] tells to [[Thorin]] that he knows dragonfire, as in the past he has fought "the serpents of the North". Saying this, his cheek decomposes, as if some old wound is returning. This is erroneous, as Cold-drakes do not breathe fire.

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Cold-drakes appear throughout the northern lands of [[Middle-earth]], particularly in the [[Ered Mithrin]] where they serve "Hrímil Frost-Heart", a dragon who consumed one of the dwarven [[Rings of Power]]. Hrímil's mightiest spawn, the Cold-drake "Vethúg Wintermind", was the one to slay King [[Dáin I]] and his son [[Frór]] in Thikil-gundu, "The Steel Keep" (otherwise known as [[Dáin's Halls]]).
