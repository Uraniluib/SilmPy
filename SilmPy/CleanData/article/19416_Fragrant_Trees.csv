The '''Fragrant Trees''' were those species of trees which grew in [[Nísimaldar]], a western region in the Island of [[Númenor]]. The name derived from the sweet scent which came from their leaves, their flowers and even their bark. They were brought from [[Tol Eressëa| Eressëa]] by the [[Elves]] who navigated towards Númenor. Later, they were planted in other regions of the island, though they did not grow in such high numbers.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>

The Fragrant Trees were: [[Oiolairë]], [[Lairelossë]], [[Nessamelda]], [[Vardarianna]], [[Taniquelassë]], [[Yavannamírë]] and [[Malinornë]].
