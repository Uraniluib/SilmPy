'''Eryn Lasgalen''' or '''Wood of Greenleaves''' was the new name chosen by [[Celeborn]] and [[Thranduil]] for the forest that had been known as [[Mirkwood]] for much of the [[Third Age]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

Its name is almost the same as the pre-Mirkwood name [[Mirkwood|Eryn Galen]] ("[[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]"),<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> but with the addition of the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[las]]'' ("leaf").
