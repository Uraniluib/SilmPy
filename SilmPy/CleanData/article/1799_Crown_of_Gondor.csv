The '''Crown of Gondor''', also called the '''winged crown'''<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>, '''White Crown''', '''Silver Crown''' and the '''crown of [[Elendil]]''',<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> was the ceremonial headgear of the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] of [[Gondor]], and was used as a symbol of the Kingship.  
==Description==
It is said that the original crown was a plain [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] war-helm.<ref name=Eriador/> However a later crown replaced it, described as a tall, jeweled and winged helm, not unlike the helms of the [[Guards of the Citadel]], but taller and all white, with wings resembling those of a sea-bird wrought of pearl and silver. Seven gems of adamant were set in the circlet. On its summit was a jewel, the light of which went up like a flame to represent Anarion.<ref name="Steward">{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Matěj Čadil - Meneldil of Gondor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Meneldil]], the first King of Gondor after Isildur]]
The original crown of Gondor was said to be a plain Númenórean war-helm, the one worn by the Númenórean Kings in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]; as [[Anárion]]'s helm was crushed when he was killed, the war-helm of [[Isildur]] was used for the crowning of the Kings of Gondor.<ref name=Eriador/>

In the days of [[Atanatar II]] Alcarin this was replaced by a jewelled helm.<ref name=Eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Before replying to the challenge of the [[Witch-king]], [[Eärnur]] put the Crown of Elendil<ref group="note">The naming "crown of Elendil" in App. A is curious, considering the tradition that it consisted of Isildur's war-helm, later to be replaced by a newer one during Atanatar II's reign</ref> lay in the lap of King [[Eärnil II]] in the [[houses of the dead]]<ref name="Gondor"/> and it remained there even after his loss, for nearly a thousand years.

On [[1 May]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> the rightful heir ([[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] Telcontar) came forward to receive the crown.  The tradition had been for a new king to receive the crown from the hands of his father (or to obtain it from his father's tomb), but [[Faramir]] brought forth the casket with the ancient Crown and gave it to Aragorn.  After chanting "''Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien.  Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!''" Aragorn surprised the crowd by returning the crown to Faramir.  At his request, [[Frodo Baggins]] took the crown and bore it to [[Gandalf]], who placed it on King Elessar's head with the blessing, "Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the [[Valar]] endure!"<ref name="Steward"/>

In the year {{FoA|120}}<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> Aragorn went to the [[House of the Kings]] to lay down his life.  In that place he bade farewell to his son [[Eldarion]] and, following tradition, gave him the Crown of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] described it in his letters as being similar to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedjet crown of the Pharaohs of Egypt]. He writes "I think the crown of Gondor (the S. Kingdom) was very tall, like that of Egypt, but with wings attached, not set straight back but at an angle."<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref>
