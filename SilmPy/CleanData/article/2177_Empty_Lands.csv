The '''Empty Lands''' were regions in the [[East]] of [[Arda]] beyond the eastern boundaries of [[Middle-earth]]. Along with [[Belegaer]], they were "cast back" at the [[Changing of the World]], "and [[new lands]] and seas were made".<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

==Location==
As the Empty Lands were east of Middle-earth, [[Christopher Tolkien]] inferred that they corresponded to the [[Land of the Sun]] and possibly also the [[Dark Land]].<ref name=LR>{{LR|P1II4}}, pp. 31-32</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In their earliest appearance in Tolkien's drafts, the Empty Lands were called the "Barren Land".<ref name=LR /> When Belegaer and the Barren Land were "cast back," the "new lands and seas" were said to appear in areas where previously "nought had been but the paths of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]."<ref name=LR /> In a later draft, "Barren Land" was replaced with "Empty Land," which was eventually replaced with the final term "Empty Lands."<ref name=LR />
