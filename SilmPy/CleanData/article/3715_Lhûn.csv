The river '''Lhûn''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈɬuːːn]}}) or [[Westron]]ized '''Lune''' was a river of north-western [[Eriador]]. It gave its name to the [[Gulf of Lune]] and the [[Blue Mountains|Mountains of Lune]]. Of old, the Lhûn had been a line of defence: first against Sauron, and later against the [[Witch-king]].
==Course==
The river Lhûn found its origin in the [[First Age]] or before. The river had its sources in the far north of the Blue Mountains, and had two tributaries: the [[Little Lune]] and an unnamed river that had its origin in the [[Hills of Evendim|Emyn Uial]]. 

Its original course is no longer recorded in history, but following the [[War of Wrath]], its course was severely altered; after the breaking of the Blue Mountains, it flowed in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> 
==History==
In the [[Second Age]], the Lhûn formed the border between eastern [[Lindon]] and [[Arnor]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> [[Elendil]]'s [[Arnorians|people]] dwelt about the courses of the Lhûn.<ref name=rings/> During [[Sauron]]'s advent, [[Gil-galad]] and Elendil were desperately protecting the [[Grey Havens]], and managed to hold the Lhûn.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

During the [[Angmar War|War with Angmar]], it formed the end of the [[Witch-king]]'s influence: many of the Dúnedain fled across it. When [[Eärnil II]] came, passage was won back over it. With their defeat imminent, many of the Witch-king's minions drowned in the river Lhûn.<ref>{{HM|AA}}, "Gondor and the Heirs of Anarion"</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Lhûn'' is not known. In connection with its first appearance, in a manuscript dating from ca. 1940, the translation "Blue River" is given.<ref>{{HM|TI}}, "VI. The Council of Elrond (1): The Third Version, (iii)", p. 124</ref><ref name=VT48a5>{{VT|48a5}}</ref> Apparently, Tolkien originally envisioned it as [[Noldorin]] for "blue" (cf. [[Sindarin]] ''[[luin]]'').<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} (entry for LUG<sup>2</sup>-)</ref> ''Lhûn'', and especially the initial ''/lh/'', may have been valid in Noldorin, it was not so in [[Sindarin]], so Tolkien had to rewrite the etymology. He considered the following:<ref name=VT48a5/><ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 136-7</ref>
* [[Common Eldarin|CE]] Slōna, "floody"
* CE Slōnā, "in flood, full of water" (during melting season)
* CE Slounā, "flow freely"
* CE Slōno, "deep of water, applied originally to the Gulf!"
* A renaming to ''[[Sîr]] [[Luin]]'', "Blue River"
* CE Slōn, "sound"
* A [[Khuzdul]] origin, ''[[salôn]]'' or ''[[sulûn]]'', "fall, descend swiftly"
