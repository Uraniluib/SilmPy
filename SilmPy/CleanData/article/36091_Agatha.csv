'''Agatha''' was [[Farmer Giles]]' wife.  When [[Garm]] woke up the two of them with the news of the [[The Giant|Giant]]'s arrival, she first recommended drowning the dog, but when Giles indicated that he believed the dog she told him to be bold and quick.

When Giles became king of the [[Little Kingdom]], Agatha became a queen of great size and majesty.  She was known to keep a tight account upon the household.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>
