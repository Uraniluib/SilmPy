'''Appendix E''' is the fifth appendix to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and is entitled ''Writing and Spelling''.  It outlines how to pronounce particular sounds in the languages of Middle-earth, as well as the different writing systems used in Middle-earth.  The contents of this appendix are as follows.

In the ''Writing'' section, Tolkien briefly summarizes the history of the different writing systems, including the Tengwar of R&uacute;mil as well as the two major systems.  For the ''F&euml;anorian Letters'' he provides the table of the [[Tengwar]] then discusses the usage of the system and the names of the letters in narrative form.  For the [[Cirth]], a table of the [[Angerthas]] and the equivalent pronunciations is given, followed by a discussion of how different peoples modified the system.
