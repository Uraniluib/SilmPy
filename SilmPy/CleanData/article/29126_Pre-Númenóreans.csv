'''Pre-Númenóreans''' are the indigenous [[Men|Mannish peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]], in conrast to the [[Dúnedain]] who drew their heritage from [[Númenor]].

These indigenous peoples were the descendants of the second group of the [[Edain]] who migrated to the West in the [[First Age]]; their relatives who reached [[Beleriand]] became the [[House of Haleth|Haladin]] while themselves stayed in the eastern regions of Middle-earth that would be later settled by the [[Númenóreans]] (hence the name). 

From the perspective of the Dúnedain, these [[Middle Men]] were considered unrelated to them or the [[Northmen]]. 

==History==
===First Age===
The first Men moved from [[Hildórien]] to the [[Westlands|West]]; during their migration those of the second group joined the [[Woses|Drúedain]] near the [[White Mountains]] and stayed with them. When the core of their team was pressed to wander on, some Drúedain accompanied them westwards<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>, passing through the [[Gap of Rohan|Gap of Calenardhon]]. 

However some of them did not go through the dense forest covering the [[Minhiriath]] and the western half of [[Enedwaith]] and stayed behind. These were the ancestors of the Pre-Númenóreans. They became herd-tenders and eventually expanded to the forests of the shore-lands south of the [[Blue Mountains]], especially in Minhiriath.<ref name="DM">{{PM|X}}</ref>

By the end of the [[First Age]] the branches of those peoples must had spread as far as [[Cardolan]] in the north, and as far south as [[Umbar]].

===Second Age===
With the destruction of [[Beleriand]] in the [[War of Wrath]], evil Men and [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] fled from [[Angband]] and apparently took in larger numbers to the hills of [[Rhudaur]] and the Mountains of [[Angmar]]. The primitive pre-Númenóreans in the White Mountains (scattered communities of forest-dwellers without central leadership<ref name="GC"/>) who had refused to join in the rebellion against the Valar<ref name="DM"/> were terrorized and conquered by these evil Men.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> 

Those of the White Mountains migrated to the southern dales of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]], and thence some passed into the empty lands until the [[Barrow-downs]]; from them came the [[Men of Bree]].<ref name="lang">{{App|F1}}</ref>

When the Númenóreans returned to [[Middle-earth]], they failed to recognize the forest-folk of [[Minhiriath]] as "kinsmen" of the Edain, and confused them with [[Men of Shadow]] because their [[Pre-Númenórean|language]] was not related to [[Adûnaic]].<ref name="DM"/> 

In [[Gondor]] there were Pre-Númenórean communities far from the sea; the shores of the [[Bay of Belfalas]] were perhaps desolate except for [[Agar]]<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref> and a primitive harbour of fisherfolk. Those fled into the White Mountains in fear of the Eldar, who settled [[Edhellond]]<ref name="DM"/><ref name="GC"/>

Because of that, only the Númenórean settlers of [[Pelargir]] made contact with Men who dwelt in the valleys on either side of the White Mountains ({{SA|2350}}).<ref name="DM"/>

Aldarion's successors continued his works and even fought with the pre-Númenóreans<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> until they attacked and ambushed the Númenóreans when they could. They became their enemies giving no thought to husbandry or replanting. The Númenóreans wrecked the banks, the shorelines, and built great tracks and roads into the forests northwards and southwards from the [[Gwathló]].<ref name="GC"/> They continued battling and destroying what lay ahead of them, pushing into [[Minhiriath]] and [[Enedwaith]], establishing themselves inland as far as the river [[Glanduin]] (the southern boundary of [[Eregion]]), beyond which pre-Númenóreans and hostile peoples lived, a remnant of the peoples that had dwelt in the vales of the White Mountains in ages past.<ref name="lang"/><ref name="GC"/> The natives overcame their fear of the Elves and fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of [[Eryn Vorn]] (south of the mouth of [[Baranduin]]). Those from Enedwaith took refuge in the eastern mountains ([[Dunland]]).<ref name="GC"/>

[[Sauron]] recruited pre-Númenóreans and in the early second millennium he increased pressure on the West, left his stronghold in [[Rhûn]] and relocated in [[Mordor]]. He was welcomed by the natives and used the haters of Númenor as spies and guides for his raiders who caused havoc and burned their settlements.

Eriador was already ruined when the Númenórean fleet sent by king [[Tar-Minastir]] caught Mordor's troops in the rear and utterly defeated them, but brought peace in the [[Westlands]].<ref name="GC"/> The surviving pre-Númenóreans now apparently crossed the Glanduin back south to Dunland which now seemed safer than wrecked Eregion.

In the south the Númenóreans found a useful natural haven already called [[Umbar]] by the natives, and then [[Pelargir]] in {{SA|2350}} and discovered the [[Men of the Mountains]] near [[Dunharrow]]<ref>{{HM|RK}}</ref> who eventually repented when Sauron left from Mordor and the power of Gil-galad had grown great.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

When the [[Elendili]] established the [[Realms in Exile]], many Men turned from evil and became subject to them although the pre-Númenóreans were not friendly to them and never learned to distinguish between [[King's Men]] and [[Faithful]], while many remembered Sauron's influence.<ref name="Rings"/> The [[King of the Dead|King of the Mountains]] first swore allegiance to [[Gondor]].

When Sauron returned, [[Isildur]] summoned the [[Men of the Mountains]] to fulfill their oath, they would not because they were afraid of Sauron. They hid in the mountains isolated till slowly dwindled in the barren hills and became the [[Dead Men of Dunharrow]].

===Third Age===
The indigenous Men of Eriador were absorbed by the civilisation of [[Arnor]].<ref name="lang"/> By the time of [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] this mixed population was diminished and there was not enough people to maintain all the places built by Elendil, until eventually Arnor was split into smaller realms.<ref name="Rings"/> However when the [[Hobbits]] came to Arnor, Númenóreans, allies and enemies were numerous.<ref name="DM"/> The Númenorean element was stronger in [[Arthedain]] and thinner in [[Rhudaur]] until utterly failed. Eventually [[Angmar]] was populated by evil men gathered by the [[Witch-king]].<ref name="A">{{HM|AA}}</ref>

The indigenous Men were also absorbed in the South Kingdom of [[Gondor]], which pursued an expansionist policy. Gondor's borders were extended by the [[Ship-kings]], subduing the pre-Númenóreans. Their blood was mixed and in the following generations the Dúnedain's power and wisdom was diminished.<ref name="Rings"/>

[[Hill-men]] practiced [[magic]]<ref>{{PM|Third}}</ref> and from the 14th century on, fortified the hills of Eriador with dark structures<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> harassed Rhudaur until an evil lord, allied with Angmar, seized its throne and eventually all of Rhudaur was occupied by evil Men subject to Angmar. The Dúnedain were either slain or fled west<ref name="A"/>. The [[Angmar War]] however caused those populations to perish.<ref name="DM"/> [[Cardolan]] was also deserted and could not be repopulated<ref name="Elendil"/>. Rhudaur came to be inhabited only by monsters. After the [[Great Plague]], [[Minhiriath]] was deserted except for hunters in [[Eryn Vorn]]. Other known Mannish settlements included only the [[Bree-land]] and the [[Lossoth]] in the far North.

As Gondor expanded East and South, the few remote [[Dunlendings]] resisted the Númenórean influence and [[Enedwaith]] had no such settlements,<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> other than [[Tharbad]].<ref name="DM"/> They remained unaffected, independent and even unfriendly to the Dúnedain, holding their own manners and [[Dunlendish]] language.<ref name="lang"/> However the Dunlendings also remained hostile to those with [[Orc]]-blood.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> The Dunlendings also dwelt alongside the [[Stoor]] Hobbits during their [[Wandering Days]] and the latter even formed a related language to theirs.<ref name="lang"/>

The Dunlendings suffered from the Great Plague less than other peoples owing to their isolation<ref name="lang"/> and were still found in the foothills of the Misty Mountains. By the time of the [[Ruling Stewards]] they ceased to be subjects of Gondor and, being surrounded by barbarous folk<ref name="GC"/>, they moved to settle the region of [[Calenardhon]] as its people dwindled during the [[Watchful Peace]].<ref name="Isen"/>

In {{TA|2510}} Calenardhon passed to the Northern [[Eotheod]] who came from [[Rhovanion]] and were viewed as usurpers by the wild hill-men and Dunlending herd-folk. [[Kings of Rohan|Kings]] [[Brego]] and [[Aldor]] drove the Dunlendings out of [[Rohan]] beyond the Isen until Enedwaith. As the ensuing enmity did not concern the [[Stewards]], the Dunlendings kept hostilities to the [[Rohirrim]] and attacked whenever the latter were weak or in trouble.<ref name="Isen"/> 

After the death of King Aldor, and as [[Isengard]] became more friendly to them, the Dunlendings passed and settled northern [[Westfold]], the mountain glens around the Ring, and southern eaves of Fangorn, becoming openly hostile.<ref name="Isen"/> This allowed the two peoples to mingle in some peaceful circumstances; and the dark-haired Landlord [[Freca]] was said to have Dunlendish blood<ref name="A"/> When it became clear that the raiders were coming from near Isengard, in {{TA|2710}} King [[Déor]] led an expedition to the north. He found and defeated a host of Dunlendings, but discovered that Isengard was held by hostile forces.

Freca's son, [[Wulf]], allied with the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] who were in turn stirred by Sauron, keeping safe his properties at [[Adorn]]. Joining his kin from outside of Rohan with enemies of Gondor that had landed in the mouths of [[Lefnui]] and Isen, Rohan was invaded from the East, the Isen and Isengard, finally losing [[Edoras]]. Gondor, fighting Corsair fleets, could not help.<ref name="A"/> The usurping Dunlendings were reduced after the [[Long Winter]] and finished off by [[Fréaláf]]. The Rohirrim now kept a strong force in north Westfold.<ref name="Isen"/>

Eventually many Dunlendings were found later in the [[West-March]], until again [[Folcwine]], aided by Gondor, reconquered it.<ref name="A"/> But the people remaining between Isen and Adorn were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref name="Isen"/>

Before the [[War of the Ring]], [[Saruman]] found in those peoples an opportunity for creating crossbreeds of Orcs and Men. The Dunlendings allied with him and joined his forces in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After the War, under King [[Éomer]], there was relative peace.<ref name="A"/>
