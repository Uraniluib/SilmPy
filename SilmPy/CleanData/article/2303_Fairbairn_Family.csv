__NOTOC__
The '''Fairbairn Family''' was the family name of the descendants of [[Samwise Gamgee]], through his eldest daughter [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]] and her husband [[Fastred of Greenholm]], because her elvish beauty was long inherited by her descendants.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>

Fastred became the first [[Warden of Westmarch]], a title handed down to his son [[Elfstan Fairbairn]] and his descendants. The family seat was at [[Undertowers]] on the [[Tower Hills]], so that the family are often referred to as the 'Fairbairns of the Towers'.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

The Fairbairns were also the heirs of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] to which they made additions and also created copies.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 134</ref>
