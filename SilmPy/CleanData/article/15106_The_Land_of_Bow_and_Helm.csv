'''The Land of Bow and Helm''' is the eighth chapter of ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.

==Synopsis==
The coming of [[Beleg]] to [[Bar-en-Danwedh]] and the return of the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin|Dragon-helm]] to [[Túrin]] brought about a change in both the fortunes and focus of the men of [[Amon Rûdh]]. As a host they seemed in their forays with the marauding companies of [[orcs]] that came down the [[Sirion]] and they spread fear and dread. So did Túrin’s whereabouts come to the knowledge of [[Morgoth]], and the enemy set his devices in motion to capture Túrin; for he was patient in his malice as he had been with his father, [[Húrin]], and put forward his forces only to test Túrin’s mettle and give him false confidence.

On a time, the valour of Beleg’s bow and the Dragon-helm brought forth those dispossessed men who were drawn to wage war with the enemy, and the force of men grew so that there were many camps about the woods of Amon Rûdh. [[Dor-Cúarthol]] Túrin called his domain in pride, and himself [[Gorthol]], The Dread Helm; but Beleg was wary of the doom ahead and counselled caution but to this Túrin took little heed for he had confidence in his own will.

It was at this time that [[Mîm|Mîm’s]] curse of [[Andróg]] came to fruition: he once again took up a bow and was poisoned by an orc arrow; but the power of Beleg healed him of the wound. This went ill with Mîm, who already had a hatred of all things [[Elves|elven]] and so he chose to betray Túrin’s men. Mîm passed to a company of orcs and revealed to them the stronghold of Bar-en-Danwedh and led a force to its doors.

There the [[Gaurwaith|outlaws]] were bested but Andróg revealed to Túrin the secret stair to the summit of the hill and there there was a final stand. Against a stone all but Túrin and Beleg were slain and Andróg was wounded mortally by an orc shaft. Beleg was pinned on the summit while Túrin was taken alive as prisoner – for so were Morgoth’s commands.

When all was passed, Mîm came to torment Beleg in that high place, but Andróg crept forth and thrust a sword at the [[Petty-dwarf]] who leapt from the heights in fear. In his final agony, Andróg released Beleg; then he died.
