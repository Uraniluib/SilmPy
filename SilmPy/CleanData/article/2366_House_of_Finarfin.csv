The '''House of Finarfin''' was the descendants and followers of [[Finarfin]], third son of [[Finwë]] who followed [[Fëanor]]. A particular aspect of this house is that many had golden hair, due to their half-[[Vanyar]]in heritage.

During the march on [[Aman]] Finarfin himself repented when heard the [[Doom of Mandos|Doom of the Noldor]] and returned to the West with some of his followers.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

His children, led by [[Finrod]], came to [[Beleriand]], and that is why his House is also named [[House of Finrod]]. [[Galadriel]] belonged to this house as well as [[Gildor Inglorion]]<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> and perhaps [[Glorfindel]]<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 204, entry House of Finrod</ref>. Such [[Elves]] remained in [[Middle-earth]] until the late [[Third Age]].
