'''Tol Morwen''' was an island off the coast of [[Forlindon]].

==History==
Tol Morwen was the site of the [[Stone of the Hapless]] and the grave of [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]], hence its name. It was the westernmost of the islands that were created when [[Beleriand]] was sunk in the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>

==Location==
[[File:Didier Willis - Location of Tol Morwen.png|thumb|left|300px|Approximate (speculative) location of Tol Morwen.]]
The place is only attested in the texts, and neither the grave of Morwen nor the later island are represented on any of Tolkien's map published so far. Being close to the gorge of [[Cabed-en-Aras]], the location of this site may nevertheless reasonably be inferred near the gorges of the [[Teiglin]] and above its ravines.<ref>{{HM|WJ}}</ref>

Superimposing the map of Beleriand in the First Age and the map of the Westlands in the Third Age therefore allows to approximate the location of the island.<ref>See for instance [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''</ref>
