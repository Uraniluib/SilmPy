'''Arktik''' (or '''Arctic'''<ref>{{LFC|1937}}</ref>) was the language spoken by the folk of the [[North Pole]]: the [[Red Elves]], the [[Polar Bear]], and others.<ref>{{LFC|1929a}}</ref>

A sample of Arktik is seen in one of the letters: ''Mára mesta an ni véla tye ento, ya rato nea'' which translates as "Good-bye until I see you next, and I hope it will be soon."

==Inspiration==
Although the ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]'' are not part of the [[legendarium]], the known sample of Arktik written by Tolkien is actually [[Qenya]], which he had developed by then.<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/corpus.htm|articlename=The Quenya Corpus}}</ref>

[[:Category:Linguists|Tolkien linguists]] sometimes refer to it as '''Arctic Q(u)enya'''.<ref>{{VT|41c}}, p. 16; {{VT|47a}}, p. 40</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Ryszard Derdzinski]]|articleurl=http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/bibliography.htm|articlename=Tolkien's Linguistic Writings and Drafts|website=[http://www.elvish.org Elvish.org]}}</ref>
