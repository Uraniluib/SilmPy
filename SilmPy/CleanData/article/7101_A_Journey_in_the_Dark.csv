'''A Journey in the Dark''' is the fourth chapter of the second book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
[[Gandalf]] told the [[Fellowship of the Ring|fellowship]] that the only way under the [[Misty Mountains|mountains]] was through the Mines of [[Moria]], underground tunnels in which a group of [[Dwarves]] led by [[Balin]] had disappeared years ago.

When they reached the gates of Moria, the [[Sirannon|gate-stream]] had been dammed and the entrance was flooded. Gandalf let the [[Bill the Pony|pony]] free and sent it back to [[Rivendell]]. Finding the runes on the gate, the Fellowship pondered a riddle: the quote, "''Speak 'friend', and enter.''" [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] alone of the fellowship was on the right track, and he helped Gandalf find the answer. Gandalf used the secret password, "''mellon''", to gain them entrance.  Before they could go in, though, they were attacked by a tentacled water creature, the [[Watcher in the Water]], that particularly targeted [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. To escape, they all went into the Mines, but the Watcher destroyed the entrance behind them. They had no choice but to go forward through the Mines.

Fissures and chasms made their path treacherous. [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] was reminded that he should have carried rope with him. At one point, they entered a stone doorway and found a deep well inside it. [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] threw a stone into it out of impulse, and they began to hear a tapping, as if someone was using a hammer. They walked on for as long as they could, coming to many paths and crossroads, resting little and eating less. The Mines of Moria were famous for silver ''[[mithril]]'' and it was in search of this that Balin and his Dwarves had come to Moria. Gandalf told them that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] had a coat of mail armour made of ''mithril'' and Frodo marvelled when he realised that Bilbo had gifted him with a suit of armour with a value worth the whole of the [[Shire]].

When they continued on their journey the next day, they came upon a tomb and Gandalf read what was written on it. They realise that the tomb belonged to Balin son of [[Fundin]]. Frodo was sorry when he realised that Bilbo's good friend and companion was dead.
