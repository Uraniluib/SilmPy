'''J.R. Titmass''' was a [[Man]] living in the [[wikipedia:21st century|21st century]] [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Britain]].

== History ==
Titmass was a well-known historian of the [[wikipedia:20th century|20th century]] [[Oxford]]. When Mr. [[Howard Green]], the school clerk of the [[wikipedia:Examination Schools|Examination Schools]] in Oxford found the [[Notion Club Papers]] in the basement of the said school, Titmass was the one who had shown that the name of [[Nicholas Guildford]], the reporter of the Club, was certainly a fictitious name and derived from a medieval dialogue at one time read in the Schools of Oxford (''[[wikipedia:The Owl and the Nightingale|The Owl and the Nightingale]]'')<ref name="Foreword">{{SD|2b}}</ref>

He later informed Green that he couldn't find any record in the [[1940]]'s of the names given in the Papers, so that Green assumed that if any such club existed at that period, the names would have to be pseudonyms.<ref name="Foreword"/>
