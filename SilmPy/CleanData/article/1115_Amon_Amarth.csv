{{main|Mount Doom}}
'''Amon Amarth''' was a rarely used name for [[Orodruin]], the flaming mountain in northern [[Mordor]] where [[Sauron]] forged [[the One Ring]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

The name was given because the volcano was linked in ancient and little-understood prophecies with the final end of the [[Third Age]], when [[the One Ring]] was found again.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 768-9</ref>
