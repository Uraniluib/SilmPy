'''The Uruk-hai attack on Osgiliath''' in {{TA|2475}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> was the first large-scale attack against [[Gondor]] after the end of the [[Watchful Peace]].  The race of uruks, described as black [[Orcs|orcs]] of great strength, first appeared in this battle and were able to sweep across [[Ithilien]] and take [[Osgiliath]].  [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]] son of [[Denethor I]] was able to defeat this force and clear them from Ithilien, but the city was finally ruined, its great stone-bridge was broken, and no one lived in the city thereafter.  During this brief war Boromir received a Morgul-wound that shrunk him with pain and caused his premature death but twelve years after his father.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>
