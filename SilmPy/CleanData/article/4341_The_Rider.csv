'''The Rider''' was a shadowy creature of [[Elvish]] legend, sent by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] to trouble the first [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]]. The true identity of the Rider is unknown. The legend could have had its source in lies spread by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] about [[Oromë]], in an attempt to deceive the Elves into thinking that he was evil. It is also possible that the Rider was one of the "''shadows and [[Spirits (creatures)|evil spirits]]''" sent by Melkor to spy upon and harass the [[Quendi]], or even Melkor himself.<ref name=S3>{{S|3}}</ref>
