'''Wellinghall''' was one of the [[Ent-houses]] of [[Treebeard]], formed by a narrow space in the flanks of [[Methedras]], guarded and flanked by evergreen trees. The roofless 'hall' came to an end in a sheer rock wall, down which flowed a stream welling - hence the name 'Wellinghall' - from the springs of the River [[Entwash]]. The stream flowed down the rocky cliff, and fell across the arched entrance to an inner hall, where [[Treebeard]] kept his meagre furniture. From there, it flowed between the trees that lined the main space, and on to join again with the main flow of the Entwash. 

Wellinghall is best known as the place where [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] stayed with Treebeard on the night before [[Entmoot]], on [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> It was here that they were first given [[Ent-draughts]] by Treebeard, and so grew to become the two tallest [[Hobbits]] recorded in the histories of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[Treebeard]] translation (into the [[Westron|Common Speech]]) for part of the name of his dwelling. It meant "hall (under or behind) the outflow of the spring of Entwash".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 778</ref>
