The '''Cirith Ninniach''', the "Rainbow Cleft", was a thin, rocky pass through the ''[[Ered Lómin]]'' ("Echoing Mountains") in the far northwest of Beleriand.<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref>
==History==
The Cirith Ninniach connected the land of [[Hithlum]] with the [[Firth of Drengist]] which led to the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref name="Map"/>  Although not explicitly stated, when [[Fëanor]] led his followers up the Firth and into Hithlum they must have found and used Cirith Ninniach to achieve their passage.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

During King [[Turgon]]'s stay in [[Nevrast]] the [[Gate of the Noldor]], a dark tunnel under the mountains, was built which opened into the pass.  Centuries later, after Turgon and his people had abandoned the region for [[Gondolin]], Tuor found and used both the Gate of the Noldor and Cirith Ninniach to escape from Hithlum.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

Tuor found the Cirith Ninniach by following a stream that flowed from [[Dor-Lómin]] to the [[Ered Lómin]] and then disappeared into a great arch in a wall of rock.  At first he though that there was no passage but then he saw two [[Elves]] issue from the archway.  [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] they were, and they told him that he had found the [[Gate of the Noldor]].  The two Elves led Tuor into the tunnel beside the stream and down long flights of steps.  They left Tuor beside a waterfall and he continued until he emerged into a narrow ravine that ran straight into the West.  In the pass the stream rushed over falls and wove rainbows; thus he named the ravine Cirith Ninniach.

Tuor traveled in the pass for four days, watching the stream turn into a river fed by shimmering falls that descended the walls of Cirith Ninniach.  The pass ended when the river met the sea in the narrow Firth of Drengist.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Cirith Ninniach'' means "Pass of the Slender Crossing" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[cirith]]'' = "cleft, pass", ''[[ninn]]'' = "slender", and ''[[iach]]'' = "ford, crossing").

An early ([[Gnomish]]) name for the pass was ''Glorfalc'', the "Golden Cleft".<ref>{{HM|IX}}, p. 187</ref><ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 341</ref>
