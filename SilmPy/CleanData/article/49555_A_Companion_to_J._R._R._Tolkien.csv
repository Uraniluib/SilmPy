==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|A Companion to J.R.R. Tolkien is a complete resource for scholars and students of one of the twentieth century's most successful and influential authors. It provides an in–depth examination of Tolkien's entire work by a cadre of top scholars. The essays introduce and analyze his life and works, from The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion to his lesser–known fiction and academic publications. They also explore the role of various themes and influences across his body of work, such as mythmaking, medieval languages, nature, war, religion, and the defeat of evil. The contributors situate Tolkien's writing within the context ofother literary periods and genres and analyze his influence on subsequent generations of fantasy writers.  They also discuss the impact of his work on art, film, music, and gaming, from his lifetime to the present. Up–to–date and comprehensive, this survey of Tolkien studies reflects the continuing influence of his work on the literature and society of today.}}
