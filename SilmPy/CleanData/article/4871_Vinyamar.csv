'''Vinyamar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈvinjamar]}}) was a settlement built by [[Turgon]] in [[Nevrast]], on the slopes of [[Mount Taras]],<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> early in the [[Exile of the Noldor]]. It was perched upon high terraces that looked towards the sea. It was never visited by the servants of [[Morgoth]] but after its abandonment it became weathered. Turgon's great hall had its walls and roof covered with a deep growth of plants.<ref name="Tuor">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

==History==
Vinyamar was the first recorded [[Noldor]] stone construction after they had returned to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="Tuor"/> Vinyamar's population was primarily Noldorin, with a large influx of [[Sindar]]in elves.

In {{FA|50}}<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> Turgon and [[Finrod]] took a journey along the river [[Sirion]]. At the [[Meres of Twilight]] they slept and both received a dream from [[Ulmo]], bidding them to see places of strength.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> Two years later<ref>{{GA|76}}</ref> Turgon discovered the hidden way and vale of [[Tumladen]] wherein he determined to build [[Gondolin]]. In {{FA|64}} Turgon led a third of his people to the valley to begin construction of his hidden city.<ref>{{GA|88}}</ref> By {{FA|116}} Gondolin was full-wrought and Turgon led the remainder of his folk to the city; from then on Vinyamar was abandoned and fell into decay.<ref>{{GA|113}}</ref>

Much later, in {{FA|495}}, [[Tuor]] came to the deserted settlement. Marvelling, he entered Turgon's old hall and on a wall, lit by the setting sun, he found a shield, hauberk, helm, and sword. The shield bore a filed of blue and a white swan's wing. Tuor took these items and wore them. In the meantime, [[Voronwë]] was rescued by [[Ulmo]] from a shipwreck and was brought near the city; when the two met, they left Vinyamar together for a journey that led to Gondolin.<ref name="Tuor"/>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Quenya]] for "New Home" from ''[[vinya]]'' "young, new" and ''[[-mbar|mar]]'' "house, home, dwelling".<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Vinyamar''</ref>
