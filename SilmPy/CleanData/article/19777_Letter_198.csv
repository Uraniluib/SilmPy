==Summary==
An (unidentified) American filmmaker had expressed interest in making a cartoon film of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Tolkien welcomed the idea of an animated motion picture, even with the possibility of vulgarization. On the brink of his retirement, extra money would be welcome too. Tolkien concluded with the remark that he found vulgarization less painful than the sillification, achieved by the [[BBC]] in their [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|radio series]].
