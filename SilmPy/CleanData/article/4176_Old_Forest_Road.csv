The '''Old Forest Road''' or '''Men-i-Naugrim''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''[[men (Elvish)|men]]'' "road, way" + ''[[in]]'' "the, who" + ''[[Naugrim]]'' "dwarves"; "Way of the Dwarves") or simply the '''Dwarf-road'''<ref name=index>{{UT|Index}}</ref> was the main route through the great forest originally known as [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and latterly as [[Mirkwood]].

==History==
The name '''Dwarf-road''' suggests that the road was apparently built or at least used as a trade-route by the [[Dwarves]] (who had a tradition of road-building dating back to before the [[First Age]]). Indeed in the early [[Second Age]] the lands of the [[Longbeards]] controlled [[Erebor]], [[Ered Mithrin]], [[Ered Engrin]], and the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]] as south as [[Lorien]].<ref>{{PM|Relations}}</ref><ref name=note/>{{rp|n. 30}}</ref>

The location suggests that it carried traffic between the western and eastern clans. The latitude of the road is halfway between the ancient Dwarven meeting-place at [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] to the north, and [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] to the south.

Near the end of the [[Second Age]], a stone bridge crossed the [[Anduin]] over the only point that it could be crossed, as the waters were slower. This was specially enlarged and strengthened to carry the armies of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. By the latter [[Third Age]] no such bridge was mentioned and the river was crossed by the [[Old Ford]].<ref>{{UT|Disaster}}, Note 14</ref>

[[Beorn]] warned [[Thorin and Company]] that it was often used by [[Orcs|Goblins]] and inside the forest, the road was overgrown and disused.<ref name=lodg/>

==Route==
The road descended from the [[Pass of Imladris]], crossed [[Anduin]], and traversed Mirkwood.<ref name=index/>

Where the Road crossed the Great River, there was originally a stone bridge, but later it had been lost and the river was crossed by the [[Old Ford]]. From there, it crossed some miles of open country before plunging into the depths of the forest Mirkwood. The Road then ran directly east from one side of the forest to the other, covering more than two hundred miles beneath the canopy of trees before it emerged by the banks of the River [[River Running|Running]]. At the eastern end it led to impassable [[Long Marshes|marshes]] where the paths had long been lost.<ref name=lodg>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Then it traversed Greenwood (the portion that remained known as "Old Forest Road") and then turned to the north-east towards the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name=note>{{PM|XNotes}}</ref>{{rp|n. 30}}
==Etymology==
[[Sindarin]] from ''[[men (Sindarin word)|men]]'' "road", ''[[i]]'' "the" and ''[[Naugrim]]'' "[[dwarves]]".{{fact}}
