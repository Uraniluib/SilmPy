The '''warning beacons of Gondor''' were an alarm system for the realm of [[Gondor]].
==History==
<blockquote>“See, there is the fire on [[Amon Dîn]], and flame on [[Eilenach]]; and there they go speeding west: [[Nardol]], [[Erelas]], [[Min-Rimmon]], [[Calenhad]], and the [[Amon Anwar|Halifirien]] on the borders of [[Rohan]]” — [[Gandalf]] to [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]<ref name=RK>{{HM|RK}}</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>“…The Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts on these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to [[Rohan]] in the North, or to [[Belfalas]] in the South.” — [[Gandalf]] to [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]<ref name=RK/></blockquote>

The beacons were two series of permanently manned stations maintained by the lord of [[Minas Tirith]] for raising the alarm in northern and southern [[Gondor]] respectively.  The stations were on the summits of foothills in the [[White Mountains]] (''[[Ered Nimrais]]''). The stations kept signal fires in readiness and stabled fresh horses for couriers.

The northern posts, listed from nearest to [[Minas Tirith]] to nearest [[Rohan]], were ''[[Amon Dîn]]'', ''[[Eilenach]]'', ''[[Nardol]]'', ''[[Erelas]]'', ''[[Min-Rimmon]]'', ''[[Calenhad]]'' and ''Halifirien'' (or ''[[Amon Anwar]]'').

We can only speculate on the positions of the southern posts, but based on the description of following foothills of the [[White Mountains]], and their spread of 20 to 30 miles, there may have been as many as ten beacons along the southern foothills, following a course west by southwest through [[Lebennin]] and passing through the hills north of [[Dor-en-Ernil]], south of [[Ringló]].

In the late [[Second Age]] and early [[Third Age]], they mainly served to warn south Gondor of a danger for the northern province of [[Calenardhon]], or vice versa, but after the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] [[Cirion]] granted Calenardhon to the [[Éothéod]] they were used mainly to warn the people in [[Anórien]] (the only part of Calenardhon Gondor kept in its realm) of danger.

Calls for aid between Gondor and [[Rohan]] were exchanged by a messenger carrying the [[Red Arrow]] instead.

During the [[War of the Ring]] the beacons were lit when [[Minas Tirith]] came under siege, and as the [[Rohirrim]] rode to Gondor's aid they passed all seven beacons by on their way east.

The tomb of [[Elendil]] was hidden on the summit of Halifirien, westernmost of the beacon mountains.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:One of the major changes made to the story is that when [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] ride to [[Minas Tirith]] the beacons are ''not'' lit, since the despairing [[Denethor]] has decided not to ask for help. In the movie there is a beacon just above the city, and to summon the Rohirrim Gandalf asks Pippin to evade the guards and light it. Once he has done so, the film depicts the other beacons being lit one by one until the last is sighted by [[Aragorn]] who is in [[Edoras]], and it is this (and not the [[Red Arrow]], which is not mentioned in the film) which finally helps him to persuade [[Théoden]] to muster the Rohirrim to Gondor's aid.

:Another change is that in the movie there are thirteen beacons as opposed to the seven described in the book.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Lighting of the Beacons]]"</ref><ref group=note>Also, the beacons were depicted as signal fires only (without stables), atop mountain peaks instead of foothills.</ref>

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:[[Halifirien]] was visible in the distance from the [[Rohirrim]] town of "Beaconwatch" in the [[Eastfold]]. The regions of Western, Central and Eastern [[Gondor]] together featured ten southern beacons running from [[Belfalas]] to [[Lossarnach]]. These were, from west to east: Amon Lontir, Nendath, Maegond, the Fallen Beacon, Eilendoth, Dol Brannor, Anglebed, Sirthanc, and Minlos. In addition, there appeared to be an unnamed, inaccessible beacon across the river from [[Pelargir]].
