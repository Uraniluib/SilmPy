'''Daurin''', also called '''Tórin''' was a [[Noldo|Gnome]] of the [[Elder Days]]. He was notable for attacking [[Morgoth|Melko]] and [[Ungoliant|Gwerlum]] when they were attempting to destroy the [[Two Trees]]. After he had cut off one of Gwerlum's legs, she threw a web around him and Melko killed him. He then took his blade which was laced with the black, poisonous blood of Gwerlum and proceeded to destroy the other tree, [[Silpion]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 169</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The character that was to become Daurin was originally supposed to be [[Fëanor]] but this was abandoned. Then his name was changed to '''Daurlas''', a kinsman of Fëanor, and finally to '''Daurin (Tórin)'''<ref>{{LT1|VI}}: "Notes and Commentary", p. 172</ref>
