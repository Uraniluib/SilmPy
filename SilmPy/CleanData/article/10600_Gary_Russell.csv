==Quotes==
{{quote|To me, it starts with the conceptual art, the earliest sketches and drawings done back in 1996/7. Then it goes on through the [[Weta Workshop|Weta]] stuff, with paintings, maquettes and everything right up to the commencement of filming - and beyond. I deliberately wanted to avoid focussing on the actual finished film itself as [[Brian Sibley]]'s book covered that so well.|Gary Russell, [http://archives.theonering.net/features/newsroom/files/053102_gary.html TheOneRing.net chat].}}
