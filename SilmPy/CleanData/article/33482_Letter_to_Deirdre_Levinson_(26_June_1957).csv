*'''Publication:''' A description of the letter was included in ''[[Michael Silverman Catalogue 23]]'' and in ''Bonhams Books, Maps and Manuscripts 23 March 2004''.<ref name=Books>[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=72490 Books, Maps and Manuscripts. 2004] & [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=72495 Manuscripts and Autograph Letters. 2004] at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ TolkienBooks.net] (accessed 26 November 2011)</ref>
*'''Description:''' Tolkien comments on conditions in South Africa, and gives Levinson news of various appointments in [[Oxford]], including [[Nevill Coghill]] as the Merton Professor of English Literature, and [[Elaine Griffiths]] as a Lecturer. Tolkien was shocked by the death of [[wikipedia:Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]] but relieved by the general tone of his obituaries. He is sorry "''to be pinned down to beer, especially in quantity. On the whole it goes down better with tobacco than other drinks; but I have never been a gargantuan swiller of it''".<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], [http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/chronology.html Addenda and Corrigenda to ''The J.R.R.
