==Summary==
[[wikipedia:Walter Hooper|Walter Hooper]] had sent a new volume of ''[[wikipedia:Of Other Worlds|Of Other Worlds]]'', a book of collected material of [[C.S. Lewis]], who had died three year prior. Tolkien wrote a two-sentence response, with a post scriptum acknowledging how short that reply was. He commented on Lewis' dualistic mind and imagination, and called the "miserific vision" rationally nonsense and theologically blasphemous.
