'''Elvish Song in Rivendell''' is a poem written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], probably dating from the early 1930s. Apparently, the poem was at some point intended by Tolkien to be included in the chapter "A Short Rest" from ''The Hobbit'', following the passage: "The [the elves] went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full." It exists in two versions, one untitled and titled. The latter (supposedly the latest) was published for the first time by [[Douglas A. Anderson]] in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition]]'' (2002).

==Excerpt (first stanza)==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Come home, come home, ye merry folk!
The sun is sinking, and the oak
   In gloom has wrapped his feet.
Come home! The shades of evening loom
Beneath the hills, and palely bloom
   Night-flowers white and sweet.
</poem>
