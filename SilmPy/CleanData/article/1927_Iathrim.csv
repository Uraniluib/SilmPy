The '''Elves of Doriath''' were those [[Sindar]] that lived in the broad forests of central [[Beleriand]], [[Neldoreth]], and [[Forest of Region|Region]], under the Kingship of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] and later [[Dior|Dior Eluch√≠l]]. These people, whose [[Melian|Queen]] was of the order of the [[Maiar]] and whose King was the High King of the Sindar, were held to be the highest and noblest of the [[Sindar|Grey-elven]] kindred.
