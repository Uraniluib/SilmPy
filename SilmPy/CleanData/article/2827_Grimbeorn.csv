'''Grimbeorn the Old''' was the son of [[Beorn]].

==History==
Grimbeorn became a great lord in his own right. Like his father, he was the chieftain of the [[Beornings]] and he dwelt in the same regions of the [[Vales of Anduin]]. During his time, the [[High Pass]] and the [[Ford of Carrock]] were kept open and no [[Orcs|Orc]] or [[Wargs|Wolf]] dared to enter his land.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

==Etymology==
While ''Beorn'' is a word related to "bear", ''Grim'' (like in modern English) means "fierce", therefore his name can be translated as "Fierce bear".
