[[File:Abe Papakhian - Elendil and Sons.jpg|thumb|Abe Papakhian - ''Elendil and Sons'']]'''High King''' was a title used by the [[Dúnedain]] for their ultimate ruler. Normally, "High King" would refer to a king who ruled over other lesser kings and lords, but this is not necessarily the case with the High King of the Dúnedain. 

In [[Gil-galad's letter]], [[Tar-Meneldur]] the fifth King of [[Númenor]], was referred as "High King",<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> though he had no other rulers in his service.<ref group=note>Possibly the title refers to the King's overlosrdship over the colonists of [[Middle-earth]].</ref>

The more common use of the title, though, came at the end of the [[Second Age]], with the establishment of the [[Realms in Exile]] in [[Middle-earth]]. In their earliest years, the [[Reunited Kingdom|Two Kingdoms]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] fell under the ultimate rule of one man, [[Elendil]], who dwelt in Arnor as the High King. The South-kingdom of Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons, but only under his suzerainty.

With Elendil's loss in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], his elder son [[Isildur]] inherited the High Kingship. Isildur ruled for only two years, though, before he too was lost in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]. After his death, historical events conspired to separate the Two Kingdoms, each of which took Kings of their own. The High Kingship should in principle have fallen on Isildur's heir [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], but in practice Valandil became King of Arnor only, and had no power over the South-kingdom.

More than three thousand years were to pass before [[Aragorn]] [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited]] Elendil's realms. In doing so, as the direct descendant of Isildur, as well as [[Anárion]], through many generations, he also resurrected the High Kingship.
