'''Snowmane''' was the [[horses|steed]] of [[Théoden]], [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]]. His sire was [[Lightfoot]]<ref name=v6/> and was probably one of the [[Mearas]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 362</ref>

Théoden rode with him to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. The steed was killed when struck with a black dart by the [[Witch-king]], and he fell on the King, mortally wounding him.<ref name=v6>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

Snowmane, also referred to as ''Théoden's Bane'' and ''Master's Bane'', was buried where he fell. On the site known as [[Snowmane's Howe]] a stone was erected the grass grew the most green ever after.<ref name=v6/>
==Etymology==
''Snowmane'' is the Modern English form of [[Old English]] (which represents [[Rohirric]]) ''snāw-mana''. The proper Rohirric name was thus ''Snawmana''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 763</ref>
