[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explored various possibilities regarding the exact interpretation of the elements occurring in the name ''[[Azanulbizar]]''; it was to somehow mean "Dimrill Dale".

In one interpretation, ''Azanulbizar'' means "The rills of the shadows", whereas the word "dale" is understood (the full name being ''[[duban]] Azanulbizar'', but ''duban'' "dale, valley" is left out so that the place was simply called ''Azanulbizar''). 

In another, the whole phrase "Dimrill Dale" fits into the word ''Azanulbizar'' since the ''bizar'' part that means "dale", and "rill(s)" or "streams" corresponds to the middle element ''[[ûl]]''
