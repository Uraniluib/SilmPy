'''''Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien''''' by Steven Hillard gives a fictional portrayal of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

In February 2011, the ''Guardian'' reported that the [[Tolkien Estate]] is demanding the destruction of all copies of the novel and an immediate halt to further sales, stating that Hillard "''trivialises the name, personality and reputation of the late professor''".<ref>Dalya Alberge, "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/feb/26/mirkwood-jrr-tolkien-legal-battle JRR Tolkien novel Mirkwood in legal battle with author's estate]" (26 February 2011) at [http://www.guardian.co.uk/ Guardian.co.uk] (accessed 8 March 2011)</ref>

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien by Steve Hillard tells of Tolkien hiding secret documents that the forces of evil will do anything to obtain, and the young orphan girl, Cadence, who discovers them. In the opening pages of Hillard's novel, world-renowned author and linguist Tolkien lands in New York City on a mysterious errand. He carries with him a collection of ancient documents, many in an unknown language that hint of a heroine, a halfling named Ara, who lived in the same ancient landscape that inspired Tolkien's Middle-earth. Fearing that possession of the documents will lead to great harm, Tolkien entrusts them to a simple scissor sharpener named Jesse Grande. Almost four decades later, Grande has disappeared and the documents have been found by Grande's orphaned granddaughter, Cadence. As dark forces from the realm of fantasy hunt down the documents and their guardian, Cadence must protect the story of Ara. "Tolkien fervently hoped, indeed believed, that there was no divide between belief and reality," says Hillard. "My novel asks the question, 'What if he experienced this borderland first hand?'" Blending historical fact with fantasy, Hillard interweaves Tolkien's philosophy, his role as a World War II spy and imagined conversations between the great author and his friend, C.S. Lewis. Hillard was inspired to write the novel by his experience reading the Lord of the Rings series to his daughters, who enjoyed the books but asked, "Where are the heroines?".}}
