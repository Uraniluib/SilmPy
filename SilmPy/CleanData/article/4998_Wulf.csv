'''Wulf''' (fl. {{TA|2754}}—{{TA|2759}}) was a young nobleman who dwelt in the western borderlands of [[Rohan]]. He was the son of [[Freca]] and it was said that their family had a measure of [[Dunlendings|Dunlendish]] blood.
==History==
Freca attempted to force a marriage between Wulf and the daughter of King [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. When Freca's plan failed, he was slain, and Wulf found himself declared the King's enemy. He fled across the borders into [[Dunland]], where he seems to have been warmly received. For four years, Wulf built up his power in Dunland, and allied himself with Rohan's and [[Gondor]]'s enemies. 

In the year {{TA|2758}}, with Rohan's armies drawn into the east to repel an attack there, Wulf and his allies invaded from the west. They devastated Helm's forces at the [[Fords of Isen]] and overran the country and took [[Edoras]], where Wulf killed Prince [[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]]; he sat in the [[Golden Hall]] and claimed the Kingship of Rohan. 

The exiled King, Helm, was driven into hiding in the mountains. During the [[Long Winter]] Wulf's armies besieged him at [[Hornburg]], and Helm's nephew, [[Fréaláf]] at [[Dunharrow]]. Helm and his second son died of the cold. In the spring, Helm was avenged by Fréaláf, who led a small party into Edoras and killed 'King' Wulf in {{TA|2759}}. With help from [[Gondor]], Fréaláf cleared Wulf's followers from Rohan, and succeeded his uncle Helm to become its tenth rightful King.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>
