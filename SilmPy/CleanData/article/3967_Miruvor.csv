'''Miruvor''' and '''miruvórë''' was, or were, a type of cordial used by the [[Valar]] and the [[Elves]].

''Miruvórë'' was the nectar of the [[Valar]] made from [[Yavanna]]'s flowers, poured during their festivals in [[Valinor]].<ref>{{RGEO|Namarie}}</ref> In her lament, [[Galadriel]] recalled that "The years have passed like swift draughts of the ''sweet mead''".<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

The name ''Miruvor'' refers to a reviving cordial of the [[Elves]] in [[Rivendell]], a liquor with the power to grant renewed vigour and strength. Miruvor was clear and colourless, with a pleasant fragrance. It was possibly a different substance, an imitation, to ''Miruvórë'', and perhaps named after it.  

[[Elrond]] gave a flask of the "Cordial of Imladris" to [[Gandalf]] before the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] departed on their southward journey. Gandalf used this drink to revitalize themselves on [[Caradhras]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> 

Other [[races]], such as the [[Dúnedain]] and even the [[Orcs]] possessed drinks with similar properties, but miruvor was known to be the most potent of these cordials.
==Etymology==
''miruvor'' is [[Sindarin]], said to be a "form taken by borrowed [[Quenya]] word" ''miruvórë'', generally held to mean "precious juice" or "thought of as precious drink (and largely of honey)" (cf. root [[WOR]]).<ref name=PE17/> The Quenya form also appears as ''miruvóre'', explained as "a special wine or cordial".<ref name=WJ/> These form were derived from [[Valarin]] ''[[mirubhōze]]''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, pp. 37-8</ref><ref name=WJ>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref>
==Inspiration==
The invented word goes back to at least [[1915]]. In that early phase of the legendarium, [[Tolkien]] envisioned it as derived from real-life [[Gothic]] elements *''midu'' "mead" + ''wopeis'' "sweet" > miduwopi > miduwodi > misuwosi > Q. miruvore.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xi</ref>
