The Fantasy Role Playing Game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's World

''" Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others... In one hand, he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo."'' - The Fellowship of the Ring.
