'''yunque''' is the number twelve (12) in [[Quenya]].<ref>{{VT|47a}}</ref><ref>{{VT|48a}}</ref>
==Etymology==
It is a composite from ''[[yú]] + [[ence]]'' "double six". [[PQ]] form given also as ''yu-(e)neke'' > ''yunuk(w)''<ref>{{VT|42b}}, p. 24</ref><ref>{{VT|42d}},  p. 31</ref> > ''yunke''.

Note that both ''ence'' and ''yunce'' were later changed to ''enque'' and ''yunque'' due to the influence of ''[[minquë]]''. After that, ''yunque'' is perceived as ''yú + enque''
