__NOTOC__
'''''áre''''' (stem ''ári-''<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}</ref>) means "day, sunlight<ref name="Names">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref>, warmth (especially of the sun)"<ref name="PE17"/> in [[Quenya]].

[[Image:Essë.gif|left]]''Áre'' is also the name in Quenya of the thirty-first letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.  In Quenya this letter was originally named ''Áze'' and represented '''Z''' in written Quenya, but over time the phonemes for "z" and "r" merged, the letter was renamed ''Áre'', and it became superfluous.  This letter was then renamed ''Essë'' and represents '''SS''', but only in written Quenya.<ref name="Names"/>

As noted, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] gave the etymological root of the word for "day" as AR<sup>1</sup>, which means that those words had always the radical letter ''r'' from [[Primitive Quendian]].  However, in [[Appendix E]] he also gave the ancient form of ''Áre'' as ''Áze'', which can not be reconciled with the older etymology since there is no sense in Primitive ''r'' becoming archaic ''z'' and then re-evolving to Quenya ''r'' again.

According to our comprehension of the evolution of Quenya, the ''z'' sound evolved from Primitive ''d'' or Primitive ''s''<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], [http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution from Primitive Elvish to Quenya]</ref> as in [[SRIS]] > ''[[hriz]]'' "to snow".  This, combined with the [[Sindarin]] element ''[[as]]'' of ''[[Asfaloth]]'' (meaning "sunlit foam")<ref name="PE17"/> shows that Tolkien altered the derivation, by changing theoretically the root AR to AS.
