The '''Ship-kings''' was a title given to the great King [[Tarannon Falastur]] and his three successors: [[Eärnil I]], [[Ciryandil]] and [[Hyarmendacil I]]. 

* '''[[Tarannon Falastur]]''' ({{TA|830}}-{{TA|913|n}})
* '''[[Eärnil I]]''' ({{TA|913}}-{{TA|936|n}})
* '''[[Ciryandil]]''' ({{TA|936}}-{{TA|1015|n}}) 
* '''[[Hyarmendacil I|Ciryaher Hyarmendacil I]]''' ({{TA|1015}}-{{TA|1149|n}})

The Ship-kings did much to expand [[Gondor]]'s naval and military might. Between them, they enormously extended the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]]'s control over the southern lands of [[Middle-earth]], including the lands west of the [[Ethir Anduin|Mouths of Anduin]], and as far south as [[Umbar]] and the [[Harad]]. 

Their influence was such that, at the end of the reign of Hyarmendacil I, Gondor had reached a peak of strength and power that it would never again surpass.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
