'''Elostirion''' was the tallest and westernmost of the three [[White Towers]] that stood on the [[Tower Hills]]<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> and that had been built by [[Gil-galad]] for [[Elendil]]. It held [[Elostirion-stone|one]] of the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' of [[Arnor]] which did not communicate with the rest but looked only westward across the Sundering Seas to [[Tol Eressëa]]. It was the last stone of Arnor until it was removed at the very end of the [[Third Age]].<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>
