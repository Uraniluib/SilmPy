'''Rían''' ({{FA|450}} – {{FA|472|n}}) was the daughter of [[Belegund]] of the [[House of Bëor]],<ref name="Beor">{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'', p. 231</ref> the wife of [[Huor]] of the [[House of Hador]], and the mother of [[Tuor]].<ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''(ii) The House of Hador'', p. 234</ref>  Rían was said to be gentle of heart, a lover of trees and wild flowers, and was known as a singer and maker of songs.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 34</ref>

==History==
Rían was born in {{FA|450}}.<ref>{{GA|144}}</ref>  She was only a young girl when the [[Dagor Bragollach]] erupted and was lost by [[Elves]] and [[Men]] in {{FA|455|n}}.  In the wake of the defeat, her father Belegund became a companion of [[Barahir]], who contested Morgoth's dominion over [[Dorthonion]].  But by {{FA|456|n}}, as Morgoth tightened his grip upon the land, Rían was led to safety with the other women and children by [[Emeldir]], the wife of Barahir.<ref name="GA159">{{GA|159}}</ref> The refugees eventually reached [[Dor-lómin]] by way of [[Brethil]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

In {{FA|472}}, Rían wedded [[Huor]] of the [[House of Hador|House of Marach]],<ref name="GA218">{{GA|218}}</ref> whose brother [[Húrin]] was married to Rían's cousin [[Morwen]].<ref name="Beor"/>  They were married but two months when Huor joined [[Húrin]] and left to fight in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref>

In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad Huor was slain in the rearguard of King [[Turgon]].  His body, along with that of many Elves and Men, went into a great hill in the midst of [[Anfauglith]] and thereafter this mound was called the [[Haudh-en-Nirnaeth]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

Rían, having heard no word of her husband's fate, went into the wild seeking tidings.  She gave birth to a son, [[Tuor]], and committed him to the care of the Elves of [[Mithrim]].  Rían made her way to Haudh-en-Nirnaeth and died of grief upon the mound.<ref name="Turin"/>   She was only 22 years old when she died.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an early version of the ''Grey Annals'' the wife of Belegund and Rían were in [[Hithlum]] when the Dagor Bragollach occurred and thus they did not have to escape from Dorthonion.  This was superseded by the story of Emeldir and her escape with the women and children from the highlands.<ref>{{GA|159|note}}</ref>

In the ''Grey Annals'' the year of Rían's marriage to Huor was {{FA|471}} in one paragraph,<ref>{{GA|216}}</ref> yet in the year {{FA|472|n}} it is said that they wedded in the first days of spring and that Huor was summoned to battle two months later.<ref name="GA218"/>  In ''The Silmarillion'' the latter version was used.
