'''Cats''' were animals that lived in [[Arda]].

==History==
Other than use as company, for which the [[Hobbits]] and [[Bree-men|Bree-folk]] used pets,<ref name="RitD"/><ref name="Sign"/> cats were used for the hunt<ref name="XR"/> and for spying.<ref name="UTI7"/> They were soft-footed,<ref name="XR">{{TT|Journey}}</ref> keensighted<ref name="Journey"/> and agile.<ref name="Cirith">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>

===The Cats of Berúthiel===
{{main|Cats of Queen Berúthiel}}
In the late ninth and possibly early tenth century of the [[Third Age]], [[Berúthiel]], wife of [[Tarannon]], King of Gondor, kept cats, nine black and one white. The marriage of Tarannon and Berúthiel was not a pleasant one: his love for the [[Belegaer|Sea]] drove her mad. She hated all making, all colours and elaborate adornment, and set her cats to spy on everyone, learning their secrets. Berúthiel conversed with the cats and read their mind and memory. She even set the white cat to spy on the others, to torment them. Berúthiel's reign of terror came to an end when Tarannon put her  and her cats on a ship and set it adrift. It was last seen passing [[Umbar]].<ref name="UTI7">{{UT|Istari}}, note 7</ref> 

All memory to them was erased (and the [[Book of the Kings]]), though legends of the cats and their ability to spy remain.<ref name="UTI7"/><ref name="Journey">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

===Other cats===

Though there are no other cats that play a large role in history, some are mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] folklore (for example, the Hobbit poem ''[[Cat (poem)|Cat]]''<ref name=Cat>{{ATB|12}}</ref>). [[Bob]], the ostler of the [[Prancing Pony]], had a cat. After [[Frodo Baggins]] sang ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'' (in which the ostler of an unnamed inn had a tipsy cat that played a five stringed fiddle), several patrons suggested that he had to do the same.<ref name="Sign">{{FR|Sign}}</ref> Similarly, a cat, or "four-legs", was part of an old [[Riddle-game|riddle]] [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] asked [[Gollum]].<ref name="RitD">{{H|Riddles}}</ref> 

==Etymology==

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "cat" is ''miog''; ''miaug'' or ''miog'' is "tom cat"; and ''miaulin'' is "she cat".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 57</ref>

The [[Qenya]] word for a "kitten" is ''tis''.<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 20</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Perhaps the most important cat in the [[legendarium]] was [[Tevildo]], the Prince of Cats. Mentioned only in early writings, Tevildo was a demonic servant of Melko, who would eventually be replaced by [[Sauron]]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', "[[The Music of the Ainur (Book of Lost Tales)|The Music of the Ainur]]", page 52</ref>. He is the principal antagonist in ''[[The Tale of Tinuviel]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', "[[The Tale of Tinuviel]]"</ref>

==Other fiction==
[[Tinker]] is a cat appearing in ''[[Roverandom]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Roverandom]]''</ref>

==Inspiration==
Especially in the case of Berúthiel and Tevildo, cats in Middle-earth are portrayed in a negative light. It could be argued that Tolkien was not a cat-person. When a cat-breeder asked permission to use names from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' for her cats, Tolkien replied to [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]]: 
{{quote|I fear that to me Siamese cats belong to the fauna of Mordor, but you need not tell the cat breeder that.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Letter 219]]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 219]] (dated [[14 October|October 14]], [[1959]])</ref>}}

==Portrayal in Adaptations == 

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Cats are found throughout Middle-earth, especially in Bree-land. There is a "cat lady" who has a house full of cats. Lore-masters can also have a non-combat cat pet.
