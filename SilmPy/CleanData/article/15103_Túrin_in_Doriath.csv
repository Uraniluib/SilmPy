'''Túrin in Doriath''' is the fifth chapter of ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.

==Synopsis==
For a little while, [[Túrin|Túrin’s]] time in [[Doriath]] was merry, and he befriended an [[Elves|elf]] of the wood, [[Nellas]], who watched over him under the guidance of [[Melian]]. And even when Túrin’s thoughts turned beyond merriness, Nellas would watch over him to see the malice of [[Morgoth]] show as much that Túrin would wish for would come to ruin.

Túrin still had the friendship of [[Beleg]], from whom he learned much woodlore and the handling of swords, and tidings would come to him of [[Morwen]] and [[Nienor|Niënor]] from [[Dor-lómin]] and how their life had become easier in the grey north. When Túrin was seventeen the messengers did not return from Dor-lómin, and tales of dark rumours spread of Morgoth’s waxing power. So Túrin came before [[Thingol]] and asked his leave to free his mother from the north, to which the Elven King gave counsel to remain and guard the marches of Doriath with fresh sword and the ancient [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin|Dragon-helm]].

Túrin remained in Doriath and, with Beleg, made a name dreaded by the [[Orcs]]. For three years he fought until one summer he returned to [[Menegroth]]. There he was met by [[Saeros]], counsel to the King, who had ever been an adversary of Túrin for he thought [[Men]] lowly. Saeros made light of Túrin’s deeds and said of the women of Dor-lómin ''“they run like deer only in their hair.”'' This enraged Túrin and he tossed a cup at Saeros, marring his face.

Saeros followed Túrin the next morning and came upon him in the wild to kill him, but Túrin bested him and made him run through the wood naked. Soon many Elves witnessed the chase but Saeros in his terror leapt a gorge and slipped, falling to his death, and Túrin was asked to come to justice in Menegroth. He refused, saying ''“I will not seek the King Thingol’s pardon”'' for he felt guiltless and so left Doriath at once.

Thingol, in coming to his judgement, heard even Nellas’ testament – for she had seen Saeros leap at Túrin to kill him, and Túrin was pardoned and seen as innocent. Yet the Man had departed and Beleg asked to search out his friend in the wild, but only if he could choose a sword from the King's armoury. He chose the dark sword [[Anglachel]], a choice Melian thought short sighted, and sought Túrin across [[Beleriand]].
