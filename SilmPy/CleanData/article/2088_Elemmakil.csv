'''Elemmakil''', one of the [[Noldor]], was the Captain of the Guard in the secret passageway to [[Gondolin]] when [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] appeared.  Elemmakil was amazed that his friend Voronwë would bring a mortal man with him and announced that he should, by law, slay him.  Voronwë and Tuor answered that they came at the command of [[Ulmo]].  Elemmakil then guided the two through the Seven Gates of the [[Orfalch Echor]], until he delivered them unto [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]], then serving as the Warden of the Great Gate.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
