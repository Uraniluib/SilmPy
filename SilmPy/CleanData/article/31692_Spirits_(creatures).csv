==Groups==

===Ainur===

*''Main article: [[Ainur]]''

Before [[Eä]], [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] created the spirits known as the [[Ainur]], the Holy Ones. The greater were called [[Valar]] and the lesser [[Maiar]].<ref name=SII>{{S|II}}</ref>

Some of the spirits were associated with a certain [[Wikipedia:Classical element|element]], or physical phenomenon: 
*''Air spirits'': Spirits shaped like [[hawks]] and [[eagles]] delivered messages to [[Manwë]] as he sat in his throne in [[Ilmarin]] upon [[Taniquetil]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>
*''Fire spirits'': The Maia [[Arien]] is said to have been "''from the beginning a spirit of fire''".<ref name=S11>{{S|11}}</ref> Melkor seduced some of the fire spirits, which became known as the [[Balrogs]].<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>
*''Water spirits'': A host of spirits followed [[Ulmo]] to maintain the waters of [[Arda]], of whom the Maiar [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]] were the greatest.<ref>{{S|1}} ("''Salmar came with [Ulmo] to Arda, [...] and Ossë and Uinen also, to whom he gave the government of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas, and many other spirits beside.''")</ref> Perhaps [[Salmar]], and [[Goldberry]] and the [[River-woman]] were such water spirits.
*''Shadow spirits'': It is told that [[Morgoth]] sent "''spirits of shadow''" against [[Tilion]], as he hated the light of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]].<ref name=S11/>

===Evil spirits===

All Ainur originally adhered to Eru, but the Vala [[Morgoth|Melkor]] became corrupted and fell from the grace of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]].<ref name=SII/> Melkor "''gathered to himself spirits out of the voids of Eä that he had perverted to his service''", and these became known as the [[Úmaiar]] or [[demons]].<ref>{{MR|P2}}, pp. 53 (§17), 79 (commentary to §30)</ref>

In the late [[Third Age]], spirits of "''evil vigilance''" are said to have abode in the [[Two Watchers]].<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref> The [[Barrow-wights]] are furthermore said to be evil spirits who had entered in deserted mounds, stirring the bones of the dead.<ref name=Eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==Names==

In [[Quenya]], a collective name for the spirits is ''[[ëalar]]''.<ref name=MR>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 165 (commentary on § 18)</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In an early version of Tolkien's mythology, tiny, gleaming spirits appear dancing in [[An Evening in Tavrobel|a poem]] about [[Tavrobel]].<ref>{{ATB|A2}}, pp. 284-5></ref>
