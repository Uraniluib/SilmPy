'''''Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast''''' (an [[Old English]] title, rendered in modern English as ''The Last Voyage of Eärendel'') is an early poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (according to [[Christopher Tolkien]] "the first of the [[Legendarium|mythology]]"<ref name="LT271">{{HM|LT2}}, "[[The Tale of Eärendel]]", p. 271</ref>). It is published in full in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''<ref name="LT">{{HM|LT2}}, "[[The Tale of Eärendel]]"</ref>.

The poem was originally titled '''''The Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star''''' (with the Old English version ''Scipfæreld Éarendeles Ǽfensteorran'') and was written at [[Phoenix Farm]] in [[1914#September|September 1914]]<ref name="Bio71">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', p. 71</ref><ref name="Gedling">Andrew H. Morton, John Hayes, ''[[Tolkien's Gedling|Tolkien's Gedling - 1914]]''</ref>. Under this title Tolkien read the poem at the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Essay Club in the November of the same year, as referenced in [[Letter 2]]. By the latest revision, written at an unknown date but "substantially later"<ref name="LT" /> than the first, the newer title was given in its Old English form only.

It was the first poem on the subject of [[Eärendil]] and describes his voyage from "[[Beleriand|Westerland]]", through "the darkling [[Valinor|West]]" and ultimately [[Void|beyond the world]] itself<ref name="LT" />. The fourth verse describes the movements of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] in a way which anticipates cosmology of the ''[[The Hiding of Valinor]]'' and the ''[[Tale of the Sun and the Moon]]''<ref name="LT" />.
