'''Tulkas''' was a [[Valar|Vala]]. He was the most warlike of the Valar and the spouse of [[Nessa]].
==Attributes==
Tulkas was so strong and quick that he needed no weapon or steed. He delighted in deeds of prowess and strength such as wrestling and fighting. But he was not dreadful; he laughed loudly in sport and war and his anger dispelled darkness and clouds.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref><ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> 

He was a hardy friend and slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive.
He was however mindless and did not learn from the past; always quick in action, he was not good in counselling.<ref name=vala/><ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 206 §7</ref>

His flesh was ruddy and his hair and beard golden.<ref name=vala/>

==History==
Tulkas was the last of the [[Ainur]] to descend into [[Arda]], 1499 [[Valian Years]] after the arrival of the other Ainur. He heard of their [[First War]] with [[Melkor]] and came to them from the far heavens. But for his arrival, the Dark Lord might have defeated the Valar. <ref>{{S|III}}</ref> Hearing the sound of Tulkas' laughter and beholding his wrath, Melkor fled before him, and the [[Spring of Arda]] was begun.<ref name=s1/> 

After the [[Two Lamps]] were erected and the Valar had made their first dwelling at [[Almaren]], Tulkas wedded [[Nessa]] in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had come.

When at last the [[Elves|first Children of Ilúvatar]] awoke, the Valar took council regarding the matter of Melkor. At length it was decided that, for the sake of the Elves, the Valar should regain guardianship of the world and remove Melkor. Tulkas was glad of this decision. In the [[War for the Sake of the Elves]], after a long siege at [[Utumno]], it was Tulkas who wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face. Tulkas bound Melkor with the enchanted chain [[Angainor]], forged by [[Aulë]]. For a while the world was free from Melkor's influence.

When Melkor repented of his actions and was pardoned by [[Manwë]], Tulkas was disappointed with this decision, ever distrustful of Melkor. But having fought Melkor in the name of authority, he could not rebel himself, and accepted Manwë's decision.

Tulkas also tended to be impatient; before the [[Awakening of the Elves]] he urged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the [[Darkening of Valinor]] he also hurried [[Fëanor]] to take a decision about surrendering the [[Silmarils]]. Tulkas and [[Oromë]] searched in vain for Melkor, unable to penetrate the unlight cast by [[Ungoliant]].

It is said that in the [[Dagor Dagorath]], Tulkas will once more oppose [[Melkor]], and will directly fight him in the battle and play a large role in his defeat. The victor is unknown, as it will be supposedly by the hand of [[Túrin]] that Melkor is slain once and for all.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 333</ref>
