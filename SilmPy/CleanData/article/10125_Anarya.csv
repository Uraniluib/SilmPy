'''Anarya''' (''[[Sun#Names of the Sun|anar]]'' = sun) was [[Quenya]] for ''Sunday''. It was, however, the second day (not the first or last, as in modern calendars) of the [[Eldar|Eldarin]] six-day week (and in the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] week). Its [[Sindarin]] name was '''Oranor'''.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
