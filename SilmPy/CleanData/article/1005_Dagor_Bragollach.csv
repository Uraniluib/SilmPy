The '''Dagor Bragollach''' ([[Sindarin]] for '''"Battle of Sudden Flame"''') was the fourth battle of the Wars of [[Beleriand]].

== The Battle Opens ==

It began when [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]], which had held for four hundred years. On a winter's night, Morgoth sent out rivers of flame, consuming [[Ard-galen]], which was renamed [[Anfauglith]]. Many elves perished as they fled from these flames, from the fire and the smoke. His armies of [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]], led by [[Glaurung]] first of the [[Urulóki]], overran the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], and slew [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]]. [[Maglor]]'s horsemen were burnt alive on the plain of [[Lothlann]], and [[Maglor's Gap]] was taken, giving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand itself. Maglor retreated with heavy losses to [[Himring]], where he helped defend the city of [[Maedhros]].

== East Beleriand Overrun ==

The [[Pass of Aglon]] was also breached, and [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] fled south of [[Doriath]] to [[Nargothrond]]. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain forests of [[Rerir|Mount Rerir]], and defiled [[Helevorn|Lake Helevorn]], ravaging [[Thargelion]] and marching far into [[East Beleriand]], filling the lands of the [[Gelion]] with fire and terror. [[Caranthir]] fled to [[Amon Ereb]], where he and [[Amrod]] built defenses, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern border. The Orcs did not come into Taur-im-Duinath or Ossiriand.

[[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] in the [[Pass of Sirion]] in the West held under [[Orodreth]], second son of [[Finarfin]] (Elven-king of the [[Noldor]] in [[Aman]]), and Orodreth's eldest brother King [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] came north from [[Nargothrond]] with a large army. However, they were ambushed by a large army of Morgoth's forces at the [[Fen of Serech]]. [[Gelmir_(son_of_Guilin)|Gelmir]] was lost during that battle.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> The Noldor now found themselves trapped, and Finrod would have been killed but for a sortie by [[Barahir]], who descended from [[Dorthonion]] and rescued the [[Elves|Elven]] lord. It was this deed which later earned Barahir the ring of Finrod which would become known as the [[Ring of Barahir]].

Finrod and his folk fled south to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued defending Dorthonion. The mountain forts of the [[Ered Wethrin]] around [[Hithlum]] also held, although barely.

== The Battle Ends: Fingolfin's Duel ==

Thus the Siege was broken, the [[Sons of Fëanor]] scattered, and the forces of Morgoth roamed at will throughout the north.

When [[Fingolfin]], the High King of the Noldor, learned of the losses of so many Noldor, he rode in anger across the dust of Anfauglith and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the doors of [[Angband]] itself, they fought a great duel. Fingolfin's sword, [[Ringil]], wounded Morgoth seven times. Yet, he was felled by Morgoth's hammer, Grond, and slain by Morgoth's mighty foot.

The folk of [[Barahir]] fought foot by foot for their lands, refusing to retreat from the attacking forces, and Morgoth relentlessly pursued them to the death until very few remained. So great was his wrath against them that [[Dorthonion]] was turned into a twisted land of dread and such dark enchantment that even Orcs would not enter it unless need drove them.

Despite Morgoth's crushing victory, his foes soon regrouped, and in several areas formed strongholds and defensive positions against his Orcs. This, along with the theft of a Silmaril from Morgoth by Lúthien, renewed the morale of the folk of the West, leading to the creation of the [[Union of Maedhros]], a final alliance of Men and Elves bent on removing Morgoth from Arda once and for all. Their efforts would not be successful however in this coming fight, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].
