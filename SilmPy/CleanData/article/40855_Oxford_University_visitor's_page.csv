'''Oxford University visitor's page''' refers to a sheet (8" x 9.5") removed from a visitor's book at the [[University of Oxford]], stamped [[20 October]] [[1911]]. The page features signatures of Oxford University undergraduates, and the names of their respective colleges. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] added his signature about three quarters of the way down the page, and wrote his college, "[[University of Oxford#Exeter College|Exeter]]" beside his signature.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.benl.ebay.be/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=110928410792|articlename=JRR TOLKIEN Extremely Rare Signed Oxford University Visitor's Autograph Page (Item number: 110928410792)|dated=|website=[http://www.benl.ebay.be/ eBay.be]|accessed=2 August 2012}}</ref>
