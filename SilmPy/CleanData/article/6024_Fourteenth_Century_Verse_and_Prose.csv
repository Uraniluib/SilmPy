'''''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose''''' is a book by [[Kenneth Sisam]], containing a glossary by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The glossary was also independently published as "[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]".

==1st Edition 1921==
''A Middle English Vocabulary'' was not published until 1922, but after publication some copies were bound with 1st impressions of Sisam’s book. They were intended to be published together, but Tolkien’s contribution was delayed. ''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose'' was also issued separately without Tolkien's glossary.

There is a possibility of a 1933 impression of this book with a grey coloured dustwrapper rather than the later tan coloured one.

The book was reprinted in [[1923]], [[1924]], [[1927]], and [[1933]]. Copies dated [[1925]] and [[1928]] have also been reported.

The copies in a dark red binding include Tolkien’s glossary, whereas copies in a blue coloured binding do not.

The corrigenda printed on the last page of 1922 copies of ''A Middle English Vocabulary'' were incorporated into the text of the 1923 impression of ''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose''.

==1st Edition, 6th Impression, 1937==

The 6th impression corrected previously issued impressions.

''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose'' was also issued seperately without Tolkien's glossary.

Reprinted in [[1944]], [[1946]], [[1948]] and [[1950]].

Copies in a dark red binding include Tolkien’s glossary, whereas copies in a blue coloured binding do not.  The only exception to this is the 10th impression of 1950, where both were issued in the blue binding. Copies without the glossary were issued in a grey coloured dustwrapper of similar design.
