'''Bombur''' was one of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  Bombur's distinguishing characteristic was his size for he was the fattest of the thirteen Dwarves.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>  After the death of Smaug, Bombur lived at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother [[Bofur]] and his cousin [[Bifur]].<ref name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref>   Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  His birth year is also unknown.  However, from [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years"<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that after Thorin had been captured, [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>  Since Fíli was born in {{TA|2859}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Bombur's birth between 2809 and {{TA|2763|n}}, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.   Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Bombur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  When Bilbo jerked open his door the four fell on top of one another, with Thorin on the bottom and fat Bombur on top.  Bombur wore a pale green hood and asked for pork-pie and salad for his refreshment.  When Thorin later called for music, Bombur played a drum.<ref name="Party"/>

Despite his size, before the Trolls could capture Bombur he fought like mad.  Because of the trouble he caused them the Trolls put him near their fire.<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

Running from the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] through their tunnels, Bombur carried Bilbo for part of the way, although he grumbled about it as he staggered with sweat dripping from his nose.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>

In the glade of the [[Wargs]] Bombur shared a pine tree with Bifur, Bofur, and Thorin.<ref name="Pan">{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up.  Gandalf had told Bombur to arrive last and alone because he was the fattest, but the offended Dwarf had refused to wait.<ref name="Queer">{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Bombur's most notable "adventure" occurred at the [[Enchanted River]].  Beorn had warned them about its water<ref name="Queer"/> and they did try to cross without touching it, but due to the charge of the deer, Bombur fell into the river.  The company threw him a rope and he caught it, but upon landing he fell into an enchanted sleep.  For six days the company took turns carrying the heavy slumbering Dwarf.  When finally awake he had forgotten everything since the quest began and lamented waking up to no food, especially since his dreams had been about a great forest feast.  After a day of walking Bombur had had enough and refused to take another step.

It was then that the first of the feasts of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] appeared north of the path.  Bombur was for rushing to it but was restrained by the caution of the others.  When they did attempt to enter the feasts everything vanished and eventually all of the Dwarves except Thorin were captured by the spiders.  After the spiders had strung up the Dwarves, Bombur's fatness was again a problem for it attracted the attention of one of the creatures who bit him on the nose.  Bombur kicked the spider, who would have killed him had Bilbo not intervened.  Despite this activity Bombur was nearly exhausted; when freed he fell off his branch and luckily had his fall cushioned by leaves.<ref name="Flies"/>

After the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] both Bombur was found to be asleep or senseless.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

While the rest of the company climbed up to the "doorstep" on the side of the Lonely Mountain, Bombur and Bofur remained in the valley to tend to the ponies.  While Bofur was willing to ascend by rope for changes of the guard, Bombur demurred, claiming that he would either grow dizzy or the rope would break.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>  However, when Smaug came roaring out to scour the mountainside Bombur's reluctance vanished and he was hauled up the cliff.<ref name="Inside">{{H|Inside}}</ref>

Although Bombur supported Thorin's decision to defy the Elves and Men and withstand a siege, he felt it was a "sorry business altogether" and deemed Thorin "ever a dwarf with a stiff neck".  Wishing for a strong drink and a soft bed, Bombur was easily convinced when Bilbo offered to take his turn as watchman.  Bombur did sleep and thanked Bilbo later when the Hobbit woke him up after midnight.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref>

Bombur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
At [[Rivendell]] in December, {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bombur was still alive and living in Erebor.  In fact, Bombur appeared to have used some of his wealth to increase his girth – he was unable to move alone from couch to table and required the aid of six young Dwarves to lift him.<ref name="Meetings"/>  Given his age and immobility it is doubtful that Bombur fought in the [[Battle of Dale]].

==Etymology==
Bombur, or ''Bumburr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "the Swollen One".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the early manuscript fragments of ''The Hobbit'', Bombur produced a drum from ''nowhere'',<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 36</ref> whereas in the published text he just produced it ''from the hall''.<ref name="Party"/>  [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') said that in the earliest phase Tolkien had added fairy tale touches of Dwarven magic to emphasize the uncanny, other-worldly nature of the Dwarves as opposed to Bilbo's ordinariness.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, (iii) ''Dwarven Magic'', p. 54</ref>

On the wet night before meeting the Trolls the prepublication version had Bombur and Bofur failing to light a fire and quarrelling about it, with Dori and Nori getting into a fight.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref>  In the published version Tolkien added a comment that [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]] were especially good at making a fire, made them the two who could not do it that night, and had them start fighting.<ref name="Mutton"/>

Originally, when Bombur needed propping up in [[Mirkwood]] after being cut from the spiders' webbing, it was ''his cousins'' Bifur and Bofur who provided support.<ref>{{HH|Mirkwood}}, p. 313</ref>  In the published story this was changed to Bombur's cousin Bifur and brother Bofur.<ref name="Flies"/>  Also, in the earlier version, when [[Smaug]] first came out and the Dwarves in the valley had to be hauled up to the [[Back Door]], Bifur cried out to save Bombur and Bofur, who were both his ''brothers''.<ref>{{HH|Conversations}}</ref>  In the published text Bifur cried out for his two ''cousins''.<ref name="Inside"/>

In Tolkien's unfinished [[1960]] rewrite of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur, Bofur and Bombur were Thorin's attendants.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[A Well-Planned Party]]", p. 774</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] assumes this made them either courtiers or honor-guard.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[Arrival in Rivendell]]", note 32</ref>  Although this relationship did not appear in the published story, it may be noted that Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur arrived at Bag End with Thorin<ref name="Party"/> and the same three Dwarves climbed the same pine tree with Thorin in the glade of the Wargs.<ref name="Pan"/>
