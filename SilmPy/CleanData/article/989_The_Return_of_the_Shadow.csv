'''''The Return of the Shadow''''' is the first volume of the ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'' and the sixth volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. It is a history of the creation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', a fascinating study of Tolkien's great masterpiece, from its inception to the end of the first volume, ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. In ''The Return of the Shadow'' (the abandoned title of the first volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'') we see how Bilbo's 'magic' ring evolved into the supremely dangerous [[One Ring|Ruling Ring]] of the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]]; and the precise, and astonishingly unforeseen, moment when a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] first rode into [[the Shire]]. The character of the hobbit called [[Trotter]] (afterwards [[Strider]] or [[Aragorn]]) is developed, though his true identity seems to be an insoluble problem. Frodo's companions undergo many changes of name and personality; and other major figures appear in unfamiliar guises: a sinister [[Treebeard]], in league with the Enemy, and a ferocious, malevolent [[Farmer Maggot]]. This book comes complete with reproductions of the first maps and facsimile pages from the earlier manuscripts.

The title page contains an inscription in Tengwar:

''In the Return of the Shadow are traced the first forms of the story of the Lord of the Rings; herein the journey of the hobbit who bore the Great Ring, at first named Bilbo but afterwards Frodo, is followed from Hobbiton in the Shire through the Old Forest to Weathertop and Rivendell, and ends in this volume before the tomb of Balin, the Dwarf-Lord of Moria.''
