'''Tales from the Perilous Realm''' is a [[1992]] radio series of ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'', adapted by [[Brian Sibley]], produced by John Taylor and aired on [[BBC|BBC Radio 5]]. It is often called an [[audiobooks|audiobook]], though it is not.

==Synopsis==
The series contains the four stories in ''Tales from the Perilous Realm'': ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'', ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' is the dramatization of Tom's scenes with the four Hobbits in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', rather than a retelling of the events of the poems ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]''. Brian Sibley had expressed some pity in not including it in his [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio adaptation]], and decided to include it here[http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html].
