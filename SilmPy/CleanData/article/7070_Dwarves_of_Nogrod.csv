The '''Dwarves of Nogrod''' were the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] House who dwelled at  [[Nogrod]] in the [[First Age]].

==History==
During the [[Years of the Trees]] the western [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke from beneath [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] creating the lines of the [[Broadbeams]] and the [[Firebeards]]. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.

They were initially friendly to the [[Elves]] of Beleriand, renowned as craftsmen and jewelers, such as [[Gamil Zirak]] whose works were to be found in the treasuries of King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref> and [[Telchar]] known for the forging of weapons. Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, perhaps also those of Nogrod, aided the [[Noldor]] in the building of [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=doriath/><Ref>{{S|13}}</ref>

Dwarves of Nogrod, as well as their kinsmen of Belegost, participated in the [[Union of Maedhros]] supplying them with soldiers and weapons.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

Some craftsmen from Nogrod stayed in [[Menegroth]] and were asked by King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] to set the [[Silmaril]] in the [[Nauglamir]]. But they coveted the Nauglamir they made and killed Thingol in his treasury, and fled, only to be slaughtered by the avenging Elves who killed all but two. The survivors returned to Nogrod, and lied to their kinsmen saying that Thingol refused to pay the craftsmen and for their work and killed them. 

Although the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] refused to aid them, they formed a great host which passed over [[Sarn Athrad]] intimidating the [[Sindar]] who fled before them. In the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|sack the Menegroth]] they ravaged the Caves and Thingol's treasures. But on their return home they were hunted down by [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]] and killed by his army of [[Green-elves]] and a group of [[Ents]] at the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] as they were crossing the river.<ref name=doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

After the end of the [[First Age]], around {{SA|40}}, the power and wealth of Khazad-dûm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref name="Durin"/> However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>
