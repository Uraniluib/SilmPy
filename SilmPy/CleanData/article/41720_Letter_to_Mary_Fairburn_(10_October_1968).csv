*'''Contents:''' Miss Fairburn had written to Tolkien, expressing a disappointment that her illustrations would not be used for an illustrated edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In his letter on 10 October, Tolkien replies that he is "''distressed''" learning about her poor financial situation, but that "''your ill fortune [in the matter of the illustrations] . . . is mainly due to the present situation in the book world. [[Allen and Unwin]] have found that ‘The Lord of the Rings’ in any form is now so expensive that any attempt to produce it in a special or more sumptuous form is [bound to be] a failure''". He also writes that he is "''reluctantly sending back to you the pictures I have received''", since Fairburn had written that she would give them to a friend as payment for a debt. However, Fairburn had mentioned three other pictures (including portrayals of the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Dead Marshes]]), not seen yet by Tolkien, and he therefore adds: "''they sound most interesting, especially The Old Forest''", wanting to take a look at them. In the middle of writing his letter, Tolkien spoke with [[Rayner Unwin]] on the phone, mentioning Fairburn and her pictures. Unwin "''was not so decisive as I had expected, & was evidently ready to 'consider' an illustrated edition''". But he adds that pen-and-ink illustrations would be "''much more likely to prove publishable''" and that she should not be too hopeful about a swift progress. Finally, he writes that he is sending her £50 in the letter,<ref group=note>As of 2012, worth circa £1,250.</ref> "''As a gift''", and he does not want her to mention this in any reply.
