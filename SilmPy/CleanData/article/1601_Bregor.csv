'''Bregor''' ({{FA|359}} - {{FA|448|n}}) was the second [[Lord of Ladros]].
__NOTOC__
== History ==
Born into the [[House of Bëor]], Bregor was the eldest child and only son of [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)|Boromir]]; his sisters were [[Andreth]] and [[Beril]]. 

In total, Bregor fathered five children who were three daughters: [[Bregil]], [[Hirwen]] and [[Gilwen]], and two sons: [[Bregolas]] and [[Barahir]]. 

When Bregor was [[First Age 410|51 years]] old, the region of [[Ladros]] in [[Dorthonion]] was given to his House, and his father became its first Lord.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 228-9</ref> Bregor became the head of his House and Lord of Ladros after the passing of his father in {{FA|432|n}}. He ruled his people peacefully for sixteen years until his death, when Bregor was succeeded by his eldest son, Bregolas.

Through his many descendants, Bregor was a direct ancestor of the great heroes of men, [[Beren]], [[Húrin]], [[Túrin]], and [[Tuor]].<ref name=WJBeor/> His weapon was a famed [[Bow of Bregor|bow]] which became a heirloom of the [[House of Bëor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', created in the 1930s,<ref>{{WJ|P1}}</ref> Bëor was followed by his sons [[Bregolas]] and [[Barahir]].  After publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' a new genealogy for the [[House of Bëor]] was made in the 1950s and at that time four generations (Baran, Boron, Boromir, and ''Bregor'') were inserted after Bëor, with Bregor the father of Bregolas and Barahir.<ref name=WJBeor>{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor''</ref>
