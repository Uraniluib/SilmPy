{{blockquote|Dear Daniel,<br/><br/>It is a long time since July 20th; but better (I hope) late than never to do what I should have done before being immersed in other matters : to thank you for your delightful dinner in St Johnâ€™s, and especially for your forbearance and great kindness to me personally. It proved a turning point! I suffered no ill effects whatsoever, and have since been able to dispense with most of the diet taboos I had to observe for some six months.<br/><br/>I look forward to the next A.E. dinner, and hope that you will be present.<br/><br/>Yours ever,<br/><br/>Ronald Tolkien.}}
