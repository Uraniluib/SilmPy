The '''Dead Marshes''' were reeking wetlands that lay north-west of the [[Dagorlad]] and south-east of the [[Emyn Muil]].  The marshes were an endless network of pools and soft mires filled with water-courses, and in the dark waters could be seen [[Dead faces|the dead]] from battles of long ago.<ref name="Passage">{{TT|IV2}}</ref>

==History==
In the year {{SA|3434}} the host of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] fought the forces of [[Mordor]] in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  During the battle on the plains more than half of the Elves of [[Lothlórien]] under the command of King [[Amdír]] were driven into the Dead Marshes.<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref>  After the battle many of the slain were buried outside of the marshy area but over time (in the [[Third Age]]) the Marshes had grown and swallowed the graves.<ref name="Passage"/>

In {{TA|1944}} King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] was caught by a surprise attack by the [[Wainriders]] upon the Dagorlad.  When the King and his guard were destroyed many of the confused soldiers of Gondor were driven by the attackers into the Dead Marshes.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>  However, after [[Eärnil II]] won the [[Battle of the Camp]], those of the [[Wainriders]] who were not slain in the fight were themselves driven into the Dead Marshes and there perished.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

At the [[Council of Elrond]] (on 25 October {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>) [[Aragorn]] revealed that he had found and captured [[Gollum]] the year before along the skirts of the Dead Marshes.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

After [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] had captured Gollum in the [[Emyn Muil]] (on 29 March {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name="Great"/>), he revealed that he had found a hidden way across the Marshes.<ref>{{TT|IV1}}</ref>  The three took Gollum’s passage, where they saw candles and lights dancing about.  Frodo was mesmerized by the lights and tried to reach out and touch the faces of the dead, at the bottom of the marshes.  Gollum told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he had once tried to eat them.<ref name="Passage"/>

==Inspiration==
In ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', Tolkien speculated that the description of the Dead Marshes may have been based on his personal experience in [[World War I]], specifically, the [[Battle of the Somme]].<ref>{{L|226}}</ref> When it rained, blast craters in no-man's land would become a series of pools or lakes with bodies of dead soldiers, from both sides, floating in them.
