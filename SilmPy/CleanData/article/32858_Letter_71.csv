==Summary==
Letters from Christopher had poured in and Tolkien envied his son's stationing in Africa, which stirred a curious sense of reminiscence in him.  Tolkien had not slept, partly due to deafening traffic but also because of his absorption in [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].  The chapter on [[Shelob]] and [[Cirith Ungol|Kirith Ungol]] had been written several times and took a lot out of him.  Besides working on ''The Lord of the Rings'' he had made a hen-coop and chick-run.

Tolkien hoped Christopher could get more leave to see genuine Africa away from the "lesser servants of [[Mordor]]".  He thought of orcs as real a creation as anything in "realistic" fiction.  In real life they are on both sides.  In allegories good is on one side while various modes of badness are on the other.  In real (exterior) life both sides are a motley alliance of orcs, beasts, demons, plain natural honest men, and angels (but it did make a difference if your captain was orc-like).

Tolkien said he could not stand ''Gaudy Night''.<ref group="notes">By Dorothy Sayers (1935)</ref>  He had followed [[Wikipedia:Lord Peter Wimsey|P. Wimsey]] from his attractive beginnings, but had conceived a loathing of him and his Harriet not surpassed by any other characters in literature known to him.  ''Busman's Honeymoon''<ref group="notes">By Dorothy Sayers (1937)</ref> made him sick.
