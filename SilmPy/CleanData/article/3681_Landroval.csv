'''Landroval''' was one of the [[Eagles]].

==History==
A descendant of [[Thorondor]], it is said that Landroval was his vassal in the [[First Age]] and with his brother [[Gwaihir]] helped him rescue [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from [[Angband]].<ref name=P1>{{WJ|P1}} p. 68</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]] he stayed out of the war for most of the conflict, but he followed his brother to the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where he and his vassals helped turn the tide.

After the Ring was destroyed, Landroval, Gwaihir and [[Meneldor]], flew into [[Mordor]] to retrieve [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from the ruins of [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>
