'''Two-headed Trolls''' might have been a legendary race of [[Trolls]], as [[Gandalf]] once said that "''I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each.''"<ref>{{H|2}}</ref> If Gandalf's statement was not merely a way of speaking, perhaps the two-headed Trolls lived in the [[Ettenmoors]].<ref>See section "Inspiration" below</ref>
==Inspiration==
''Etten'', the first element in ''Ettensmoor'', is a word derived from [[Old English]] ''eōten'' ("giant, troll, ogre").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 183</ref><ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 770</ref> It has been noted that Tolkien "probably thought of an 'ettin' as a troll".<ref>[[Michael D.C. Drout]], "[http://oenewsletter.org/OEN/archive.php/essays/drout37_3/ An Anglo-Saxonist Gets his Fifteen Minutes: or, what happens when the media briefly pay attention]" at [http://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/index.php ''Old English Newsletter'' Online] (accessed 10 March 2011)</ref> Historically, the ''Ettins'' have been represented as similar to giants, but with two heads.{{fact}} It is unknown if [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was aware of this connection between ''Etten'' and the notion of Ettins as trolls or giants with two heads. However, in many other fictional fantasy worlds, the race of Ettin(s) are described as two-headed monsters.<ref>[[Dungeons and Dragons]] (1977), ''Monster Manual''; see further [[Wikipedia:Ettin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ettin (Dungeons & Dragons)]] at Wikipedia</ref><ref>[http://www.wowwiki.com/Ettin Ettin] at [http://www.wowwiki.com World of Warcraft Wiki] (accessed 15 November 2010)</ref>

Commenting on Gandalf's words, [[John D. Rateliff]] has noted that trolls "with multiple heads appear in many stories", especially pointing to [[Wikipedia:George Webbe Dasent|George Webbe Dasent]]'s "[[Wikipedia:Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria Castle]]".<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 99 (note 9)</ref>
