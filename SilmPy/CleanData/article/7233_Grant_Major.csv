'''Grant Major''' ([[1955]]) was the production designer for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]. He oversaw the creation of sets such as [[Rivendell]], [[Hobbiton]], [[Moria]], and others. Realism and detail were a must in transforming [[Middle-earth]] to the screen, without Major's perfectionism the films would have been greatly different.
