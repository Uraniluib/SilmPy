__NOTOC__
'''Drû''' (pl. '''Drúin''', coll. '''Drúath''') is the [[Sindarin]] name for the mysterious people of [[Men]] who became known as the [[Woses]] in the [[Third Age]].
==Usage of plural==
*''Drúin'' is the simple plural of the word. 
*The collective ''Drúath'' was modified as early as the [[First Age]] when it became known that they were enemies of the orcs. Later used to refer to a large number of the Drúedain.
*''[[Drúedain]]'' refers to the race as a whole. 
==Etymology==
This Sindarin word comes from ''[[Drughu]]'' the [[Drúedain]]'s own name for themselves. 

Since [[Elvish]] don't have ''gh'' it was derived as ''drughu > dru'u > druu > drû''
==Examples==
*[[Drúadan]]
*[[Drúwaith]]
==Cognates==
*[[Quenya]] ''[[Rú]]''
