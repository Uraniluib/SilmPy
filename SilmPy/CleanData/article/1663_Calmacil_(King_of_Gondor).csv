'''Calmacil''' ({{TA|1058}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1304|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 246 years) was the eighteenth King of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Calmacil was the son of King [[Atanatar II]] Alcarin and younger brother to [[Narmacil I|Narmacil]]. The two brothers had inherited their father's love for ease and neglect of political matters. His son, [[Minalcar]], was unlike them, a man of great vigour. 

When his indolent older brother Narmacil became King, he bestowed upon Minalcar to be a [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]].

When Narmacil died without heirs in {{TA|1294}}, Calmacil was too old to succeed him as a King<ref name="South"/> so he continued to have his son Minalcar function as Regent<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> until he was properly succeeded after his death.
