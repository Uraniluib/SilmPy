'''The Coming of Túrin into Brethil''' is the thirteenth chapter of ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.

==Synopsis==
After leaving [[Dor-Lómin]], [[Túrin]] travelled southwards towards [[Sirion]]. He saw two choices before him, should he seek his [[Morwen|mother]] and his [[Niënor|sister]]? Or should he continue his desperate plight to find the party of Orcs which had taken his love, [[Finduilas]] captive. However he knew that by such time, both Morwen and Nienor should have reached [[Doriath]] and were safe within the [[Girdle of Melian]].

Therefore Turin continued his search for Finduilas; he travelled through the woods besides [[Ered Wethrin]], and through all the roads that went north to the [[Pass of Sirion]] waiting to attack the Orcs holding Finduilas captive. Upon finding that all of trails had been washed away, he passed down the river [[Teiglin]]. It was along this path which Turin stumbled across some of Haleths people, who dwelt  within the [[Forest of Brethil]].

Turin arrived to see a group of these woodmen surrounded and outnumbered by Orcs; they defended themselves desperately. In the mean time, Turin devised a cunning plan to fool and scare off the Orcs. Making a great deal of noise, Turin stumbled through the tree and shouted orders as if he were leading a group of armed men. When Turin jumped out before the Orcs, many instantly fled; the ones that were left soon scattered too, for they saw and knew fore-well the tale of [[Gurthang]], Turins blade.

Even the woodsmen believed Turin led a party of men, and upon discovering the truth they laughed and thanked Turin. [[Dorlas]], the leader of these men offered Turin a place amongst them; declining he told Dorlas of his quest to find Finduilas. Morosely, Dorlas told Turin of how they ambushed a slow moving group of Orcs who had many captives; he told him of how the Orcs killed there captives as soon as they were assailed. He also told Turin of how he knew Finduilas had been killed in particular, as he had spoken with her whilst she lay dying, against a tree with a spear thrust through her.

Turin demanded they take him to her burial mound. In grief he realized the courage of the [[House of Hador]]; he declared  that he should from now on be called "Turambar", and that he was to live with the woodmen in the forest of Brethil. He also stated that he should never-more take [[Gurthang]] into battle, instead wielding a bow and a spear.
