'''Larnach''' was one of the woodmen who dwelt in the [[Forest of Brethil]], south of the River [[Teiglin]]. These people were harried by the [[Gaurwaith]] outlaws from Doriath's western borders, and in a raid by these outlaws, Larnach's daughter was rescued by [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], under the alias of [[Neithan]].<ref>{{CH|6}}, 104</ref>
In his search for Túrin, [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] later came upon the fenced homestead that was Larnach's home, and was told the story.<ref>{{CH|6}}, 108</ref>
