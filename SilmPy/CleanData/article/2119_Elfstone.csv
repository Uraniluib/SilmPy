The '''Elessar''', translated as '''Elfstone''' in [[Westron]], also known as '''Stone of [[Eärendil]]''', was one, or possibly two, fabulous green gem(s) whose legends of creation are conflicting and complex. 

The Elessar was green as the leaves but had the light of the [[Sun]] trapped within it; it was marveled by the [[Noldor]], and those who looked through it were said to see the withered or aged as whole and young again. It was even claimed to grant some power of healing to its wearer.<ref name="CG"/>
==History==
The Elessar, or at least the first of them, was made in [[Gondolin]] during the [[First Age]]. Some name [[Enerdhil]] the jewelsmith as its maker, but others say it was his pupil, [[Celebrimbor]] son of [[Curufin]].<ref name="CG">{{UT|6}}</ref> 

This Elessar was saved from the [[Fall of Gondolin]] by [[Idril]], who gave it to her son [[Eärendil]], and with Eärendil it was carried across the Sea to the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]].<ref name="CG"/>

A legend says that Celebrimbor, who was in love with [[Galadriel]], remade another version of the lost jewel with less power than the original, in the [[Second Age]]. It was made as her behest, pained at the state of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="CG"/>

However another legend says that when the [[Wizards]] were sent from Valinor to Middle-earth in the [[Third Age]], [[Gandalf|Olórin]] brought back Earendil's jewel as a token from [[Yavanna]] that the [[Valar]] had not forsaken them; as [[Gandalf]], he gave it to Galadriel, and remarked prophetically that she would only hold it for a little while, before she passed it to another, who will also [[Aragorn|be called Elessar]].<ref name="CG"/>

===The Elessar of the Third Age===
Whatever the origins of Galadriel's Elfstone were, she gave it to her daughter [[Celebrían]], who in turn gave it to [[Arwen]]. <ref name="CG"/>

However by the time the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] visited the wood of [[Lothlórien]] it was again under Galadriel's possession. When the Fellowship departed and Galadriel offered them [[gifts of Galadriel|her gifts]], the Elessar was the gift for [[Aragorn]]<Ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>. This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|Laws}}</ref>

The Elfstone was worn by Aragorn ever after, and this causes him to also be given the name of '''King Elessar''' by the people of [[Minas Tirith]]. He adopted it as his royal name, as [[Gandalf]] foretold.

==In lore==
[[Bilbo Baggins]], during his stay in [[Rivendell]], was urged by Aragorn to include a green jewel in his [[Song of Eärendil]], possibly anticipating the symbolic importance that the gem would have in his life. Bilbo Baggins, obeying Aragorn but seemingly unaware of the Elfstone's story, included an inaccurate reference to an emerald.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>
