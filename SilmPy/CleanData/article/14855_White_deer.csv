'''White deer''' were a type of [[Deer|deer]] found in the forest of [[Mirkwood]]. Along with two fawns, such a hind surprised [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the [[Dwarves]] on the [[Quest of Erebor]] when they first entered [[Mirkwood]] forest.<ref>{{H|8}}</ref>

==Other writings==

An encounter with a white doe occurs in "[[The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun]]", preceding Autrou's meeting with a witch.

==Inspiration==

Magical animals of white colour were common in Celtic and Welsh mythology. The legends of King Arthur include a story about the pursuit of a large, white deer, leading to the arrival at the magical Sir Pellinore's well.<ref>Lars Noodén, "[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lars/rel375.html Animal Symbolism in Celtic Mythology]" (paper for Religion 375 at the University of Michigan, 22 November 1992; accessed 12 March 2011)</ref>

[[Douglas A. Anderson]] has noted that the appearance of white deer in ''The Hobbit'' forebodes the approach by Bilbo and company to the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elven]] area of Mirkwood, as "''[i]n Celtic tradition, encounters with white animals (especially white deer) usually prefigure an encounter with beings from the Otherworld ([[Fairies|Faërie]])''".<ref>{{HM|AH}}, pp. 200-1</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: The White Hart is the largest breed of deer found in northwestern Middle-earth (rumoured to have [[Fairies|Faerie]] blood). The suggested Sindarin name of this type of deer was ''Nimfiara'' in the early publications from MERP, later revised to ''Nimmerais'' (sing. ''Nimmaras'').<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2023}} (linguistic contributions by [[David Salo]] and [[Arden R. Smith]])</ref>

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
: The Extended Edition includes a scene in which a white deer appears as the dwarves try to cross the river in Mirkwood. [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]] tries to shoot it down with an arrow but he misses. The deer later flees.
