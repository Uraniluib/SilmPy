The '''Dark Years''' were the long years of the [[Second Age]] when the races of [[Middle-earth]], especially the [[Men]], suffered under the domination of [[Sauron]].
==Background==
After the [[War of Wrath]], [[Morgoth]] was defeated and judged by the [[Valar]], but his lieutenant [[Sauron]] escaped judgement. The [[Edain]] had been offered the isle of [[Elenna]] and flourished there. While the [[Elves]] and the [[Dwarves]] retreated in their respective realms, outside them, "Middle-earth went backward and light and wisdom faded".<ref name=Ak/> 

The [[Middle Men]] who did not heed the summons of the [[Valar]] and Morgoth fell back in a primitive state, having no contact with the [[Eldar]] or the [[Edain]]. Instead, some of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|evil Men]] who escaped the destruction of [[Beleriand]] came to the east and became their Kings. For this the Middle Men were neglected by the Valar.<ref name=Ak/>

It was thanks to the [[Entwives]] that some Mannish folk learned agriculture, and the Men honoured them.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> The primitive [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]] were defenceless against the remnants of Orcs, and were provided with metal weapons by the [[Longbeards]] who forged an [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men|Alliance]] with them.<ref name=pmrel/>

Around {{SA|600}} the [[Númenóreans]] sent ships to Middle-earth and established contact with the Middle Men and started teaching them agriculture, stonecraft and smithying. But it was around {{SA|882}} when King [[Gil-galad]] [[Gil-galad's letter|warned]] the Númenóreans that an evil power was taking shape in the [[East]].<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref><ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

Indeed, [[Sauron]] was ever at work gathering [[Men of Darkness]] in the east and the south<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> some of whom had been of old corrupted by [[Morgoth]].<ref name=pmrel/> He established himself to [[Mordor]] around {{SA|1000}} and fortified the land with the [[Black Gate]] and armies of Men whom he corrupted and enslaved. He also built [[Barad-dûr]] near [[Mount Doom]].

Sauron attempted to corrupt the prosperous [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]] persuading them to create the [[Rings of Power]]. When the Elves rejected him, they fought [[War of the Elves and Sauron|a bloody conflict against him]], but Sauron destroyed [[Eregion]] and devastated much of [[Eriador]], pushing the Elves back to the [[Blue Mountains]], as the [[Dwarves]] retreated to [[Moria]]. 
==The Dark Years begin==
Wearing a fair and wise guise for the Men who worshipped him as "Lord of the Earth", Sauron now dominated most of the [[East]] and the [[South]], even much of the [[Westlands]]. He gathered all evil things of his former master, multiplying the [[Orcs]]; he ruled with force and fear and it was then when he started to be known as the Dark Lord and the Enemy by those who saw his power spreading over the world. Allowing not any freedom or rivalry, he desired to destroy the [[Elves]] as well as Númenor. The Elves remembered those years as the "Days of Flight" as Sauron hunted them, and they fled to [[Lindon]], where Sauron could not enter, and thence over the [[Sea]] to the [[Uttermost West]].<ref name=rings/> 

Other peoples retreated to the mountains or the woods, in fear.<ref name=rings/> Reinforced and commanded by his servants, the Orcs invaded the mountains of the [[Longbeards]] again. [[Gundabad]] was re-taken, the [[Grey Mountains]] infested and [[Moria]] lost contact with the [[Iron Hills]]. This also broke their Alliance with the Northmen who also during those times had war against Orcs and savage tribes of [[Easterlings]]. The war scattered them and the diminished numbers who remained there were impoverished, living in caves or in the borders of [[Greenwood]].<ref name=pmrel>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>

Some of the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of the]] [[White Mountains]] feared Sauron and started worshipping him.<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> Others of their folk migrated northward to the southern dales of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=Men>{{App|Men}}</ref> 

But then the powerful Númenóreans responded to the Elves' plea and sent ships and armies to their support. The alliance, after heavy fighting, managed to reclaim Eriador and pushed the Dark Lord back to Mordor with a handful of orcs.<ref name=rings/>

The war ended, however this was not the end of the Dark Days. Sauron directed his power over the far south and east conquering and dominating the savage tribes.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>
===Shadow over Númenor===
Meanwhile Númenor fell under the [[Shadow]] and the colonists started to oppress the primitive Men of the Westlands, demanding tribute of goods and wealth.<ref name=Ak>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Some indigenous folk of Middle-earth were afraid of those [[Black Númenóreans]] and their ships who intended at some point to conquer the land of [[Agar]] and slay its people.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>

Sauron turned his attention to the west once more, declaring himself "King of Men", starting against the Númenórean colonists and their ports. The arrogant Númenóreans, who were traditionally the "Kings of Men", saw him as their competitor, and once more came against him. King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] took Sauron as a captive to [[Númenor]], further corrupting the Númenóreans, who continued to enslave the primitive Men and even using them as human sacrifices. The corruption eventually resulted to the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref name=Ak/>

Sauron's spirit escaped to Middle-earth, and returned to Mordor, where he slowly rebuilt his strength. Unable to assume a fair shape, he started to rule through terror and force.

==Fall of Sauron==

The [[Faithful]] who escaped founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in Middle-earth and gathered Mannish peoples under them, including the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]] who formerly worshipped Sauron. Sauron still considered the Númenóreans his most hated enemies and he launched a pre-emptive attack against them. The Númenóreans formed a [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with the [[Elves of Lindon]] and fought Sauron in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], where finally Sauron perished.<ref name=rings/>

Sauron's defeat ended the Dark Years and the Second Age, and allowed the Númenórean realms to flourish during the [[Third Age]].

==Names==
Other names of this period were the '''Black Years''', '''Days of Flight''' for the Elves who fled to the Sea,<ref name=rings/> and '''Dark Days'''<ref name=Foster>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 82</ref>.

At one point [[Aragorn]] mentions the '''Accursed Years''' to the [[Oathbreakers]], which [[Robert Foster]] identifies as another name of that period.<ref name=Foster/> On the other hand, the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] considers it a "''term of uncertain meaning''", probably referring to the [[Third Age]] when the Oathbreakers were cursed to roam the [[White Mountains]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/accursedyears.html|articlename=Accursed Years: The long years of Isildur's curse|dated=|website=EoA|accessed=19 May 2012}}</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Some of the Dark Years are seen during the [[Prologue: One Ring to Rule Them All...|Prologue]] to the film accompanied by [[Galadriel]]'s narration. After Sauron forged [[the One Ring]], his power is seen expanding over a map of the [[Westlands]], with flashback scenes of battles and peoples being ravaged and enslaved by [[Orcs]]. The Last Alliance is formed by the [[Free peoples]] as a direct response to Sauron's brutalities.
