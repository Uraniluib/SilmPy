'''Lothlórien''' is the sixth chapter of the second book in [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].

==Summary==
The company moved on and came to [[Durin's Stone]]. [[Gimli]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], looked into the dark waters of [[Mirrormere]], then proceeded to [[Lothlórien]], land of the Silvan [[Elves]]. Samwise and Frodo, who had been wounded from the battle in [[Moria]], were carried on the backs of [[Boromir]] and [[Aragorn]]. The company rested for a while and when Sam's wound was examined Aragorn realized that it would heal fast. But when he examined Frodo, he found [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] hidden [[mithril]] coat.

In the forest of Lothlórien, the travelers decided to rest. The Elves of the forest welcomed them, and for safety's sake, they blindfolded [[Gimli]], since Elves do not like [[Dwarves]]. The company climbed up into trees and spent the night there with [[Haldir]], [[Orophin]], and their brother [[Rúmil]]. Late at night, a company of [[Orcs]] passed by, as well as [[Gollum]], who was searching for the [[The One Ring|Ring]].

The next day Aragorn decided that since Gimli must be blindfolded, they should all proceed with blindfolds, against [[Legolas]]'s wishes. Later in the day, a message came from the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim|Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim]], welcoming them all, and ensuring that the Company needed no blindfolds. The forest was exquisite and the company admired it. The company saw the heart of [[Elvendom]] and felt the wonderful power of the [[Galadriel|Lady]] of the [[Galadhrim]].
