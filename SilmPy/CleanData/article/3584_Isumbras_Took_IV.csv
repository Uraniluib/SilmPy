'''Isumbras Took IV''' was the twenty-eighth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].
__NOTOC__
==History==
Isumbras was the third child, and second son, of [[Gerontius Took|Thain Gerontius]]<!--TCGTMe incorrectly says he was the "third son"-->. His father's office passed to his elder brother [[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]], but because of their father's longevity, Isengrim's reign did not last long. As he left no heir, Isumbras became [[Thain]] at the age of ninety-two, even older than his brother was. He served for nine years before he died, and the office passed to his son [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Isumbras" is of French and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and means "iron-arm". It comes from the French ''bras'' meaning "arm", and the Anglo-Saxon and Middle High German word ''[[isen]]'' which means "iron".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] likely got the name from ''[[wikipedia:Sir Isumbras|Sir Isumbras]]'', an English medieval romance about a man who suffers a lifetime of hardship but who finds happiness in his latter years.
