'''Ciryatur''' was the commander of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] fleet sent to aid [[Gil-galad]] in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]].  In {{SA|1700}}, Gil-galad’s [[Elves]] had been beaten back to the River [[Lhûn]] and Sauron had more forces approaching from the south-east when the great armament from [[Númenor]] arrived.  Sauron's host suffered heavy losses and was driven back.

Ciryatur had divided his forces, sending some directly to Gil-galad and some to the mouth of the [[Gwathló]] River.  This second force appeared in the rear of Sauron's army after they had been driven away from [[Sarn Ford]] with further losses.   In the ensuing [[Battle of the Gwathló]], the host of Sauron was completely routed and Sauron himself barely escaped.  A final battle in eastern [[Calenardhon]] stripped Sauron of all but a tiny bodyguard.  The Dark Lord retreated into [[Mordor]] and plotted vengeance upon the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ciryatur'' means "Ship Master" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[cirya]]'', 'ship', and ''[[-tur]]'', 'master')—an appropriate name for an admiral. It is in fact possible that this is the name of his position rather than himself (cf. [[Ohtar]]).
