The '''Woodmen''' were those [[Northmen]] who dwelt in the forests of [[Middle-earth]], and especially [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] in the [[Third Age|Third]] and [[Fourth Age]]s.

They were descended from the [[Men]] of the [[First Age]] who migrated to the [[Westlands|West]], therefore being related to the [[Edain]] and their descendants, the [[Dúnedain]]. In the [[Second Age]] many Men had settled in the northern and eastern borders of Greenwood.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

A band of Woodmen came and drove away some [[Orcs]] who killed [[Isildur]]'s band in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], before they could mutilate the bodies of the dead.<ref>{{UT|7}}</ref> 

In {{TA|1636}} the [[Great Plague]] affected Mirkwood<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> but it is not recorded how the woodmen fared.

The [[Eagles]] used to feed on men's [[sheep]] of the north, who defended them with their [[bows]] of yew; thus they were afraid to fly anywhere near where men lived.

Around {{TA|2941}} some bold woodmen and their families were attempting to make their way back to the north from the [[South (disambiguation)|South]], cutting down trees, and building settlements among the woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. The [[Wargs]] and the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] usually did not dare to approach as they were brave and well-armed, until they started planning a joint raid against them to capture slaves. When they discovered [[Thorin and Company]], they thought they were spies of those woodmen and hunted them down, fearing they would warn their people.<ref>{{H|6}}</ref>

Obvously the raid never took place, thanks to the subsequent events, including the [[Battle of Five Armies]] where Orcs and Wargs were devastated. After the Battle, Men could travel without fear and many came to [[Beorn]]'s home to celebrate [[Yule]], and some gathered under him as a chieftain.<ref>{{H|18}}</ref>

Despite troubled by evil creatures of [[Dol Guldur]] such as Orcs and [[Spiders]], they survived until the [[War of the Ring]] and the [[Fourth Age]]. 

After the cleansing of the forest, they and the [[Beornings]] were given the central portion of [[Eryn Lasgalen]], between the [[Narrows of the Forest]] and the [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Mountains]].<ref name=Guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Woodmen of the western Mirkwood"</ref>
