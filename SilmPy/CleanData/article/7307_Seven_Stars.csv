'''Seven Stars''' is a common symbol throughout [[Arda]].

It refers to the constellation that turns through the northern skies every night of the year. To the [[Elves]] this was the [[Valacirca]] that signalled the downfall of [[Morgoth]],<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> but the [[Men]] of the [[Northern lands]] called it simply '[[Valacirca|The Wain]]'.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> The Seven Stars are today known as the Plough, or the Big Dipper.

The [[Doors of Durin]] also displayed seven stars with a crown, probably representing [[Durin's Crown]].

Seven Stars was also the symbol of [[Elendil]], the leader of the [[Faithful]], and his heirs, representing the seven ships of the [[Faithful]] with a ''[[Palant√≠ri|palantir]]''.<ref>{{TT|III11}}</ref> The [[Crown of Gondor]] bore seven jewels of adamant set in the circlet.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>
