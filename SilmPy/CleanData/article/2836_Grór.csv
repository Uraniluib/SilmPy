'''Grór''' was a Dwarf and a significant leader among the people of Durin.

==Life==
===Birth and Early Life===
He was born into the [[House of Durin]] in {{TA|2563}} during its last troubled years in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He was the youngest of the three sons of King [[Dáin I]], who ruled [[Durin's folk]] during their [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons | war]] with the Dragons from the [[Northern Waste]]. When Grór was just twenty-six years old, a [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]] attacked [[Dáin's halls]], and killed his father and brother, [[Frór]].

The two remaining sons resolved to leave the Grey Mountains with their people and settle elsewhere. As the elder brother, [[Thrór]] inherited the Kingship, and led his people back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in the southeast. Young Grór however traveled east, to the [[Iron Hills]], where he founded a realm of his own becoming the first [[Lord of the Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin"/>

===Lord of the Iron Hills, and Later Life=== 
Grór saw many mishaps and tragedies during his rule. The kingdom of his brother Thrór was destroyed by the Dragon [[Smaug]], and Grór's son and heir, [[Náin son of Grór|Náin]], was killed at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|Battle of Nanduhirion]] before he could inherit. Grór's rule passed instead to his grandson.  

However under Grór's leadership the Iron Hills also became the strongest of the realms in the North both economically and militarily, having the capability of standing between [[Sauron]] and his plans to destroy [[Rivendell]] and taking back the lands of [[Angmar]].  Their numbers were also boosted by many of their fellow Longbeards fleeing from the [[Sack of Erebor]] and later those wandering in exile.

Grór ruled the [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] for two hundred and fifteen years, and was succeeded by his grandson [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]].  He died in {{TA|2805}} at 241 years of age.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Many years later, at the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Thrór's last descendant, [[Thorin]], was lost. Dáin II Ironfoot inherited the high Kingship of Durin's folk, a title that remained with the descendants of Grór.

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Grór'' (like ''[[Gróin#Etymology|Gróin]]'') is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''gróa'' ("to grow"), thus meaning "Growing-one".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>
