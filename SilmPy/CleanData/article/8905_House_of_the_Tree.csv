The '''House of the Tree''' was one of the noble [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim|Houses of the Gondolindrim]] of [[Gondolin]], under the leadership of [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]].  They wore green, and carried iron-studded [[clubs]] and [[slings]].  

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], they were one of the two main [[Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim|kindreds]] that first hurled themselves upon the [[Balrogs]] and [[Orcs]] upon the destruction of the Gate of Gondolin.  They guarded the western entrance to the [[Arch of Inwë]].  Many escaped the slaughter with [[Tuor]], and were scouts ahead of the women and children, for they had "eyes like cats in the dark", later dwelling at the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. They are often referred to as the ''People'' or ''Folk of Galdor''.<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
