'''Parmaitë''' was a nickname of '''[[Tar-Elendil]]''', the fourth [[King of Númenor]]. The name came from his hobby of making books from the notes on legends and lore gathered by his grandfather, [[Vardamir|Vardamir Nólimon]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}</ref>

His name means "Book-in-Hand" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[parma]]'' = "book" and ''-[[maitë]]'' = "handed").<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref>
