{{Pronounce|Eriador2.mp3|Ardamir}}'''Eriador''' was the large region in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]], defined between [[Lindon]] and the [[Blue Mountains]] to the west and [[Rhovanion]] and the [[Misty Mountains]] to the east.

It was inhabited by all the [[Free peoples]] of Middle-earth, being the location of many of the most important events of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages. By the end of the Third Age, its main inhabitants were [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] and [[Men]] of the surrounding lands.

==Boundaries==
===First Age===
[[Image:Steven White Jr. - North-west of Middle-earth (First Age).png|thumb|left|200px|[[User:Smeagol|Steven White Jr.]] - ''Middle-earth in the First Age'']]
It is known that the Blue Mountains existed during the First Age more formidable and longer than in the latter Ages;<ref name="Silm-map">{{S|Map}}</ref> whereas [[Morgoth|Melkor]] reared the [[Misty Mountains]] before the arrival of the [[Elves]] in order to hinder [[Oromë]]<ref name="Silm-Captive">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>. These ranges surrounded the eastern and western borders of Eriador.

The [[Iron Mountains]] (''Ered Engrin'') stretched across the north of the world in a curve from east to west, standing on the border of the [[Dor Daedeloth|region of everlasting cold]]<ref name="Silm-Bel">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and can be considered that they were northern border of Eriador.<ref>It is also seen in [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map V.png|this map drawn by Tolkien]]</ref>

It is unclear what the borders of Eriador were to the south; it is unknown whether the [[Greyflood]] or [[Lhûn|Lune]] rivers even existed in the First Age. Presumably the Greyflood followed the same route through Eriador to the lower end of the extended Blue Mountains - before reaching the sea somewhere to the west of the [[White Mountains]].<ref name="Atlas">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', revised edition, p. 4</ref>

===Second, Third and Fourth Ages===
{{blockquote|Eriador was of old the name of all the lands between the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[Blue Mountains|Blue]]; in the South it was bounded by the [[Greyflood]] and the [[Glanduin]] that flows into it above [[Tharbad]].|{{App|Eriador}}}}

In the [[Second Age|Second]], [[Third Age|Third]] and [[Fourth Age|Fourth]] ages, the boundaries of the region - listed clock-wise from due north - were as follows:
*to the north, the [[Icebay of Forochel]];
*to the north-east and east, the [[Misty Mountains]] (''Hithaeglir'');
*to the south-east, the river [[Glanduin]];
*to the south, the river [[Greyflood]] (''Gwathló'' or ''Gwathir'');
*to the south-west, the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] (''Belegaer'');
*and to the west and north-west, the [[Blue Mountains]] (''Ered Luin'' or ''Ered Lindon'').

==Geography==
:''See also: [[:Category:Eriador]] and [[:Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]''
Eriador was a large, inhabited temperate region in the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] which enjoyed warm summers and increasingly cool winters.<ref name="Prologue"/> At its widest extent, it stretched for around 675 miles from east-to-west, around 690 miles from north-to-south, 740 miles from northeast-to-southwest and 750 miles from northwest-to-southeast.<ref name="Distance">Estimates by [[User:Mith]] based on [[:File:Middle-earth map (1 of 4).png|the map from ''The Lord of the Rings'']]</ref>
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Old Man Willow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Drawing by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] showing the [[Withywindle]]]]
The most important rivers were: the [[Lhûn|Lune]] ([[Sindarin]] ''Lhûn'') which flowed through the Blue Mountains to form the [[Gulf of Lune]]; the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] (Sindarin ''Baranduin'') which flowed out of [[Lake Evendim|Lake Evendim]] (''Nenuial'') to form the eastern-boundary of [[the Shire]]; and the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]] (''Gwathló'') which formed the southern-border of Eriador. Other rivers include: the [[Glanduin]], which flowed out of [[Eregion|Hollin]] (''Eregion'') and into the Greyflood above [[Tharbad]], forming the [[Swanfleet]] (''Nîn-in-Eilph'') marsh; the [[Bruinen|Loudwater]] (''Bruinen''), passing [[Rivendell]] (''Imladris'') in the [[Ford of Bruinen]]; the [[Hoarwell]] (''Mitheithel'') which flowed out of the [[Ettenmoors]] and over which the [[Last Bridge]] passed; the [[Withywindle]] of the [[Old Forest]]; and [[The Water]], [[Stock-brook]], [[Shirebourn]] and [[Thistle Brook]] which all flowed into the Brandywine from in the Shire.<ref name="Shire-map">{{FR|Part}}</ref><ref name="ME-map">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[:File:Middle-earth map (1 of 4).png|Map 1]]</ref>

Central Eriador was scattered with many groups of hills including the [[Tower Hills]] (''Emyn Beraid''), [[Hills of Evendim]] (''Emyn Uial''), [[Weather Hills]] as well as the [[Far Downs]], [[White Downs]], [[South Downs]], [[North Downs]] and [[Barrow-downs]] (''Tyrn Gorthad''); [[Karen Wynn Fonstad|Fonstad]] noted that the "''longitudinal axes [of the hills] formed concentric rings''".<ref name="Atlas-Eriador">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', revised edition, p. 72</ref> Despite large deforestation by the [[Númenóreans]] during the [[Second Age]]<ref name="UT-Galadriel" /> some wooded areas remained, such as the [[Old Forest]], [[Woody End]], [[Bindbole Wood]] (sometimes seen as "Bindbale"), [[Chetwood]] around [[Bree-hill]], the [[Trollshaws]], and, largest of all, [[Eryn Vorn]];<ref name="ME-map"/> [[Eregion|Hollin]] was so named due to the large numbers of holly trees which grew there.<ref name="FR-Journey">{{FR|Journey}}</ref> Other geographic features include [[Midgewater Marshes]], [[Rushock Bog]], and [[Overbourn Marshes]].<ref name="Shire-map"/>

The [[East Road|East-West Road]] crossed Eriador from Rivendell in the east to the Grey Havens in the west whilst the [[Greenway]] ran south from [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]], linking [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]];<ref name="FR-Sign">{{FR|Sign}}</ref> the Greenway and the East-West Road met at [[Bree]]. Key [[Elves|Elvish]] settlements included the [[Grey Havens]], [[Ost-in-Edhil]]<ref name="S-Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> and [[Rivendell]]; for the [[Dúnedain]] there were [[Weathertop]], [[Annúminas]], and [[Fornost Erain]] as well as the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ports of [[Tharbad]] and [[Lond Daer]] (earlier known as [[Vinyalondë]]).

==History==
===Earlier History===
:''See also: [[Great Journey|Great March]]''

Before the [[First Age]], the [[Three Kindreds]] of the [[Elves]] passed through Eriador on their way to [[Beleriand]], to make the trip to [[Valinor]]. First came the [[Vanyar]], following closely by the [[Noldor]], but the third kindred, the [[Teleri]], tarried and were only urged forward at the behest of their lord, [[Elwë Singollo|Elwë]], who was keen to return to [[Valinor]].<ref name="Silm-Captive" />

Not all of the Teleri continued on the march as when the host reached the great river [[Anduin]] [[Lenwë]] led some of his people southwards away from the rest of his kin: these people became the [[Nandor]].<ref name="Silm-Captive" /> Some of these people eventually passed into Eriador, and dwelt there for a time, before [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]], son of Lenwë, gathered as many of the Nandor as possible and removed to [[Ossiriand]] to become the [[Nandor#Lenwë and Denethor|Laiquendi]].<ref name="Silm-Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

Another group that awoke and appeared during this time were the [[Firebeard]] and [[Broadbeam]] Dwarves. After they had awakened beneath Mount Dolmed, they eventually crossed over into Beleriand in {{YT|1250|n}} and encountered the Sindar for the first time.
They also built the two great Dwarf cities of Nogrod and Belegost in the Ered Luin, which were the chief suppliers of weaponry to the Elves of Beleriand, and as well as home to the world's greatest crafters.

===First Age===
In {{FA|310}} the first [[Men]] of the [[House of Bëor]] entered [[Beleriand]] from Eriador,<ref name="WOTJ">{{WJ|West}}, pp. 215 and 226</ref> and were discovered by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. These Men quickly made friendship with the [[Eldar]] and entered into their service, but [[Bereg]], great-grandson of [[Bëor]], was discontent and led those of like mind with himself back over the [[Blue Mountains|mountains]] into Eriador.<ref name="Silm-Men">{{S|West}}</ref>

Living in Eriador during the [[First Age]] were also men known as [[Easterlings#Easterlings of the First Age|Easterlings]], or ''Swarthy Men'', who they were led by [[Bór]] and [[Ulfang the Black|Ulfang]]. In {{FA|463}} Bór and Ulfang led many Men into Beleriand, as Men were often drawn westwards, and they met with the Eldar.<ref name="Silm-Fingolfin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Bór was faithful to the Eldar and his people followed [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], but [[Ulfang the Black|Ulfang]] [[Treachery of Men|betrayed]] the Eldar and [[Edain]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] - even though he swore an oath of allegiance with [[Caranthir]] - successfully fulfilling the designs of [[Morgoth]] in the process.<ref name="Silm-Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

===Second Age===
=====Elves and Númenóreans=====
:''See also: [[Númenóreans#Dominion over the Men of Middle-earth]]''
Following the [[War of Wrath]] - and the destruction of [[Beleriand]] - many [[Elves]] left for [[Aman]] whilst the remnants of the [[Edain]] removed to live on the newly-formed isle of [[Númenor]]. The remaining Elves moved to [[Middle-earth]], and in the year {{SA|750|n}} of the [[Second Age]] the remnants of the [[Noldor]] established the realm of [[Eregion]] in the south-east of Eriador.<ref name="App-B1">{{App|B1}}</ref>

In {{SA|600}} the first [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ships began to visit [[Middle-earth]] and when news of this reached the [[Men]] of Eriador they were amazed and scared. On the [[Tower Hills]] the Númenóreans met with just twelve [[Men]] from Eriador and both sides recognised their ancient kinship: the Númenóreans discovered that these people lived in the hills east of the [[Baranduin]] and were likely the descendants of the people of [[Bëor]] and [[Hador]] who never crossed the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref name="UT-Wife" />
[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Ost-in-Edhil cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Felix Sotomayor]] - ''[[Ost-in-Edhil]]'']]
In {{SA|725}} [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] first visits [[Lindon]] and Eriador and begins a long-lasting friendship with [[Gil-galad]]. He made many voyages to Middle-earth and established the haven of [[Vinyalondë]] (later known as [[Lond Daer]]) on the banks of the river [[Gwathir]] - a move which proved crucial in defeating Sauron later in the Second Age.<ref name="UT-Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref> As a mariner, Aldarion had a great desire to build ships and in order to this he began deforesting much of the [[Minhiriath]] and [[Enedwaith]]; this angered the native forest-dwelling Men who subsequently fled to the forest of [[Eryn Vorn]].<ref name="UT-Galadriel" />

=====War with Sauron=====
:''See also: [[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''

The Noldor of Eregion grew in unparalleled friendship with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], to the benefit of both peoples, and there was much traffic between the Elven city of [[Ost-in-Edhil]] and the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] of Moria. In Eregion the Elven craftsmen became great in knowledge as they were led by [[Celebrimbor]], grandson of [[Fëanor]], the most skilled of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] ("the People of the Jewel-smiths").<ref name="Silm-Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> 

[[Sauron]] saw that the [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]] were vulnerable and he came to them in the guise of [[Annatar]], "Lord of Gifts", and they welcomed him and he taught them many things of lore and smith-craft. In {{SA|1500}}, when the knowledge and skill of the Elves reached its height, they began the [[Rings of Power#The Creation of the Rings of Power|forging]] of the [[Rings of Power]], but, in {{SA|1600}}, Sauron secretly created [[the One Ring]] to rule over all the other Rings.<ref name="Silm-Rings" />

When Sauron put on the Ring the Elves realised they had been fooled so they hid all the other Rings from him; Sauron, however, demanded that all the Rings be given to him as they were created with his help. When the Elves refused Sauron was vengeful and in {{SA|1693}} began the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] with an invasion of Eriador in {{SA|1695|n}}.<ref name="Silm-Rings" /> [[Elrond]] was sent by [[Gil-galad]] with a force to aid Celebrimbor, but not only they were unable to stop Sauron, but they would also be destroyed if it weren't for an attack upon Sauron's force from the rear by [[Dwarves]] from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. With some survivors from Eregion, Elrond retreated northwards.<ref name="Galadriel">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Death of Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|''Death of Celebrimbor'' by Abe Papakhian]]
In {{SA|1697|n}}, with Celebrimbor's death and Eregion lain waste, [[Elrond]] founded the refuge of [[Rivendell|Imladris]] as a defence against Sauron, and was joined by Men and Elves, swelling his forces; Sauron had taken over all of Eriador by {{SA|1699}}, once he drove the Dwarves back into Khazad-dûm and the gates were shut. While Sauron sent most of his army west to attack [[Lindon]] he had to leave a strong detachment behind to contain Elrond<ref name="Galadriel"/>and [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged Imladris]].<ref name="App-B1" />

[[Gil-galad]] sent word to [[King of Númenor|King]] [[Tar-Minastir]] of [[Númenor]] calling for aid, but when the ships finally arrived in {{SA|1700}} (landing in Lindon and [[Vinyalondë]]) Sauron was already preparing his invasion of [[Lindon]]. The forces of [[Gil-galad]], [[Elrond]] and [[Ciryatur]] caused heavy losses at [[Sarn Ford]] before Sauron's forces were utterly destroyed at the [[Battle of the Gwathló]], with Sauron barely escaping with his life. However, Eriador lay in ruins as many of the native [[Men]], Elves and Númenóreans had been killed by Sauron and his forces had ravaged the lands and destroyed many of the remaining forests.<ref name="UT-Galadriel">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

The Elven lords decided in a Council that Imladris should become the new Elvish stronghold in eastern Eriador after the destruction of Eregion; Gil-galad also bestowed the ring [[Vilya]] upon Elrond and made him his vice-regent.<ref name="Galadriel"/>

=====Last Alliance=====
:''See also: [[War of the Last Alliance]]''
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Last Alliance.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[War of the Last Alliance]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]
Throughout the [[Second Age]] the [[Númenóreans]] gradually increased their power in [[Middle-earth]] by creating coastal dominions; they eventually have the strength to confront [[Sauron]] and take him prisoner to [[Númenor]]. Whilst there, Sauron seduced the [[King of Númenor|King]] - and most of the people - and persuades [[Ar-Pharazôn]] to break the [[Ban of the Valar]] causing [[Ilúvatar]] to change the shape of the [[Arda|World]], destroying Númenor in the process.<ref name="Silm-Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> [[Faithful|The Faithful]] - those Númenóreans who remained true to the [[Valar]] and friendly with the [[Elves]] - were spared and in {{SA|3320}} [[Elendil]] establishes the two [[Realms in Exile]]: [[Gondor]] in the south and [[Arnor]] in Eriador.<ref name="App-B1" />

Sauron - who is now unable to take fair form<ref name="App-Numenor">{{App|Numenor}}</ref> - returned to [[Mordor]] and in {{SA|3429}} attacked [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]] and burning [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]].<ref name="App-B1" /> [[Isildur]] - son of Elendil - fled north to join his father in Arnor who took counsel with [[Gil-galad]], for both foresaw the need to triumph over Sauron before his power grew unstoppable: in {{SA|3430}} they formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. In {{SA|3431}} Elendil and Gil-galad marched east to [[Rivendell|Imladris]]; the host was the fairest and most splendid in arms ever seen in Middle-earth and the greatest ever assembled since the [[Host of the Valar]].<ref name="Silm-Rings" />

===Third Age===
=====Arnor and Division=====
[[File:John Howe - The One Ring 04.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[John Howe]] - ''[[The One Ring]]'']]
:''See also: [[Arnor]]''

Following [[Sauron]]'s defeat during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], [[Isildur]] took [[the One Ring]] for himself as a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weregild weregild] for his father, but, during the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] the Ring betrayed him to his death; the Ring was lost and not found again for 2,500 years.<ref name="FR-Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref> The [[Kings of Arnor|kingship]] of Arnor passed to Isildur's only surviving son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] whose reign begins an uneventful 800 years in the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]].<ref name="App-B2">{{App|B2}}</ref> 

The unity of Arnor was broken, however, when, in [[Third Age]] [[Third Age 861|861]], following the death of the tenth [[Kings of Arnor|king]], [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], the dissension amongst his three sons led to the division of Arnor into three kingdoms: [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. There was often strife between the kingdoms, especially over ownership of the Weather Hills and the chief ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]'' of the North at [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], and this quickened the waning of the [[Dúnedain]].<ref name="App-Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Arthedain was in the North-west and included the land between [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] and [[Lhûn|Lune]], and also the land north of the [[East Road|Great Road]] as far as the [[Weather Hills]]. Rhudaur was in the North-east and lay between the [[Ettenmoors]], the Weather Hills, and the [[Misty Mountains]], but included also the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]] between the [[Hoarwell]] and the [[Loudwater]]. Cardolan was in the South, its bounds being the Brandywine, the [[Greyflood]], and the Great Road.|{{App|Eriador}}}}

The line of Isildur was maintained with the [[Kings of Arthedain]] all the way through to [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], but the line of kings in Cardolan and Rhudaur quickly dwindled. By {{TA|1349|n}}, with the rule of [[Argeleb I]], the Kings of Arthedain were once again claiming lordship over all of Arnor and prefixed their names with ''[[Ar|ar-]]'' in recognition of this.<ref name="App-North">{{App|North}}, note 4</ref>

=====Rise of Angmar=====
[[File:Rob Alexander - The Witch King of Angmar.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The [[Witch-king|Witch King]] of [[Angmar]] by [[Rob Alexander]]]]
In the year {{TA|1300}}<ref name="App-B2" /> evil things begin to return to the world with the [[Witch-king]] founding the evil realm of [[Angmar]] beyond the [[Ettenmoors]] in the far north-east of Eriador, hoping to utterly destroy the [[Dúnedain]] of the North, seeing hope in the fragmentation of [[Arnor]].<ref name="App-Eriador" /> 

In league with [[Lindon]] and [[Cardolan]], [[Kings of Arthedain|King]] [[Arveleg I]] of [[Arthedain]] successfully fortified the [[Weather Hills]] against [[Angmar]] whilst [[Rivendell]] was being besieged. However, in {{TA|1409}} a great force came out of Angmar, surrounding [[Weathertop]], defeating the [[Dúnedain]], slaying Arveleg and the last prince of Cardolan whilst destroying the tower of Amon Sûl. The ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' was saved in retreat to [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]] but Cardolan was ravaged and [[Rhudaur]] became a vassal-state of Angmar; in response, [[Elrond]] brought [[Elves]] from [[Lothlórien]] and [[Círdan]] sent aid from [[Lindon]] to repel Angmar from the [[North Downs]] and Fornost - for a time, Angmar was subdued.<ref name="App-Eriador" />

During the [[Angmar War]], the weather and climate in Eriador became unfriendly, and all these circumstances forced the [[Stoors]] to leave the [[Angle of Eriador]]. In {{TA|1636}} the [[Great Plague]] came up from the south-east with many in Cardolan (especially in [[Minhiriath]]) and [[the Shire]] perishing; as Cardolan was deserted, the [[Witch-king]] sent evil spirits to dwell in the revered [[Barrow-downs]].<ref name="App-Eriador" /> The Plague marked the beginning of the desolation of [[Eriador]], that continued being depopulated from [[Men]] for the rest of the [[Age]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref>

=====Destruction of Arnor=====
:''See also: [[Arnor#The_Fall of Arthedain]] and [[Arvedui#Life as King]]''

After many years of silence, King [[Araphant]] of [[Arthedain]] and King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] renewed communications between the two realms as they perceived that there was a single power directing the enemies or both [[Arnor]] and Gondor,<ref name="App-Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> as such in {{TA|1940}} Araphant's son [[Arvedui]] married Ondoher's daughter [[Fíriel]].<ref name="App-B2" /> Despite the marriage, neither kingdom was able to send aid to the other as Angmar continued to attack Athedain while the [[Wainriders]] attacked Gondor; in the [[Battle of the Camp]] of {{TA|1944}} Ondoher was killed.

{{blockquote|On the death of Ondoher and his sons, Arvedui of the North-kingdom claimed the crown of Gondor, as the direct descendent of [[Isildur]], and as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of Ondoher. The claim was rejected. In this [[Pelendur]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] of King Ondoher, played the chief part.<br/><br/>The [[Council of Gondor]] answer: "''The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely with the heirs of [[Meneldil]], son of [[Anárion]], to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In Gondor this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not heard that the law is otherwise in Arnor.''"|{{App|Gondor}}}}

Instead, a distant relative, [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], was chosen as [[Kings of Gondor|King]]. Arvedui did not press his claim, but nor did the [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnedain of the North]] forget it, for their kingdom diminished as foretold by [[Malbeth]] the [[Seers|Seer]]: in {{TA|1974}} Angmar returned with renewed vigour, attacking the Dúnedain, capturing [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]] and destroying Arnor. After holding out for a while on the [[North Downs]], Arvedui was forced to flee to the [[Blue Mountains|mountains]] where he stayed in some old [[Dwarves|dwarf]] mines; out of hunger, he and his men travelled north and spent the winter with the [[Lossoth]] on the [[Icebay of Forochel]]. Arvedui perished and two ''[[palantíri]]'' were lost.<ref name="App-Eriador" />

[[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] had told Arvedui, "''I do not forget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the realms of [[Elendil]] be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have need, so long as I am able.''"<ref name="App-Gondor" /> In {{TA|1973}} he received a request for aid and sent his son, [[Eärnur]], north with a great host: they arrived at the [[Grey Havens]] too late. However, in {{TA|1975}} [[Círdan]] and Eärnur amassed a great army and met the forces of Angmar on the plain by [[Lake Evendim|Lake Nenuial]] in the [[Battle of Fornost]]: the force was too strong for the [[Witch-king]] and his army fled but his retreat was cut off by Gondor's cavalry and a host of [[Elves]] led by [[Glorfindel]] who had come north from [[Rivendell]].<ref name="App-B2" /> 

Despite the utter destruction of Angmar, [[Arthedain]] was also over. Arvedui's son, [[Aranarth]], took the title "[[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]" and the heirlooms of [[Arnor]] were given into the keeping of [[Elrond]].<ref name="App-B2" /> The Dúnedain continued as a secretive and wandering people, fighting with the sons of Elrond to protect their former lands: they mostly lived out their full lives (save for [[Aragorn I]] who was slain by [[wolves]]) until the days of [[Arassuil]] when evil things began to multiply again.<ref name="App-Eriador" />

=====Foundation of the Shire=====

:''See also: [[The Shire#History]]''

[[Hobbits]] (or ''[[Perian|Periannath]]'' in [[Sindarin]]) first entered Eriador in {{TA|1050}} when [[Harfoots]] came over the [[Misty Mountains]] from the [[Vales of Anduin]] in order to move away from [[Necromancer|the shadow]] which had fallen over [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. In around {{TA|1150}} they were joined by the [[Fallohides]] whilst the [[Stoors]] came over the [[Caradhras#The Redhorn Gate|Redhorn Pass]] and moved to [[Dunland]] and the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]]. With the rise of [[Angmar]] some Hobbits migrate westward and settle in [[Bree]]; in {{TA|1356}} the Stoors leave the Angle, some of whom returned to  [[Rhovanion]]<ref name="App-B2" /> to become a people of fisher-folk.<ref name="App-Eriador" />

In {{TA|1601}}, led by [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]], Hobbits obtained permission from [[Kings of Arthedain|King]] [[Argeleb II]] to settle in the region beyond the [[Baranduin|Brandywine River]] on the proviso that they maintain the [[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Stonebows]] and other bridges and roads, whilst acknowledging Argeleb's lordship. With the foundation of [[the Shire]], the year [[Third Age]] 1601 became the year 1 in [[Shire Calendar|Shire-reckoning]].<ref name="Prologue">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> On the war with with Angmar the following is recorded:

{{blockquote|The [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]] survived, though [[Angmar War|war]] swept over them and most fled into hiding. To the help of [[Arvedui|the king]] they sent some archers who never returned; and others went also to the [[Battle of Fornost|battle in which Angmar was overthrown]] [...] Afterwards in the peace that followed the [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]] ruled themselves and prospered. They chose a [[Thain]] to take the place of the King [...] The first Shire-thain was one [[Bucca of the Marish|Bucca]] of the [[Marish]], from whom the [[Oldbuck Family|Oldbucks]] claimed descent. He became Thain in {{SR|379|n}}|{{App|Eriador}}}}

For the next thousand years Hobbits were little-affected by the dangers of the world around them as they grew large in both number and wealth.<ref name="Prologue"/> Despite the end of the [[Watchful Peace]] in {{TA|2460}} - with the passes across the [[Misty Mountains]] being barred by [[Sauron]]'s creatures - Eriador not was attacked by [[orcs]] until {{TA|2740|n}}.<ref name="App-B2" /> Seven years later [[Bandobras Took]] led a group of hobbits in successfully defending the Shire against marauding orcs from [[Mount Gram]] led by [[Golfimbul]] in the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref> Hobbits faced further hardship in {{TA|2758}} in the shape of the [[Long Winter]] which killed thousands of hobbits and resulted in a [[Days of Dearth|dreadful famine]]; in {{TA|2911}} the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] began, freezing the rivers and bringing [[White Wolves|white wolves]] from the north (in the floods which followed the city of [[Tharbad]] was destroyed).<ref name="App-B2" />

=====War of the Ring=====
:''See also:'' ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[War of the Ring]]''

On [[14 March|March 14]], {{TA|2941}},<ref name="App-Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> a chance encounter between the [[wizards|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] and [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Thorin II Oakenshield|Thorin Oakenshield]] in [[Bree]] set in motion a series of events which led to the downfall of [[Sauron]] and the establishment of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Thorin was seeking to regain his [[Thráin|father]]'s [[Lonely Mountain|kingdom]] and [[Arkenstone|wealth]] was seeking assistance; Gandalf - worried about the threat of the [[dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] - agreed to assist, and forcibly enlisted the help of [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref name="UT-Erebor">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> As the [[Thorin and Company|Company]] of fifteen (thirteen [[dwarves]] with Gandalf and Bilbo) travelled towards [[Rivendell]] they [[Roast Mutton|encountered three trolls]] - thanks to Gandalf they avoided death whilst managing to gain the two [[Elves|Elvish]] swords [[Glamdring]] and [[Orcrist]], and the dagger [[Sting]]. Out of this quest Bilbo obtained [[Gollum]]'s [[The One Ring|magic ring]].<ref name="H-Riddles">{{H|Riddles}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Storming the Bank.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Storming the Bank'']]
Following [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's disappearance]] in {{TA|3001}}, Bilbo's "nephew", [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], inherited all of Bilbo's possessions, including Bilbo's ring.<ref name="FR-Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref> Bilbo travelled through Eriador, eventually staying with [[Elrond]] in Rivendell, whilst Frodo continued to live in [[Bag End]]. However, by {{TA|3018}}, Frodo, with [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], is forced to set out from [[the Shire]] to head towards Bree in order to deliver what is now known to be [[the One Ring]]; on the way, the [[Hobbits]] encounter the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and [[Barrow-wights]], as well as [[Farmer Maggot]], [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] and [[Tom Bombadil]]. In [[Bree]], the [[Travellers]] met a man called "[[Aragorn|Strider]]", who had been sent to safely escort the hobbits to Rivendell;<ref name="FR-Strider">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> despite being attacked by Black Riders on [[Weathertop]] and again confronted by them at the [[Ford of Bruinen]], they all eventually make it safely to Rivendell. At Rivendell, a [[Council of Elrond|Council]] decides that [[Fellowship of the Ring|a group of nine people]] should go on a quest to destroy the Ring.<ref name="FR-Council" />

After destroying the [[the One Ring]], witnessing the downfall of [[Sauron]] and the coronation of "Strider" as [[Kings of Gondor|King]] Elessar of [[Gondor]], the four hobbits and Gandalf returned to Eriador.<ref name="RK-Homeward">{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> Gandalf left the hobbits at the [[Old Forest]] - deciding to visit [[Tom Bombadil]] - but when they arrived at the [[Brandywine Bridge]] they saw that [[the Shire]] had been badly affected by [[Saruman]] via his puppet "[[Chief Shirriff|Chief]]" and the use of [[ruffians]]. After breaking many of the new "rules", the four hobbits were escorted to [[Hobbiton]] by a troop of [[Shirriffs]] (including [[Robin Smallburrow]]) where the four hobbits began a rebellion in the form of the successful [[Battle of Bywater]]: the ruffians were killed (as was [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]) or captured and the [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]] were liberated (at the cost of [[The Roll|19 lives]]).<ref name="RK-Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

Following the [[Battle of Bywater]] and the end of the [[War of the Ring]], Frodo temporarily took the position of Deputy [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]] whilst Sam used [[Sam's garden box|his gift]] from [[Galadriel]] to replenish the Shire of its lost flora (bringing a [[Mallorn]] tree to the [[Party Field]]).<ref name="RK-Havens">{{RK|Havens}}</ref> On [[21 September|September 21]], {{TA|3021}}, Frodo and Sam set out from [[the Shire]] to meet the [[Last Riding of the Keepers|Last Riding]] of the [[Three Keepers]]: on [[29 September|September 29]] they reached the [[Grey Havens]] where Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, Galadriel and [[Elrond]] departed [[Middle-earth]]; the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] was left with Sam.<ref name="App-B4">{{App|Chief}}</ref>

===Fourth Age===
In the year {{SR|1422|n}} of [[Shire Calendar|Shire-reckoning]] the [[Fourth Age]] began following the departure of the [[Ring-bearers]], the defeat of [[Sauron]] and re-establishment of [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south. In {{FoA|6}} [[Kings of Arnor|King]] [[Aragorn|Elessar]] of [[Arnor]] makes [[the Shire]] a [[Free Land]] under the protection of the [[Sceptre of Annúminas|Northern Sceptre]] and declares that no [[Men|man]] should ever enter the Shire.<ref name="App-B5">{{App|Later}}</ref> In {{FoA|15}} Elessar stays at [[Lake Evendim]], meeting his friends at [[Brandywine Bridge]]; in {{FoA|31}} he gives the [[Westmarch]] - the area between the [[Far Downs]] and [[Tower Hills]] - to the Shire as well as officially adding [[Buckland]] to the Shire.<ref name="Prologue"/> In {{FoA|61}} [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] eventually passed over [[Belegaer|the sea]] and in {{FoA|63}} [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] leave the Shire and travel south to [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]].<ref name="App-B5"/>

It is unknown how many, if any, [[Elves]] were left in Eriador during the Fourth Age; presumably very few [[Noldor]], at least.<ref name="RK-Havens"/>

==Etymology==
{{Transcribed|Tengwar Eriador.png|Eriador|Tengwar, Sindarin mode}}
There are at least two, slightly different, versions of the etymology of ''Eriador'':
#''Eriador'' as [[Sindarin]] (derived from [[Noldorin]]), whose derivation is quoted by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] from an unnamed note dated 1949-53. This explains that ''Eriador'' is derived from ''eryā'', "isolated, lonely" and ''[[Dôr|dor]]'', "land", thereby translating ''Eriador'' as "wilderness".<ref name="VT42">"Letters to VT" in [[Carl F. Hostetter]] (ed.), ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'', [[Vinyar Tengwar 42|vol. 42]], July [[2001]], p. 4</ref>
#In another manuscript, Tolkien stated that ''Eriador'' was a [[Silvan Elvish]] name, meaning "Lonely land" (deriving from *''eryā'', S ''eir'', ''air'').<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}, p. 28</ref>

Both translations are noticeably similar to the "[[Lone-lands]]" mentioned in ''[[The Hobbit]]'';<ref name="Hob-Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> it is unknown whether they are the same or simply coincidental.

==In Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In earlier sketches of the [[maps]] of [[Middle-earth]] Eriador is originally called "Forodwaith" - the name which is now applied to the [[Forodwaith (lands)|very cold region]] to the north of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="Treason">{{TI|MII}}, pp. 305-306</ref>
