{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Capan,<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the pleasure and honour of your invitation to visit the Cambridge University English Club. I am afraid, however, that I must decline with regret. It's difficult for me to get to Cambridge in term-time, especially in the middle of the week, and I simply have not the time for the composition of any paper or address worthy of your notice and hospitality.<br/><br/>Yours Sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien.}}
