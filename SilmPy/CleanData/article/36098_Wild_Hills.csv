The '''Wild Hills''' were part of the Wide World outside of the village of [[Ham]], the home of [[Farmer Giles]].  They lay to the west and north of Ham, near the dubious marches of the mountain-country.  [[The Giant]] who came blundering into Farmer Giles’ fields usually went walking in the Wild Hills (it was only by making a bad guess when he was lost that the Giant came to lands inhabited by men). <ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>
