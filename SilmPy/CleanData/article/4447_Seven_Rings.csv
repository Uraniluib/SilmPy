The '''Seven Dwarf-rings''' were the [[Rings of Power]] given to seven [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] Lords by [[Sauron]] in the guise of [[Annatar]]. Apparently the Lords were the Kings of the Seven Houses, as [[Gandalf]] mentions that the Rings were given to the "Dwarf-kings".<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

The most famous was the [[Ring of Thrór]]: in Dwarven tradition it was said [[Celebrimbor]] gave the Ring to [[Durin III]] king of [[Durin's Folk]] before the Downfall of [[Eregion]],<ref name="a">{{HM|AA}}</ref> but this seems unlikely as Celebrimbor was said to have yielded the Seven - all the Seven - to Sauron after torture.<ref name=ring>{{S|Rings}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

The Dwarf Lords proved resistant to the malevolent magic of the rings, which could not even turn them invisible, as they are hard to tame, and thoughts of their hearts are hidden.<ref name=ring/> The rings, used only for the gaining of wealth, amplified their wearer's natural skills and desire of dominion which as a consequence, made them greedy and exceedingly rich; the Rings gave them the power to multiply whatever they mined.<ref name="a">{{HM|AA}}</ref> It is said that thanks to them the [[Seven Hoards]] were made. But also the Rings kindled greed and wrath in the Dwarves, bringing evils that in the long-term benefitted Sauron.<ref name=ring/>

Four were swallowed or destroyed by [[Dragons]], but Sauron succeeded in finding two. The last one was worn by [[Thráin|Thráin II]], but in {{TA|2845}} he was imprisoned by Sauron in the dungeons of [[Dol Guldur]], and the ring was taken from him.<ref name="a"/>

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' 
:The Seven appear in the introduction of the movie, worn by Dwarf kings. They are designed consistently to the general 'Dwarven' aesthetics of the movie, with angular, crystalline shapes. However nowhere in Tolkien's books is mentioned that the Seven were designed or made for the Dwarves.<ref>FAQ of the Rings: [http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q79-Differ How did the Seven and the Nine differ?] and [http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q79-Intent Were the Seven and Nine Rings originally intended for Dwarves and Men?]</ref>

'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Dwarf-rings consumed by dragons were not destroyed, but Sauron had those dragons imprisoned and tortured in an attempt to recover the Rings. The "Ring-drakes", as they were called, were "Hrímil Frost-heart", who consumed "Tínya" and the king of the Eastern "Zhélruka" dwarves who bore it; "Thostír the Rank", who consumed "Tulcya", the ring of another House in [[Rhûn]]; and "Fingar the Greedy", a Great Worm of [[Angband]] who consumed "Úrya" and "Vanya", the Rings of the Ered Luin kingdoms.

:Two other rings of the eastern Houses were reclaimed by Sauron: "Taurya" and "Sindya", the Ring of the "Firehorns" (later dubbed "Stout-axes"), who called it "Manthríf". "Angya" was the name of the Ring of Durin, which was called "Handórm" by the Dwarves.
