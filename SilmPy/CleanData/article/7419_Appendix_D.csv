'''Appendix D''' is the fourth Appendix to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and is entitled ''Calendars''.  In it, Tolkien outlines the various calendar systems used in [[Middle-earth]].  These include the [[Shire Calendar]], the Calendar of Imladris (or [[Reckoning of Rivendell]]), and the [[Gondorian]] systems of the [[Kings' Reckoning]] (inherited from the [[Númenóreans]]), the [[Stewards' Reckoning]], and the [[New Reckoning]].

Special prominence is given to the Shire Calendar, for which a complete table of the days and months of the year is provided.  

This Appendix also gives the names of the seasons, months, and days of the week for the Rivendell and Gondor calendars in [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], and the names of the months and days of the week according to the Shire Calendar.
