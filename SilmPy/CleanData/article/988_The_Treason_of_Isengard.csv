'''''The Treason of Isengard''''' is the second volume of the ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'' and the seventh volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The Treason of Isengard continues the account of the creation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' started in the earlier volume, ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''. It traces the great expansion of the tale into new lands and new peoples south and east of the Misty Mountains: the emergence of [[Lothlórien]], of [[Ents]], of the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]], and of [[Saruman]] the White in the fortress of [[Isengard]]. In brief outlines and penciled drafts dashed down on scraps of paper are seen the first entry of [[Galadriel]], the earliest ideas of the history of [[Gondor]], and the original meeting of [[Aragorn]] and [[Éowyn]], its significance destined to be wholly transformed.The book also contains a full account of the original map which was to be the basis of the emerging geography of [[Middle-earth]]; and an appendix examines the Runic alphabets, with illustrations of the forms and an analysis of the Runes used in the [[Book of Mazarbul]] found beside [[Balin]]'s tomb in [[Moria]].}}
