'''''The Jerusalem Bible''''' is a Roman Catholic translation of the Old Testament of the Bible. Its sources were the original Hebrew and Greek texts, with some contribution from later Greek and Latin translations.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was among its contributors, as translator and lexicographer. The extent of Tolkien's contribution to the translation of this book is uncertain, but he is thought to have worked on the book of Jonah, and possibly the book of Job as well.<ref>''An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography'' at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ Tolkienbooks] (accessed 6 December 2010)</ref>

In [[Letter 294 ]] to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer Tolkien stated:

''Naming me among the 'principal collaborators' was an undeserved courtesy on the part of the editor of theJerusalem Bible. I was consulted on one or two points of style, and criticized some contributions of others. I was originally assigned a large amount of text to translate, but after doing some necessary preliminary work I was obliged to resign owing to pressure of other work, and only completed 'Jonah', one of the shortest books''.
