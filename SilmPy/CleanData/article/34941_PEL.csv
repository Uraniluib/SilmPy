{{disambig-more|Pel|[[Pel (disambiguation)]]}}
'''PEL''', or '''PELE''', is a [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] signifying "edge, bound, fence, limit, border".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, pp. 65, 92, 171 (roots appearing as "√PEL", "PEL", "√PELE)"</ref>

In his Appendix to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] noted the Elvish element or root ''pel-'' (signifying "go round, encircle").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> It is unknown if he reconstructed this element from writings by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] which have appeared in print after [[1977]] (when the work was first published), or if he used manuscripts which still are unpublished.
