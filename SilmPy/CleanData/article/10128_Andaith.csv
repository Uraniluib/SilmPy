The '''Andaith''' or "long mark" was the long-vowel diacritical mark used in [[Tengwar]] of the [[Tengwar/Mode of Beleriand|Mode of Beleriand]].  In this mode of 'full writing', vowels were represented by separate letters rather than as [[tehtar]] so a different means was needed to indicate long vowels.  The andaith appeared as an 'acute accent'.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>
