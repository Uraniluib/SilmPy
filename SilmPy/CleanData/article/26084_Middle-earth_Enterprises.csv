'''Middle-earth Enterprises''', formerly ''Tolkien Enterprises'' (sometimes abbreviated to ''TE''), is the division of the Saul Zaentz Company, created by [[Saul Zaentz]] to manage his licenses for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''. 

==History==
In [[1969]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] sold certain rights to [[United Artists]], for US$250,000.<ref>John Ezard, "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/dec/14/lordoftherings.jrrtolkien So, would Tolkien have liked the film?]", ''The Guardian'' ([[14 December|December 14]], [[2001]])</ref> This was then resold to independent producer [[Saul Zaentz]] in [[1976]]. [[Ralph Bakshi]], who had tried to argue with United Artists over an animated feature film for years, found more success with Zaentz. With a budget of US$7 million, it became quite an endeavour.<ref>[[Barry Langford]], "Bakshi, Ralph", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pp. 48-50</ref>

After Bakshi's box office failure, and the non-success of the [[Rankin/Bass]] productions, Zaentz was reluctant to market another adaptation, but would grant license to [[Peter Jackson]] if he could find a production studio. After being turned down by [[Miramax]], [[New Line Cinema]] went ahead with [[The Lord of the Rings]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]]'', "[[From Book to Vision]]"</ref>

==Ownership==
Middle-earth Enterprises holds marketing and licensing rights for the titles ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and many proper names and short phrases from the books. As a consequence, they also own all stage and cinema rights to these two books, and the related merchandising rights.<ref>[[Chester N. Scoville]], "Estate", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pp. 175-6</ref>
