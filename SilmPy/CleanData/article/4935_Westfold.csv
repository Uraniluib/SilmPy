The '''Westfold''' was the western part of [[Rohan]], close to the [[White Mountains]] and lying between the river [[Isen]] and the [[Folde]]. The [[North-South Road]] ran through the Westfold from the [[Fords of Isen]] to [[Edoras]]. Its stronghold was [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The Westfold was originally part of the realm of [[Gondor]] until in {{TA|2510}} the fief of [[Calenardhon]] was granted to [[Eorl]] the Young by the [[Ruling Steward]] [[Cirion]]. Thereafter the Westfold was part of Rohan.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

In {{TA|2758|n}} the [[Dunlendings]] led by [[Wulf]] overran Rohan and King [[Helm]] took refuge in Helm's Deep.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> During the subsequent [[Long Winter]] first prince [[Háma]] and then Helm made sorties and forays into the Westfold for food and to attack their besiegers. Both men died in the snows.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

In the beginning of {{TA|3019|n}}, due to the threat of invasion by the forces of the wizard [[Saruman]], [[Théodred]], the son of King [[Théoden]], established himself at [[Helm's Deep]] to command the military strength of the Westfold. When actual war began Théodred added to the Muster of Westfold by summoning the [[Muster of Edoras]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>

On [[25 February]] the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] was fought.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> In this fight the sole objective of [[Saruman]] was to slay [[Théodred]]; had his forces invaded the Westfold immediately after this battle Rohan would have suffered grievously.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> Instead, Saruman's army withdrew and did not return until [[2 March]] to fight the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]].<ref name="Great"/>

Following the fall of Théodred, command in the [[West-mark]] was assumed by [[Erkenbrand]], who was Lord of [[Deeping-coomb]] and much of the rest of the Westfold. In the Second Battle the forces of Erkenbrand were scattered and Saruman's host marched through the Westfold to attack the [[Hornburg]]. However, in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] all of enemy were crushed.<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>

After the fall of [[Sauron]] the funeral escort of King Théoden rode to Edoras. Subsequently the remaining members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] traveled through the Westfold from [[14 August]] to [[22 August]] when King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] took his leave.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>
