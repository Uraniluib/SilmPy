'''Anárion''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "[[sun]]-son", pron. {{IPA|[aˈnaːri.on]}}, stem ''Anáriond-'') was the second son of [[Elendil]] and the brother of [[Isildur]].<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>  His son [[Meneldil]] was the last man born in [[Númenor]] before its [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]].<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}, Note 10</ref>

==History==
Anárion, together with his father and brother, were the leaders of the [[Faithful]], the small minority of [[Númenóreans]] that resisted the dark rule of King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] and his councilor [[Sauron]].  In {{SA|3319}} when Ar-Pharazôn assailed the land of [[Aman]],<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> nine ships of the Faithful escaped to the east (four for Elendil, three for Isildur, and two for Anárion).<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>  They were separated by the great storm that arose during the Downfall.  Elendil landed in northern [[Middle-earth]] near the Elven kingdom of [[Lindon]] and there established the realm of [[Arnor]].  Isildur and Anárion, however, landed in the south and founded the realm of [[Gondor]] in {{SA|3320|n}}.<ref name="Rings"/> 

Together, Anárion and Isildur were chiefly responsible for the early ordering of Gondor, and their thrones were set side by side in the Great Hall of [[Osgiliath]].  In the citiy of [[Minas Anor]] Anárion established his house while Isildur set up his in [[Minas Ithil]].

But Sauron also survived the Downfall of Númenor and reentered [[Mordor]] in {{SA|3320|n}}.<ref name="SA"/>  In {{SA|3429}} Sauron attacked Gondor with a force great enough to [[Fall of Minas Ithil|take Minas Ithil]] and force Isildur to flee.  Whilst Isildur, his wife and sons sailed from Gondor seeking Elendil’s aid, Anárion defended Osgiliath and was able to drive his forces back into the mountains.  Yet Sauron gathered greater strength and Anárion knew that without succor Gondor would fall.<ref name="Rings"/>

Aid did arrive when Elendil, Isildur, and the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]], in league with the Elven King [[Gil-galad]], formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and marched south.  Anárion joined the host in the plain between [[Cirith Gorgor]] and the [[Dead Marshes]] and fought in the 
[[Battle of Dagorlad]]. The Allies entered [[Mordor]] and laid the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], but Anárion was slain by a thrown rock in {{SA|3440|n}}.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Jef Murray - The Argonath.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jef Murray]] - ''The Argonath'']]
Anárion had four children, the youngest of whom was a son, [[Meneldil]].<ref group="Note">The records only state that Meneldil was Anárion's "4th child"; these would either be daughters or sons who died before Meneldil succeeded his uncle.</ref>  It is said that he was well-pleased at the departure of Isildur and his sons.<ref name="Gladden"/>  After the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], Meneldil became [[King of Gondor]] and the two realms in exile were estranged. 

Anárion's war-helm, which was also used as a crown, was crushed when he was killed. The war-helm of [[Isildur]] was used for the [[Crown of Gondor|crowning]] of the [[Kings of Gondor]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

The Line of Anárion lasted over two thousand years.  In honor of the founding co-rulers, when [[Rómendacil II]] built the [[Argonath]] he had the Pillars of the Kings carved in the likenesses of Anárion  and Isildur.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  Yet the line of Anárion dwindled and finally disappeared when King [[Eärnur]] died childless.  From that time forth the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Stewards]] ruled in the name of the House of Anárion.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', in Section VII "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]", [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained that there were three manuscripts in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the information about the Southern Line of Gondor, and from its condition it appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Anárion's date of birth was {{SA|3209}} instead of {{SA|3219}}. It was Isildur who was born in 3219 instead of 3209 and thus Anárion was the ''older'' of Elendil's two sons.<ref name="Elendil"/>
