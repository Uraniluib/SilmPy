The Beatles were [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]], and in the 1960s, they wanted to make their own adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. George Harrison wanted to play [[Gandalf]], [[Frodo Baggins]] was to be played by Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr to play the part of [[Samwise Gamgee]]. [[wikipedia:Twiggy|Twiggy]] was to appear as [[Galadriel]].
