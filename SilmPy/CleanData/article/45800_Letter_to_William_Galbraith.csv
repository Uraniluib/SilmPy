{{Blockquote|Having received a letter from William Galbraith dated [[7 March]] with questions about ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien immediately writes a reply, but mislays it and does not send it until [[13 April]]. He hopes that it may be possible to publish the index he had begun, as well as other things omitted from ''The Lord of the Rings'' for reasons of space and cost. All that now impedes the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is his finding time to prepare it.|<ref name=hammond/>}}
