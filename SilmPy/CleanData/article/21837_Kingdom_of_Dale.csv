The '''Kingdom of Dale''' was a kingdom in northern [[Rhovanion]] formed in the late [[Third Age]] by King [[Bard]] and populated by [[Northmen]].

== Geography ==
When it was founded the Kingdom of Dale consisted of the city of [[Dale]] and the valley of the [[River Running]] before the [[Front Gate|gates]] of the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>  By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] its boundaries extended far south and east of [[Lake-town]],<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref> all the way to the River [[Carnen]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Background==
The Township of Dale was formed by the [[Northmen]] soon after the year {{TA|2590}} when [[Thrór]] brought his people back to Erebor<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> and prospered with the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>  

In {{TA|2770|n}} during the time of Lord [[Girion]]<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref> [[Smaug]] attacked and occupied the Lonely Mountain<ref name="TA"/> and afterwards came ravaged the city eating its inhabitants; soon Dale was deserted and fell into ruin.<ref name="Party"/> [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], a descendant Girion slew Smaug in {{TA|2941}}.

== History ==
After the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and the recovery of the riches of the former lord, Bard became quite wealthy.  In {{TA|2944|n}} he used his wealth to found the Kingdom, and he was crowned as King Bard (later known as Bard I).<ref name="TA"/>

The Kingdom benefited by the simultaneous refounding of the Kingdom under the Mountain. After King Bard died in {{TA|2977|n}} his son King [[Bain]] reigned and in {{TA|3007|n}} he was succeeded by King [[Brand]].<ref name="TA"/>  As the end of the [[Third Age]] approached the growing realm extended far to the south and east of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref name="Meetings"/>

In {{TA|3017|n}} a messenger from [[Mordor]] came to both the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and the Kingdom of Dale.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>  Despite words offering [[Sauron]]'s friendship, the Dark Lord's forces began gathering beyond the Carnen.  About the same time that [[Minas Tirith]] was attacked (on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}) a host of Sauron's allies crossed the river and drove Brand back into Dale.  On [[17 March]] the [[Battle of Dale]] began.  King Brand and King [[Dáin Ironfoot]] of the Mountain were both killed and the [[Men of Dale]] and the Dwarves were driven into the Mountain.  The enemy could not take the gates and a siege began.  However, when news of the fall of Sauron came the enemy forces lost heart, and on [[27 March]] the new King of Dale, [[Bard II]], and the new [[King under the Mountain]], [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]], burst forth and drove the enemy away.

King Bard II sent an ambassador to the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]].  The Kingdom of Dale remained independent but in friendship with [[Gondor]] and under the protection and crown of the [[King of the West]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
