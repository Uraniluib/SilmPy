__NOTOC__
'''aen''' is a [[Sindarin]] word which probably means "should", "rather", "they" or generally a passive voice marker; its exact meaning, usage and etymology is unclear.
==Etymology==
The word is not easy to analyze. If its meaning is "should", there is a possibility that it is a cognate or related to the [[Quenya]] expression ''[[nai]]'', "may it be that".
==Example==
The word ''aen'' is seen in the phrase of the ''[[King's Letter]]''

*''[[i]] [[sennui]] "[[Panthael]]" [[esta]]thar [[aen]]''

This is translated as "who ought to be called 'Fullwise'"<ref>{{HM|SD}} p.126</ref> (referring to [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]]).

==Syntax==
''aen'' follows the verb ''estathar'', which is future tense and means "they will name". It is not known if ''aen'' can follow verbs of other tenses. Likewise, it is not known if ''aen'' is the pronoun ("'''they''' should name him Fullwiise"), a marker of the passive voice ("He should '''be called''' Fullwise"), or an optative marker which expresses a wish ("Whom instead '''should''' call Fullwise").

Another riddle is the word ''[[sennui]]'', which is also of unknown meaning, with possibilities being "should" or "instead".
