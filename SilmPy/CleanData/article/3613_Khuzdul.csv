'''Khuzdul''', or '''Dwarvish''', was the secret language of the [[Dwarves]].

==History==
[[Aulë]], the creator of the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]], taught them "the language he had devised for them". Not much is known of the language, as the Dwarves kept it to themselves. Being of secretive nature, they seldomly let aliens to hear it, and they didn't even reveal their true names to them.

Khuzdul is therefore unrelated in origin and different from the languages of the [[Elves]]. Few of other race have ever succeeded in learning it.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref><ref>{{App|Other}}</ref> The Dwarves weren't unwilling to teach Khuzdeul to their close friends, but Men found difficult to learn more than a few words, some of which loaned.<ref name=pmrel/> 

As such, there are many similarities between Khuzdul and the native tongues of men, such as [[Taliska|the language of the first and third houses]] of the [[Edain]]. This is because in the [[First Age]], before their ancestors crossed into [[Beleriand]], they had contact with the Dwarves in [[Rhovanion]] and later in the [[Blue Mountains]]. That language was the ancestor of [[Adûnaic]], the tongue of Númenor and the direct ancestor of the [[Westron|Common Speech]]. These [[Mannish]] languages displayed Khuzdul influences.

By their own will the Dwarves resisted its change<ref name=pmrel>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> and the language diversified and changed so slowly, 'like the  weathering of hard rock compared with the melting of snow'<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 26</ref> considering the languages even of the Elves. As a result, it remained similar to the original form taught by Aulë, and even if the sundered [[:Category:Dwarven clans|clans]] developed their own dialects, even in the [[Third Age]], the clans could communicate easily, serving as a ''lingua franca'' between them.<ref name=DM/>

During the Third Age the Dwarves of the [[Westlands]] had mostly adopted [[Westron]] and Khuzdul was a learned language, being taught to their children at an early age. They used it among themselves and as a language of books and lore, and for records not intended for outsiders.<ref name=DM>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

One of the only major phrases known to outsiders is their battle-cry: ''[[Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!]]'' meaning ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!''

==Naming==
The Dwarves were secretive by nature and their native names were considered too intimate to reveal to outsiders. In public life they took external names in the language of their surroundings. It is not known if these "outer" names are translations of their inner names, or whether they had any relation, or not. The [[Longbeards]] for example adopted [[Northern Mannish]] names.<ref>{{App|Languages}}</ref> Even [[Balin's Tomb]] displays these "outer" names of [[Balin]] and [[Fundin]], since there was always a possibility that the inscription would be read by strangers. Eventually they would make use of their "outer" names even among themselves.<ref name=DM/>

The Dwarves would re-adopt a name in consequence of some event, like a migration.<ref name=DM/>

==Writing==
It is said that the Dwarves had developed an ideographic or pictographic writing, until they came close to the [[Eldar]] and realized the usefulness of the alphabetic [[tengwar]] and [[cirth]] systems; this influence came especially the [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]] during the [[Second Age]]. The Dwarves didn't use written communication much but were fond of inscriptions cut in stone, and thus (even though the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] used runes only as a "matter of lore" mainly for formal writings) they found the cirth more practical.<ref name=DM/>

The Dwarves adopted and modified the cirth at various stages. By the [[Third Age]] the cirth were largely forgotten but by the Dwarves, so there was the misconception that the Dwarves invented them, known as "dwarf-letters".<ref name=DM/>

==Etymology==
The word ''Khuzdul'' (also spelled ''Khuzdûl'' in late manuscripts<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 321 (footnote 19)</ref><ref name=VT48>{{VT|48a}}, pp. 6, 24</ref>) is composed of the stem ''[[Khazâd|KH-Z-D]]'', and the adjectival or genitival ending ''-ul''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>

==Other names==

Other names used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] for the language of the Dwarves include:
*'''''Khazadian'''''<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}, p. 414</ref>
*'''''[[Aulëan|Aulian]]'''''<ref>{{HM|LR}}, pp. 179, 197</ref>
*'''''Nauglian'''''<ref>{{HM|LR}}, pp. 197, 277</ref>
*'''''Naukarin'''''<ref>{{PE|18}}, pp. 28-9, 81</ref>

==Influences==

Khuzdul appears to be structured, like the Semitic languages, around triconsonantal roots, such as ''kh-z-d'', ''b-n-d'', and ''z-g-l''.

The Dwarvish language sounds much like Hebrew, and indeed [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted some similarities between the Dwarves and  the Jews: both were "at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue&hellip;".<ref>{{L|176}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
===Neo-Khuzdul===
{{seealso|Neo-Elvish}}
For [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], the linguist [[David Salo]] used what little is known of Khuzdul to create enough of a language for use in the movies. This is usually referred to as neo-Khuzdul by [[Tolkienists]]. [[Gimli]] says the Neo-Khuzdul insult, ''Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul'', (commonly translated "I spit on your grave!") to [[Haldir]] in the extended edition of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''Fellowship of the Ring'']]. Salo did not provide this phrase, and it didn't fit easily into his neo-Khuzdul. When the scriptwriter for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]] asked him about it with the idea of having Thorin use the same curse, Salo reverse-engineered Gimli's line into a neo-Khuzdul phrase ''îsh kakhfê ai-‘d-dûr-rugnul'' meaning "May my excrement be poured upon the naked-jawed (ones)".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://midgardsmal.com/gimla-ok-thorins-bǫlvan/|articlename=Gimla ok Þorins bǫlvan|dated=20-06-2014|website=Midgardsmal|accessed=23-01-2017}}</ref>
