'''Maglor's Gap''' was the open area between the hills surrounding [[Himring]] and an extension of the [[Ered Luin]] just north of [[Rerir|Mount Rerir]].  It was the widest break in the northern mountain-fences of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

Due to the open terrain it was through this gap that [[Orcs]] entered East [[Beleriand]] before the [[Dagor Aglareb]].  In response the [[Noldor]] kept cavalry in the nearby plains, [[Caranthir]] fortified the mountains to the east of the gap (establishing his base beside Lake [[Helevorn]]), and [[Maedhros]] constructed his stronghold on the Hill of [[Himring]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

Most of these preparations came to naught during the [[Dagor Bragollach]].  The Orcs overwhelmed the Elves' cavalry upon the [[Lothlann]] and the dragon [[Glaurung]] passed through Maglor's Gap to destroy all of the land between the arms of [[Gelion]].  The fortresses upon Rerir's western slopes were destroyed and [[Thargelion]] was ravaged.  Only Himring was successfully defended, to which Maglor himself fled along with most survivors of the battle in that region.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
