As the Fellowship player maneuver Gandalf, Frodo, Aragorn and the rest of the Fellowship and their allies as they attempt to carry the Ring towards Mordor and its eventual destruction in the Cracks of Doom.

As the Enemy player hunt down and crush the pitiful forces of the Fellowship using your minions: Nazgul, Balrogs, Dragons, Giant Spiders, bands of Orcs and Trolls, assassins and other evil servants of Sauron. 

The Fellowship of the Ring is a two player game based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's three volume epic, The Lord of the Rings. Action focuses on the early periods as the Fellowship attempts to move the Ring from the Shire to the vicinity of Mordor. One player controls the forces of Sauron, the Dark Lord; while the other player controls the Fellowship characters and their allies. 

The game uses special cards and plastic markers to implement deployment and hidden movement. The cards and markers even allow certain combats to be resolved without revealing the identities of the combatants. The Fellowship player attempts to avoid, deceive, and misdirect the Enemy player while moving towards Mordor. The Enemy player attempts to force the Fellowship player into combat where the Ring can be retrieved for its rightful master, Sauron of Mordor. 

The rules are organized for a standard scenario and basic game; however optional rules are included for simpler and advanced games.

This game contains: 
*21"x26" full color mounted mapboard of Tolkien's Middle Earth 
*222 illustrated playing cards 
*65 plastic playing pieces 
*40 diecut counters 
*Rulesbook, card displays, charts and tables
