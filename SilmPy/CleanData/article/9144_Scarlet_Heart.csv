In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s earlier work ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', the '''Scarlet Heart''' was the heart of [[Finwë]], then [[Turgon|Turgon's]] father, cut out by [[orcs]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 241</ref>  It was regained by Turgon, and made the emblem of his [[House of the King|House]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, Note 27, p. 200</ref>

If this story survived to be Tolkien's "[[final intent]]", then the heart would probably be that of Fingon, Turgon's brother.  Finwë was slain by [[Morgoth]] himself in Aman, Fingolfin's body was taken away by Thorondor before Morgoth could desecrate it, and Fëanor's body turned to ashes after death.  But altogether it is doubtful that Tolkien ever kept this story, but changed or abandoned it with much of the other material found in the ''Fall''.
