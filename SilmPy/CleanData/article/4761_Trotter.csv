In the earliest unpublished versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character who became [[Aragorn]] was called '''Trotter''' instead of [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] and was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] instead of [[Man]]. His name was derived from the fact that he had wooden feet after being tortured in [[Mordor]]. The background of Trotter is explained in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', volume IX, ''[[Sauron Defeated]]''.
