'''Southern Star''' was a variety of pipe-weed grown in the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]], and apparently originating in the district around [[Longbottom]]. The 'star' of its name presumably refers to the star-shaped flowers of the [[pipe-weed]] plant.<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the second (out of seven) drafts of [[The Lord of the Rings Prologue]], "Southern Star" was originally named "Hornpipe Twist".<ref>{{PM|Prologue}}, p. 6</ref>
