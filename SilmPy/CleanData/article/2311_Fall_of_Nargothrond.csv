The '''Fall of Nargothrond''' was the overthrow and destruction of the city by that name, wrought by [[Glaurung]] and his hordes, in {{FA|495}}.

==Prelude==
{{main|Battle of Tumhalad}}
After hearing reports of a great mustering of Orcs under the shadow of [[Ered Wethrin]], [[Túrin]] counselled the King, [[Orodreth]], to meet them in open battle. The army of [[Nargothrond]] went forth to meet them in the field of [[Tumhalad]] and were utterly defeated. The Orc-host led by [[Glaurung]] then moved towards the hidden stronghold.

==The battle==
The guards of Nargothrond were aware of what had happened in Tumhalad but were powerless to stop the assault of Glaurung and the [[Orcs]]. Glaurung unleashed his fire upon the [[Doors of Felagund]] and passed through. The great halls and chambers were plundered and destroyed, those with arms were driven off or killed and the women and maidens, including Orodreth's daughter [[Finduilas]], were herded to be taken as slaves to [[Angband]].

Coming late to the sack were Túrin and some few other survivors of the [[Battle of Tumhalad]]. At the sight of the Dragon, Túrin's followers fled, but Túrin himself fell under Glaurung's dragon-spell, and forced to watch as the captives were driven away. Then Glaurung released Túrin, knowing the evils this would cause.

==Aftermath==
The captives were taken away towards [[Angband]] but Glaurung stayed and destroyed the bridge over the [[Narog]]. He gathered all the treasures of the city and laid upon them and rested.
