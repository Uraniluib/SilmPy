'''Scary''' was a small settlement that lay in the hilly region of caves and rock holes that formed the northern parts of the [[Eastfarthing]], which also gave its name to the surrounding [[Hills of Scary|stony hills]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

From among the rocky lands around Scary much of [[the Shire]]'s stone was quarried. 

During the [[War of the Ring]], the Scary quarries were used by [[Ruffians|Sharkey's Men]] to store their loot, and after Sharkey was defeated, much of this was recovered by the [[Shire-hobbits]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that the name was meaningless in [[Hobbitish]] of the [[War of the Ring]]. However he notes that since it was in a rocky region and of a stone-quarry, it may be supposed to contain English dialectal ''scar'', "rocky cliff".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref>

Based on the above, [[David Salo]] has suggested that Scary represents a speculative [[Old English]] *''Skerig'' "precipitous (place)". Salo also noted that the form of this dialectal word, specifically the existence of sk-, reveals a [[Norse]] origin.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

[[Tom Shippey]] suggests an etymology from Old English ''scearu'' "a boundary", marking the Shire's northern boundary; the retaining (or reversal) of /sk/ might reflect the peculiarity of [[Wikipedia:Northern English|Northern English]] (in such names as [[Wikipedia:Skipton|Skipton]], [[Wikipedia:Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]).<ref>[[Jason Fisher]], ed., ''[[Tolkien and the Study of His Sources]]'', p. 11</ref>
