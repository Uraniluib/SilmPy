==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go
To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow,
And many miles be still to go,
But under a tall tree I will lie,
And let the clouds go sailing by.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Hey Ho to the bottle I go
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow but there'll still be
Many miles to go

Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain,
And the stream that falls from hill to plain.
Better than rain or rippling brook,
Is a mug of beer inside this [[Took Family|Took]].
</poem>
