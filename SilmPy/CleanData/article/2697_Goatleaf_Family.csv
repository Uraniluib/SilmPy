The '''Goatleaf Family''' were a family of the [[Men]] of [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> As was typical among the Men of that region, the name comes from a plant.  

[[Harry Goatleaf]] at one time watched the [[West-gate of Bree]], but threw in his lot with [[Bill Ferny]] and [[Saruman]]'s thugs during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It is linked to [[Wikipedia:honeysuckle|honeysuckle]] or [[Wikipedia:woodbine|woodbine]]. Its French name, ''ch√®vrefeuille'' is also a medieval lay, and would therefore presumably have been familiar to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 758</ref>
