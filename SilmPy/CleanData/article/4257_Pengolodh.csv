'''Pengolodh''' was a [[Loremaster]] of the [[Noldor]] in [[Gondolin]].

==History==
Pengolodh was an [[Elves|Elf]], born in [[Nevrast]] to a [[Noldor|Noldorin]] lord and a [[Sindar|Sindarin]] lady; when [[Turgon]] built his Hidden City in [[Tumladen]], he moved with his people there. As a member of the [[Lambengolmor]], he was known as the "Sage of the Noldor", and counted as the greatest Loremaster since [[Fëanor]] and [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]].<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 396-7</ref>

Pengolodh escaped the sack of the city with [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], and followed them to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=Quendi/> The ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'' are attributed to him, as well as the edited ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]'' (furthering the work of Rúmil).

It was during his stay at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees of [[Doriath]], he made copies and extracts of documents written in [[Cirth]],<ref name=Quendi/> possibly preserving them as an active writing system; possibly he must have stayed in [[Lindon]] for at least a while after the [[War of Wrath]], so that the [[Dúnedain]] could copy his work.

Later, in the [[Second Age]], he dwelt in the Kingdom of [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]],<ref name=Quendi/> where he might have learned [[Khuzdul]].<ref group=note>The essay "[[Quendi and Eldar]]" never explicitly mentions that Pengolodh was taught Khuzdul, but in a different account of his life it is stated that he learned Khuzdul "''in its archaic form as used in the habitations of the Dwarves in [[Blue Mountains|Ered Lindon]]''" ({{VT|48a}}, p. 6 (Note 3)).</ref> It was during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] and after the fall of [[Eregion]] when Pengolodh left [[Middle-earth]] for [[Tol Eressëa]], last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.<ref name=Quendi/>

Ages later, he accepted [[Ælfwine]] the traveler and taught him about the Elves and the [[Elder Days]]. Some of their discussions were recorded as ''[[Dangweth Pengoloð]]''.

==Etymology==

The [[Sindarin]] name ''Pengolodh'' is glossed as "'teaching sage', doctor of lore".<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 139</ref> The [[Quenya]] version of his name was '''''Quendingoldo''''' or '''''Quengoldo'''''.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, pp. 401, 404-5</ref><ref>{{VT|48a}}, pp. 5, 14</ref>

''Pengolodh'' consists of the words ''[[ben|pen]]'' and ''[[golodh]]''.{{fact}} 

''Pengolodh'' also appears spelled '''''Pengolod''''', '''''Pengoloð''''',<ref name=PE17/> '''''Pengoloth''''', and '''''Pengoloþ''''' — the ending in all cases representing the voiced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_fricative same sound].{{fact}}

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Pengolodh does not appear in any of the canon works of Middle-earth, but in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' he is given as the author of many works, including the ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'', a work which was developed by Tolkien at the same time as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and from which [[Christopher Tolkien]] drew much information to establish the published ''Silmarillion''. Various late essays by Tolkien dealing with linguistics are presented as being the work of Pengolodh, including the remarkable work ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''.

Because of Pengolodh's nature as a literary device, he does not appear actively as a protagonist in any of the stories. All information about his life come from biographical notes written by Tolkien.

Early Tolkien texts stated that, after removing to Tol Eressëa, Pengolodh lived in a village called ''[[Tavrobel]]'' (or ''Tathrobel''). Centuries later [[Ælfwine]] spoke with him there. The figure of [[Gilfanon]], which fulfilled a similar role as a chronicler of the annals of Beleriand in earlier works, probably became this character as well in Tolkien's mind.<ref>{{LR|Appendix}}</ref>
