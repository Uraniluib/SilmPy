'''Imin''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈimin]}}) was the first [[Elves|Elf]] who [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]] at [[Cuiviénen]] and one of the three [[Elf-fathers]]. His [[Wives of the Elf-Fathers|spouse]] was [[Iminyë]].

Imin wandered with the two other Fathers [[Tata]] and [[Enel]] until they found a group of 12 sleeping Elves which he took with him. The Clan was named after him [[Minyar]], the "Firsts". 

In the [[Cuivienyarna]], Imin is portrayed as arrogant, due to him being the first Elf to awake. In the process he is seen to be seeking more Elven followers for his clan, and lastly being left with the fewest.

Thereafter, he refused to take the other Elves that they found, hoping to find some group larger than the ones claimed by the other Fathers. However, despite his expectations they found none other and his clan remained with only 14 members.

The clan was later named [[Vanyar]].<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 380-1</ref>
