==Summary==
Mrs. Scott was on a campaign against [[Ace Books]], who had produced a pirate edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the United States. Tolkien thanked her, because he didn't have time to fight pirate editions himself, and informed her that he was in negotiations with [[Ballantine Books]] about an authorized paperback, to be released in the US.
