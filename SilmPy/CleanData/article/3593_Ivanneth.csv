'''Ivanneth''' was the name among the [[Dúnedain]] for the ninth month of the year, more commonly known in [[Middle-earth]] by its [[Quenya]] title, [[Yavannië]], and approximately equivalent to modern September.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

The month of Ivanneth in the second year of the [[Third Age]] is historically important as the time when [[Isildur]] set out from [[Osgiliath]] to ride for the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] of the Dúnedain. Before the month was out, he and his companions were set upon by [[Orcs]] out of the autumn-coloured trees of [[Mirkwood]], and the [[The One Ring|Ring]] Isildur bore was lost in the [[Anduin|Great River]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Its name comes from the words ''[[yávë]]'' ("fruit") and ''[[anna]]'' ("gift"), a reference to the harvests of autumn, and connected to the name of [[Yavanna]], the [[Valar|Vala]] of earth and growth.
