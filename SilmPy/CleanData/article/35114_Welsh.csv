'''Welsh''' is the [[Celtic]] language spoken throughout Wales and some nearby parts of England. [[Mark T. Hooker]] observes that "Tolkien's definition of Welsh does not exactly coincide with the modern perceptions of the word. When Tolkien says Welsh, it is as a portmanteau that includes Cornish and Breton as well."<ref name=TW>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[Tolkien and Welsh]]''</ref>{{rp|1}}

==Sindarin==
{{quote|The names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh (closely similar but not identical). This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it.|J.R.R. Tolkien<ref>{{HM|MC}}, p. 197</ref>}}
 
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] admits to have been greatly inspired by Welsh when creating the [[Elvish]] language [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 40</ref> Several similarities have been pointed out:

===Singular/Plural===
Editor [[Carl F. Hostetter]] has noted that the singular form ''[[lotheg]]'' is formed by the addition of a diminuitive/singular ending ''-eg/-ig'' to the plural form ''[[loth]]'', much like in Welsh where a singular noun can derive "from a plural form by the addition of a singular ending".<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 30 (note 42)</ref>
===[[Lenition]]===
