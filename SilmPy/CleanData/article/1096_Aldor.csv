}}'''Aldor the Old''' ([[Third Age 2544]] – {{TA|2645|n}}, aged 101 years) was the third King of [[Rohan]].<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref> 
==History==
Aldor was the second son of King [[Brego]], but became the heir to the throne when his older brother [[Baldor]] vanished in {{TA|2569}}, in an attempt to tread the [[Paths of the Dead]].  His father [[Brego]] died of grief in {{TA|2570|n}} so Aldor then became the King of Rohan.  He reigned for seventy-five years, the longest of any ruler of Rohan, and became known as Aldor the Old.

During his reign the population of the [[Rohirrim]] increased.  The remaining [[Dunlendings]] east of the [[Isen]] River were either driven out or subdued, and [[Harrowdale]] and other valleys in the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]] were settled. 

Aldor had three daughters before his first son, [[Fréa]], was born.<ref name="Mark"/>

==Etymology==
Aldor seems to come from the [[Old English]] ''ealdor'', meaning "Prince, Chief, Lord".<ref>[[James W. Bright]] (ed.), [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/goth-saxon/bright-oe.html James W. Bright's Glossary of the Anglo-Saxon Language]</ref> It is also possible that his name means "elder" (cf. [[Orald]]) consistent to his longevity.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', The Giving of Names p.214</ref>
