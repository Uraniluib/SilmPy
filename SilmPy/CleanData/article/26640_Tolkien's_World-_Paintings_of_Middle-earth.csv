'''''Tolkien's World: Paintings of Middle-earth''''' is a 1992 book collecting various pieces of art inspired by the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Each painting is accompanied by a page of text drawn from the work that inspired it. Artists include [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[John Howe]], [[Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], and others. Due to the success of this book, in [[1996]] ''[[Realms of Tolkien]]'' was published, featuring even more art.

==From the publisher==
[[Middle-earth]], the world created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in his timeless classics ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', has been an inspiration for generations of artists. This beautiful volume of artwork celebrates the legacy of his imagination. ''Tolkien's World'' includes paintings by artists from all over the world. From the powerful depictions of the darker side of Middle-earth by [[John Howe]], to the evocative landscapes by [[Alan Lee]]; from [[Michael Hague]]'s delightful paintings in ''The Hobbit'' to the strange and compelling vision of [[Roger Garland]]; from the engaging simplicity of [[Inger Edelfeldt]]'s work to the intricacy of dramatic realism of [[Ted Nasmith]] - Tolkien's World spans the whole of Middle-earth. Each painting is accompanied by a page of text drawn from the book that inspired it, describing the scene the artist has chosen to illustrate. Also included is a short essay by each of the artists about Tolkien's influence upon them.
