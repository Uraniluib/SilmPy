==Etymology==
The word '''''inziladûn''''' is an [[Adûnaic]] word that could mean "flower of the west", derived from ''[[inzil]]'', "flower", and ''[[adûn]]'', "west".

However, as ''inzil'' comes first, it is standing in object position; the meaning actually is "West of the Flower".<ref>http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html</ref>
