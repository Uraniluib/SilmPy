[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Amon Ereb.jpg|right|thumb|"Amon Ereb" by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]'''Amon Ereb''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. ''[[amon]]'' "hill" + ''[[ereb]]'' "isolated, lonely"), sometimes just '''Ereb''', was the broad, shallow-sided hill that dominated the southern plains of [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

The hill was the highest point in that region and the easternmost hill of [[Andram]], but was standing alone. Within sight of the [[Gelion]], it had tremendous strategic importance, because it guarded the eastern passage around the Long Wall of the Andram into the southern parts of [[East Beleriand]] and the northern [[Taur-im-Duinath]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

It was here that [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] of the [[Nandor]] met his end in the [[First Battle]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>  Much later, [[Caranthir]] fortified it to guard his escape into the south after the [[Dagor Bragollach]]<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> and the Fëanorions withdrew there after [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{WJ|11}}</ref>
==Fate==
[[File:Didier Willis - Mount Dolmed and Amon Ereb.png|thumb|Collage of maps showing where Amon Ereb would be (if surviving the submersion of [[Beleriand]]).]]
A small circle appears in [[Forlindon]] on Tolkien's early draft map for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 302</ref> Christopher Tolkien cannot explain this feature<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 301</ref> and notes that in his own 1943 redrawn map, the circular area is no longer present.<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 322</ref> If one does a correct collage of Beleriand and Eriador maps, however, the small circular map seems to coincide with Amon Ereb.<ref>See notably the maps independently reconstructed by [[Charles Noad]], "A Note on the Geography of the First Age" in ''[[Amon_Hen_(journal)|Amon Hen]]'' no. [[Amon_Hen_38|38]], April 1979, reprinted in ''[[Mallorn_(journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn_27|27]], September 1990, p. 40; [[Ronald Kyrmse]], "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in ''[[Mallorn_(journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn_26|26]], September 1989, pp. 25–27; [[Didier Willis]], "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" (French) in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'' (2014), vol. 2, pp. 197-212.</ref> This might suggest that Amon Ereb was once thought to have survived the submersion of Beleriand, although there is no textual evidence for it.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''

In MERP, Amon Ereb does indeed survive the destruction of [[Beleriand]].
