==From the cover/back==

"One marvels anew at the depth, breadth, and persistence of J.R.R. Tolkien's labor. No one sympathetic to his aims, the invention of a secondary universe, will want to miss this chance to be present at the creation." -- ''Publishers Weekly''

"An opportunity, rarely granted readers, to see the creative process at work". -- ''Hartford Courant''

"Christopher Tolkien's notes and commentary are exhaustive, impeccable, and indispensable." -- ''Mythprint''

''The End of the Third Age'' is comprised of the first section of the hardcover volume published as ''Sauron Defeated'', the ninth volume of ''The History of Middle-earth''. It completes Christopher Tolkien's account of the creation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' begun in the earlier volumes, ''The Return of the Shadow'', ''The Treason of Isengard'', and ''The War of the Ring''.

''The End of the Third Age'' begins with Sam's rescue of Frodo from the Tower of Kirith Ungol, and giving a very different account of the Scouring of the Shire, this part ends with versions of the hitherto unpublished Epilogue, in which, years after the departure of Bilbo and Frodo from the Grey Havens, Sam attempts to answer his children's questions.

The book is illustrated with changing conceptions of Kirith Ungol and Mount Doom, as well as previously unpublished drawings of Orthanc and Dunharrow.

J.R.R. TOLKIEN (1892-1973) is one of the twentieth century's best-loved writers. His books, which include ''The Hobbit'', ''The Lord of the Rings'', and ''The Silmarillion'', have been translated into more than thirty languages and have sold many millions of copies worldwide.

CHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN, who formerly taught at Oxford University, is J.R.R. Tolkien's son and literary executor. The editor of ''The Silmarillion'' and ''Unfinished Tales'', he lives in France.
