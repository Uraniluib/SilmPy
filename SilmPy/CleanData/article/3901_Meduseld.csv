'''Meduseld''' was the great '''Golden Hall''' that stood upon a green terrace in [[Edoras]]. It was topped with a straw roof, which made it appear as if it was made out of gold when seen from far off. Its walls were richly decorated with tapestries depicting the history and legends of the [[Rohirrim]], and it served as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisers, and a feast hall.<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

==History==
After the [[Éothéod]] had settled in [[Rohan]], the [[Kings of Rohan|Second King of Rohan]], [[Brego]] son of [[Eorl]], built a great hall on top of the hill of Edoras. The hall was completed in {{TA|2569}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

In {{TA|2758|n}} the [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] leader, [[Wulf]], took Edoras and Meduseld and proclaimed himself king. [[Helm Hammerhand]]'s son [[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]] fell defending the doors of the great hall. Wulf was eventually overthrown by [[Fréaláf]], son of [[Hild]], in {{TA|2759|n}}.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

In the late [[Third Age]], Meduseld was the home of King [[Théoden]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> On [[7 August]] {{TA|3019}} Théoden's body was brought to Meduseld<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> where he lay until his funeral three days later.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''Meduseld'', in the [[Old English]], means "Mead Hall" having a connotation of "Hall of feasts"; ''medu'' means "mead" but as a word it has connotations to "joy".

==Inspiration==
In many ways Meduseld is inspired by [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] poetry, particularly ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', which contains the mead-hall [[Wikipedia:Heorot|Heorot]] — the "golden hall" of King [[Wikipedia:Hrothgar|Hrothgar]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John Garth]]|articleurl=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/05/j-r-r-tolkien-beowulf-one-mans-passion-threshold-between-myth-and-reality|articlename=J R R Tolkien's Beowulf: one man's passion for the threshold between myth and reality|dated=29 May 2014|website=[http://www.newstatesman.com/ newstatesman.com]|accessed=29 May 2014}}</ref> The description of "the light of it shines far across the land" is one of the lines from this poem.
