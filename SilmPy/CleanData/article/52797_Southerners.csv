'''"Southerners"''' are an ill-defined group of people, generally referred to as such by [[Men of Bree|Bree-landers]]. These men came up from the [[Greenway]] into [[Bree]] out of lands to the south around [[Dunland]]. They had come up into the [[Bree-land|Bree-lands]] looking for a place of peace from the unrest in their homes, though a few such as the [[Squint-eyed Southerner]] were in fact spies of [[Saruman]] and were not to be trusted.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
