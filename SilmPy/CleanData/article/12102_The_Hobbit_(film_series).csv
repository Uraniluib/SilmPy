==Development==
===Origins===
[[Peter Jackson]] and [[Fran Walsh]] first considered the possibility of filming ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in [[1995]]. They hoped to produce three films, the first based on ''The Hobbit'', with the second and third films being adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult to secure because whilst [[Saul Zaentz]] owned the production rights, [[United Artists]] held the distribution rights. After much wrangling with studios and the script, filming began for the three-film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings''. The notion of a ''Hobbit'' film was consequently put to one side. Indeed, after completing his ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy project, Jackson was averse to the idea of directing an adaptation of ''The Hobbit''.<ref name="HobbitOfficialMovieGuide">[[Brian Sibley]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Official Movie Guide]]'' (2012)</ref>

{{Blockquote|If I were to make these films, I would be frustrated because I would be constantly thinking about what I had done on ''The Lord of the Rings''. I would somehow feel that I had to build or improve on that. I thought it would be a fairly unsatisfying experience to have to compete against my own movies.|[[Peter Jackson]]<ref name="HobbitOfficialMovieGuide"/>}}

===Directorship===
The apathy of [[Peter Jackson]] was the first obstacle to block the way to a ''Hobbit'' film (or films). In early [[2005]] it came to public attention that Jackson was suing [[New Line Cinema]].<ref name="BBCNewsPJSues">{{webcite|articleurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4312463.stm|articlename=Director sues over Rings profits|dated=2-Mar-2005|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref> This cast doubt on whether or not The Hobbit would ever be made. Jackson later told fans that, due to the dispute, he would neither direct nor produce the film.<ref name="BBCNewsPJSues" /> In late 2007 it was confirmed that Jackson would not direct, but ''would'' be an executive producer for two Hobbit movies.<ref name="BBCNewsPJProducer">{{webcite|articleurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7150644.stm|articlename=Jackson to produce Hobbit movies|dated=18-Dec-2007|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref> It was later announced that [[Guillermo del Toro]] would direct the films, and that Jackson will be an active 'executive producer' with the possibility that he would help direct some scenes if necessary.<ref name="BBCNewsGdTDirector">{{webcite|articleurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7366375.stm|articlename=Del Toro to direct Hobbit movies|dated=25-April-2008|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref>

However, on [[30 May]] [[2010]] it was revealed that del Toro could no longer commit himself to direct ''The Hobbit'' films, citing the continued delays in production in his reasoning.<ref name="BBCNewsGdTDirectorLeave">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10204138|articlename=Guillermo del Toro 'leaves' as director of The Hobbit|dated=1-June-2010|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref> Peter Jackson later announced that he would direct both films.<ref name="NZHPJDirector">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10681008|articlename=The Hobbit gets green light, Jackson to direct|dated=16-Oct-2010|website=[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/ NZ Herald News]|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref>

===The Tolkien Estate's legal action against New Line Cinema===
{{Blockquote|The estate has [...] asked for a court order giving them the ability to terminate any rights the studio have to make films based on other Tolkien works, including The Hobbit.|BBC News Online<ref name="BBCNewsTELegal"/>}}
Production of ''The Hobbit'' films was held up by the [[Tolkien Estate|Tolkien Estate's]] legal action against [[New Line Cinema]]. The Estate should have received 7.5 per cent of all profits from the films under the agreement made by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] with United Artists in [[1969]]. Crucially, they also sought to stop the production of ''The Hobbit'' films until the case was settled.<ref name="BBCNewsTELegal">{{webcite|articleurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7240421.stm|articlename=Rings film studio sued for $150m|dated=12-Feb-2009|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref> The legal row was finally settled in September [[2009]] after the Tolkien Estate successfully sued New Line Cinema for breach of contract and fraud, receiving a reported $220 million in compensation.<ref name="BBCNewsTELegalSettle">{{webcite|articleurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8245300.stm|articlename=Legal path clear for Hobbit movie|dated=8-September-2009|website=BBC|accessed=11-Feb-2012}}</ref>

===Industrial dispute in New Zealand===
Even before the issue of the directorship had been settled, and before the project was given the go-ahead by the studios, the International Federation of Actors (IFA) told actors to actively avoid participation in the production of ''The Hobbit'' films.<ref name="BBCIndustrial1">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11414204|articlename=Union tell actors to avoid Hobbit films|dated=26-September-2010|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> The IFA issued this "Do Not Work Order", on [[24 September]], [[2010]], on the basis that the studios refused to engage in union-negotiated contracts.<ref name="FIADNW">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.aftra.org/4AB692BB8467439D83C12A8A2C44B077.htm|articlename=FIA Do Not Work Order: 'The Hobbit'|dated=24-September-2010|website=[http://www.aftra.org/ The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> Meanwhile the studios argued that they could not make an agreement with a trade union under New Zealand law.<ref name="BBCIndustrial1"/>

[[Peter Jackson]] subsequently warned that the dispute could lead to a huge delay and that production could easily transfer to Eastern Europe.<ref name="BBCIndustrial2">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11417340|articlename=Peter Jackson threatens Hobbit shutdown|dated=27-September-2010|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> John Key, the incumbent Prime Minister of New Zealand, weighed in on the dispute saying that he hoped the dispute would not force ''The Hobbit'' production to move overseas.

With the studios seriously considering moving the production abroad, large numbers of New Zealanders protested in Auckland, [[Wellington]], and Christchurch.<ref name="BBCIndustrial5">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11617860|articlename=New Zealanders rally behind Hobbit shoot|dated=25-October-2012|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> A settlement was finally reached on [[27 October]], [[2010]], with the Prime Minister himself announcing the news, hoping to prevent the loss of jobs in New Zealand and to reinforce the country's Tolkien tourism industry.<ref name=BBCIndustrial6>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11633724|articlename=The Hobbit will be made in New Zealand, PM confirms|dated=27-October-2012|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> As part of the agreement, the New Zealand government passed legislation which clarified that film industry workers are independent contractors rather than employees.<ref name="BBCIndustrial7>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11649734|articlename=Hobbit legislation passed in New Zealand|dated=29-October-2010|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref> Filming finally began on [[21 March]], [[2011]].<ref name="BBCNews1"/>

===Film Three===
The original plan was to produce two films, entitled ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'' and ''The Hobbit: There and Back Again'' (to be released in [[14 December]] [[2012]] and [[13 December]] [[2013]] respectively).<ref name="HBTitles"/>

At [[Wikipedia:San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2012, [[Peter Jackson]] revealed that he hoped to film more material (based on [[The Appendices]]) in [[2013]]; this led to speculation that there could be a third "Hobbit" film.

On [[30 July]], [[2012]], [[Peter Jackson]] announced that there would indeed be a third "Hobbit" film.

==Technical details==
===3D===
[[File:John Howe and Alan Lee - 3D concept art.png|thumb|left|3D concept art by [[John Howe]] and [[Alan Lee]]]]
''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'', ''The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug'', and ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' were filmed in 3D using [[Wikipedia:Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED Epic]] cameras. A rig designed by [[Wikipedia:3ality Technica|3ality Technica]] is being used in the filming of the three films; here two cameras and a mirror are used in order to achieve an intraocular effect similar to that of a human's (the distance between the eyes). This is how the depth required for 3D film is achieved.<ref name="ProductionVideo4">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10150451523596807|articlename=THE HOBBIT, Production Video #4|dated=4-Nov-2011|website=FB|accessed=10-Feb-2012}}</ref>

Most of [[John Howe|John Howe's]] and [[Alan Lee|Alan Lee's]] concept art has continued to be produced in 2D. However, they have collaborated on 3D pieces using the simple red and blue 3D effect.<ref name="ProductionVideo4"/>

===48 frames per second===
Breaking with conventional filming techniques, ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'', ''The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug'', and ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' are being filmed by capturing 48 frames per second (FPS), twice the normal film standard of 24 frames per second. This makes the film look far more realistic. When describing what people thought when they saw clips of ''The Hobbit'' shown at 48 frames per second, Peter Jackson said that it's 'like the back of the cinema has had a hole cut out of it where the screen is and you're actually looking into the real world'.<ref name="ProductionVideo4"/>

Jackson later discussed the advantages of filming at higher frame rate and in 3D.

{{Blockquote|Now, in the digital age, there’s no reason whatsoever to stick to 24 fps. [...] Science tells us that the human eye stops seeing individual pictures at about 55 fps. Therefore, shooting at 48 fps gives you much more of an illusion of real life. The reduced motion blur on each frame increases sharpness and gives the movie the look of having been shot in 65mm or IMAX. One of the biggest advantages is the fact that your eye is seeing twice the number of images each second, giving the movie a wonderful immersive quality. It makes the 3D experience much more gentle and hugely reduces eyestrain. Much of what makes 3D viewing uncomfortable for some people is the fact that each eye is processing a lot of strobing, blur and flicker. This all but disappears in HFR 3D.|[[Peter Jackson]]<ref name="PJHFR3D">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/qa-on-hfr-3d/10151299493836558|articlename=Q&A ON HFR 3D|dated=19-November-2012|website=FB|accessed=19-November-2012}}</ref>}}

Additionally, the ''The Hobbit'' films are being filmed at a 5K resolution. This is substantially larger than the conventional 1080 HD resolution. The films are being filmed digitally onto 128 GB memory cards that fit into the RED Epic camera.<ref name="ProductionVideo4"/>

One of the drawbacks of filming 48 frames per second at 5K resolution is that the make-up, prosthetic, prop, set, and costume departments have to work differently. For example, the make-up and prosthetic departments have to redden up the faces of the actors much more than usual because otherwise their skin colour will turn up yellow on the final film. Furthermore, real hair has to be used in order to achieve an authentic look when it moves around.<ref name="ProductionVideo4"/>

Ten minutes of footage was shown at 48 FPS during the [[Warner Bros.]] presentation at [[Wikipedia:CinemaCon|CinemaCon]] [[2012]]. The reaction was mixed. The ''Los Angeles Times'' described the picture as 'hyper-realistic' and the Associated Press described 'vivid, with grass blades, facial lines and soaring mountains appearing luminous and pronounced. The actors looked almost touchable, as if they were performing live on stage'. However, an anonymous projectionist said that '[i]t looked like a made-for-TV movie'.<ref name="BBC48FPS">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17836380|articlename=Peter Jackson unveils new Hobbit footage|dated=25-April-2012|website=BBC|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref><ref name="LAT48FPS">{{webcite|articleurl=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/04/cinemacon-hobbit-frame-rate-depp-gatsby.html|articlename=CinemaCon: Footage of 'The Hobbit' draws mixed reaction|dated=24-April-2012|website=[http://www.latimes.com/ ''Los Angeles Times'']|accessed=31-July-2012}}</ref>

==Games and merchandise==
===Video games===
In late [[2011]], the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] would release a video game based on ''The Hobbit'' in lieu of the release of ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' in December [[2012]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Ben Fritz|articleurl=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/18/business/la-fi-1018-ct-warner-interactive-20111018/2|articlename=Warner's approach to video games is paying off|dated=18 October 2011|website=[http://www.latimes.com/ ''Los Angeles Times'']|accessed=2 March 2012}}</ref> 

In September [[2012]], [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] announced that it would produce two free-to-play video games, in co-operation with [[Kabam]].
