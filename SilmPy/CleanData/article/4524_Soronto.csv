'''Soronto''' was a [[Man]] of the [[Line of Elros|royal lineage]] of [[Númenor]], the grandson of [[Tar-Meneldur]] and son of [[Ailinel]], a sister of [[Tar-Aldarion]]. He lived during the later years of the first millennium of the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{UT|earlier}}</ref> His father was [[Orchaldor]], a descendant of the [[House of Hador]].<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Before Tar-Aldarion changed the [[Law of Succession in Númenor]] only the son of the King could be the King's heir or, if he had no son, then the nearest male kinsman of male descent from [[Elros]] Tar-Minyatur would be King.  This meant that [[Malantur]] (grandson of [[Tar-Elendil]]'s younger brother [[Eärendur (son of Tar-Amandil)|Eärendur]]) was in line for the Sceptre.  After Tar-Aldarion changed the law, his daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]] could become the ruler of Númenor. But because of a clause in the changed law that said that the [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queen]] had to marry in order to keep her position and could not die childless, Soronto apparently remained hopeful of receiving the [[Sceptre]].  However, despite [[Tar-Ancalimë]]'s reluctance to wed, she did eventually marry, to spite Soronto and kept him from taking her place.  Once her son [[Tar-Anárion|Anárion]] was born Soronto's hopes were completely dashed.<ref name="Wife"/>

==Etymology==
Soronto's name apparently means "Man of the Eagle" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[soron]]'', 'eagle', and the masculine suffix ''[[-to]]'').
