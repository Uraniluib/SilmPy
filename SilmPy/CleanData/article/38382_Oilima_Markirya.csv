'''''Oilima Markirya''''' ("'''The Last Ark'''") is the title of a [[Qenya]]/[[Quenya]] poem (with English translation) by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], originally published in the essay "[[A Secret Vice]]" (in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'').

Two additional versions of the poem also appeared in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'', one called "the first version", and one likely dating from "the last decade" of Tolkien's life.

Draft versions of ''Oilima Markirya'', together with comments, were published in [[Parma Eldalamberon 16|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 16]].

[[Helge Fauskanger]] used the early ([[1931]]) and late versions of the first stanza of the poem to display the evolution of Tolkien's revisions in Quenya.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm|articlename=Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=}}</ref>
