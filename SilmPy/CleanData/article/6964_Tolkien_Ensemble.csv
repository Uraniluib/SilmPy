The '''Tolkien Ensemble''' (founded in 1995) is a Danish ensemble with the aim to create "the world's first complete musical interpretation of the poems and songs from [[The Lord of the Rings]]". They published four CDs from 1997 to 2005. The project was given approval by both the [[Tolkien Estate|Tolkien family]] and [[Harper Collins]] Publishers. Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] gave permission to use her illustrations in the CD layout.

Permanent members were [[Caspar Reiff]] and Peter Hall (composition), Signe Asmussen (singing) and  Morten Ryelund Sørensen (conductor).
