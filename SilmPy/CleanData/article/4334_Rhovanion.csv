{{pronounce|Sindarin - Rhovanion.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
'''Rhovanion''' or '''Wilderland''' was a large region of northern [[Middle-earth]]. The Great River [[Anduin]] flowed through it, and the immense forest of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] was a part of it.

Properly speaking Rhovanion was the name of a small region east of Greenwood, which later was the Kingdom of Rhovanion, but the name was used for all of Wilderland by the late [[Third Age]].

Many wild horses and wild kine roamed the plains of Rhovanion.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=5 August 2018}}</ref>

==History==
=== First Age ===
In the [[First Age]] the [[Elves]] passed through it during the [[Great Journey]], and much later the [[Atanatári]] (Fathers of [[Men]]) followed them. It is not otherwise mentioned until the [[Second Age]].
=== Second Age ===
Rhovanion played host to two [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] Elf kingdoms ruled by [[Sindar]]in lords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (or [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]).

The great battlefield (or [[Dagorlad]]) of the [[War of the Last Alliance]] against the host of [[Sauron]] lay in the south of Rhovanion, and in the [[Gladden Fields]] of the Great River the High King of Gondor and [[Arnor]], [[Isildur]], son of [[Elendil]], was killed.

=== Third Age ===
In the early Third Age, it was a quite populated area: in the north lay the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Dwarf halls in the Ered Mithrin, and the Mannish kingdom of [[Dale]], in the north of the Great River [[Anduin]] lay the Mannish realm of [[Éothéod]], and in and around the south and east of Greenwood the Great lived the Men of Rhovanion.

In {{TA|1248}} [[Rómendacil II]], who as Minalcar served as Regent to his uncle of [[Atanatar II]] of Gondor, destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged. The King of Rhovanion at this time was [[Vidugavia]] - ruling the lands between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]]<ref name="AppGondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> - and Prince [[Valacar]] of Gondor served in his army and integrated with their culture. Vidugavia's daughter [[Vidumavi]] married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] in {{TA|1432|n}}, which led to the [[Kin-strife]] in {{TA|1437|n}}. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in {{TA|1447|n}}.

In the north of Greenwood lived the Silvan elves ruled by [[Thranduil]], and in the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled [[Amdír]] and later [[Amroth]]. In the far south, near the great falls of [[Sarn Gebir]], watched the northern guard of [[Gondor]], and in the valleys of the Anduin lived [[Stoors]] ([[Hobbits|Hobbit]]s).

In {{TA|1636|n}} the [[Great Plague]] devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half its people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in {{TA|1851|n}} the [[Wainriders]] overran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but in {{TA|1899|n}} Rhovanion revolted, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from the west. Rhovanion was freed but left extremely weakened. Many Men of Rhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant relatives.

In circa {{TA|2460|n}} [[Sauron]] returned as the Necromancer he took residence at [[Dol Guldur]] in the south of Greenwood. And Greenwood became evil and was renamed Mirkwood. The Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale were destroyed and scattered when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] took Erebor, and Gondor retreated from the Falls. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably the [[Beornings]] and the Men of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] upon the [[Long Lake]]. The Men of Éothéod removed south at the invite of Gondor and settled the plains of [[Calenardhon]], later [[Rohan]]. After being driven out of Erebor the Dwarves relocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the [[Ered Luin]] in [[Eriador]].

At the end of the Third Age, the Kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were restored as a result of the death of Smaug and the [[Battle of Five Armies]], and Sauron was removed from Mirkwood by the wizard [[Gandalf]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] it held off an invasion by Sauron's forces, and after Sauron was defeated Mirkwood was clean again, and renamed ''Eryn Lasgalen'', or "Wood of Greenleaves". Some time during the [[Fourth Age]] Gondor claimed large parts of it.

==Boundaries==

*To the east: the [[River Running]] and the inland [[Sea of Rhûn]].
*To the north: the [[Grey Mountains]] and [[Iron Hills]], home of the Dwarves.
*To the west: the range of the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], or Misty Mountains.
*To the south: the line marked by the [[Limlight]] river, Anduin, [[Emyn Muil]], [[Dagorlad]], and the [[Ered Lithui]].

Important rivers were the [[Anduin]] or Great River, the [[River Running|Celduin]] or Running, and the [[Carnen]] or Redwater.

Major features were the forest of [[Mirkwood]], and the [[Long Lake]] of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].

==Etymology==
''Rhovanion'' is [[Sindarin]]<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 78</ref> for "wilderland" and contains ''[[rhovan]]'', with the place-name ending ''[[-ion]]''.

''Wilderland'' was a [[Hobbitish|Hobbit]] name.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 14</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] made ''Wilderland'' based on ''wilderness'' but with a side-reference to the verbs ''wilder'', "wander astray" and ''bewilder''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 779</ref>
