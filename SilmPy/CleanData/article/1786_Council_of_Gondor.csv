The '''Council of Gondor''' was composed of captains that provided advice to the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] and later the [[Stewards of Gondor]].  
==History==
It was traditional among the [[Númenóreans|Men of Númenor]] for the King to maintain a [[Council of the Sceptre]] composed of nobles from each of the main regions of [[Númenor]], together with the King's Heir as advisers.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 23</ref>

Their descendants in Gondor followed a similar system made up from representatives of each of the South-kingdom's separate lands, probably in addition to the King's heir, and apparently the Steward as well.

The Council took authority over the realm after the loss of [[Ondoher]] left it kingless in {{TA|1944}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and it acted under the control of Steward [[Pelendur]]. In {{TA|1945}} [[Arvedui]] of [[Arthedain]], whose wife was [[Fíriel|Ondoher's daughter]], invoked the [[Law of Succession in Númenor]] to claim the throne of Gondor; the Council voted against his claim, in favour of Ondoher's distant relative, [[Eärnil II]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  

As the [[Siege of Gondor]] approached, [[Denethor|Denethor II]] called the Council together on [[11 March]], {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and it advised him to make no stroke of war against the enemy due to the threat from the south.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>
