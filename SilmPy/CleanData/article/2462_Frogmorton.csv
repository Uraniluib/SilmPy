'''Frogmorton''' was a village in the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]]. It stood on the [[East Road]], between the [[Three-Farthing Stone]] (fourteen miles to the west) and the [[Brandywine Bridge]] (twenty-two miles to the east). Immediately to the north of the village, the stream known as [[The Water]] broke into two, creating a wide watery region.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

Until the [[War of the Ring]], the village seems to have been most notable for its inn, [[The Floating Log]]. During the brief time when [[Saruman]] took over the Shire, though, it became the home of the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]] of Shirriffs, and it was here that the returning [[Travellers]] were "arrested" and brought to the [[Shirriff-house]] of the village on their journey back to [[Hobbiton]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is analysed as ''frog'' + ''moor'' ("marshy land") and ''ton'' ("town, village")<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref> obviously referring to a marshy land at the division of [[The Water]]. Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested a speculative [[Old English]] etymology from *''Froggameretun'' meaning "town by the frog-pool".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
