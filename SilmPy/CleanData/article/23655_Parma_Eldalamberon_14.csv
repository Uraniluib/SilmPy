== From the publisher ==

''Parma Eldalamberon'' 'The Book of Elven-tongues', edited by Christopher Gilson, is a journal of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship, a special interest group of the Mythopoeic Society.  

The current issue has three sections containing newly published writings by J. R. R. Tolkien: "Early Qenya Fragments", edited by Patrick Wynne and Christopher Gilson; "Early Qenya Grammar", edited by Carl F. Hostetter and Bill Welden; and "The Valmaric Script", edited by Arden R. Smith. Each of these has been prepared with the guidance of Christopher Tolkien and with the permission of the Tolkien Estate.

"Early Qenya Fragments" is a collection of Tolkien's tables and name-lists associated with ''The Book of Lost Tales'', including early names of the Days of the Elvish Week and the Valinorian Fortnight, and names of the Valar and various Creatures of the Earth, as Tolkien conceived of them in his earliest mythology. Also included are paradigms of the Regular Qenya Verb conjugation associated with the ''Qenya Lexicon''.

"Early Qenya Grammar" includes early writings on Qenya Phonology, together with the earliest complete Qenya Grammar, describing the forms and inflections of the Article, Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Numbers, Pronouns, and Verbs.  Both of these texts date from the 1920s. Annotations and commentary are provided for all of the Early Qenya texts, detailing their interconnections and the evolution of the linguistic conceptions contained within them.

"The Valmaric Script" is an edition of various documents relating to an Elvish writing system devised by Tolkien in the 1920s. One example of the script has been published already in a drawing for the story ''Roverandom''. This edition incudes various charts of the sounds represented by the letters, tracing Tolkien's experimentation with their forms and applications.  There are also examples of the Valmaric script used for writing both Qenya and English, including an excerpt from the Old English poem ''Beowulf''. Transcriptions of these texts and commentary on the chronology of the documents and their conceptual evolution are included in this edition.
