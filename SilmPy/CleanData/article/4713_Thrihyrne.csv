'''Thrihyrne''' refers to the northernmost three steep-sided peaks of the [[White Mountains]], which also marked the southern edge of the wide [[Gap of Rohan]]. 

They stood out above the gorge of [[Helm's Deep]], which wound into them, and could be seen behind the [[Hornburg]], built on an outlying northern spur known as the [[Hornrock]].<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>
