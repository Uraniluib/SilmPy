==Transcription==
{{blockquote|Dear Unwin,<br/><br/>It was most kind of you to send me a copy of Richard Hughes' remarks. It has done much to lighten the despondency into which I have fallen. 1953 and 54 have been specially unkind to me in providing every kind of obstacle to my giving proper attention to the ''Lord of the Rings''.<br/><br/>It should be an honour and advantage to be reviewed by Hughes, and I hope he will manage it.<br/><br/>With best wishes,<br/><br/>Yours sincerely<br/><br/>Ronald Tolkien.}}
