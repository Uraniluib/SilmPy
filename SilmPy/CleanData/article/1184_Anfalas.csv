'''Anfalas''', or '''Langstrand''', was a coastal region of [[Gondor]] between the rivers [[Lefnui]] and [[Morthond]], south of [[Pinnath Gelin]].

==History==
In the [[Third Age]] the [[Gondorians|Men of Gondor]] had traditions that it was once inhabited by [[Elves]].<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], the people of the Anfalas were harassed at the coasts by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. Lord [[Golasgil]] led a long line of scantily equipped hunters and fishermen, and also his own household, to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Anfalas'' means "Long Shore/Beach" in [[Sindarin]] (''[[and]] + [[falas]]''). It is also translated as '''''Andafalasse''''' in [[Quenya]] and '''''Langstrand''''' in [[Westron]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 135</ref><ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 15</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the shortening of ''long'' to ''lang'' is very frequent in English place-names.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 773</ref>
