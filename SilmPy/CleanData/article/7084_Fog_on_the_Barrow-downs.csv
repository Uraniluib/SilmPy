'''Fog on the Barrow-downs''' is the eighth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
The next morning the [[Hobbits]] set out and arrived at the edge of the [[Barrow-downs]] by evening. They got lost and are captured by the [[Barrow-wights]]. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] [[Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!‎|called]] for [[Tom Bombadil]] using a song they had been taught; Tom rescued them. Tom sang them to consciousness and brought back their ponies, which had strayed. He gave them each a sword from the Barrow-wights' stolen treasure. The swords had been forged by the [[Númenóreans|Men of Westernesse]], foes of the [[Dark Lord]]. Tom saw the Hobbits off and they set out towards [[Bree]]. Frodo reminded the others that he was now traveling under the name of [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] instead of [[Baggins Family|Baggins]].
