'''Mallor''' ({{TA|895}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1110|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 215) was the third [[King of Arthedain]].

==History==
Mallor was the son of [[Beleg (King of Arthedain)|Beleg]] and grandson of [[Amlaith]] of [[Fornost]], the founder of [[Arthedain]]. He became king at the age of 134 when his father died in {{TA|1029}},<ref name="North"/> and ruled during troubled times. 

Mallor's reign coincided with other events that would have a huge impact on [[Middle-earth]]'s history, but whose importance weren't fully recognized at the time, such as the formation of the [[White Council]], and the return of [[Sauron]] as a mysterious shadow that fell over [[Mirkwood]]. It was also the arrival ({{TA|1050}}) from across the [[Misty Mountains]] of a strange race of beings: similar to Men, but far shorter and with hairy, bootless feet. The [[DÃºnedain]] called them ''[[periannath]]'', "halflings", and they were the first [[Hobbits]] to enter [[Eriador]], who would later settle the lands of former [[Arnor]] and Arthedain.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Mallor ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Celepharn]], upon his death in {{TA|1110|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
The etymology of Mallor's name is hard to work out, although, it is likely that at least part of relates to the [[Sindarin]] word ''mall-'' meaning "gold".
