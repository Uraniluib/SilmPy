{{disambig-two|an individual of the [[Turtle-fish]]|[[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|poem]]|[[Fastitocalon (poem)]]}}
'''Fastitocalon''' was a legendary sea monster, apparently the last of the mighty [[Turtle-fish]]. He is only mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse.<ref name=Fasti>{{AB|Fastitocalon}}</ref>

Fastitocalon was the size of a small island and vegetation would often grow on his back when not submerged, adding to his deceitful appearance as an actual island. Because of his huge size, sailors landed on his back only to drown when he dove underwater.<ref name=Fasti/>

==Etymology==

''Fastitocalon'' derives from the word ''astitocalon'' of the Shire-speech (rendered in English), which itself is an alteration or corruption of the [[Elvish|High-Elven]] ''Aspido-chel≈çne'' (rendered in Greek, meaning 'turtle with a round shield (of hide)). And "''the F was put on by the versifier simply to make the name alliterate''."<ref name=>{{L|255}}; see also "[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]]" (letter)</ref>
