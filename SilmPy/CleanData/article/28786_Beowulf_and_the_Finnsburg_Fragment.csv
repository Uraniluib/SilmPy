'''''Beowulf and the Finnsburg Fragment''''' (later impressions have ''Finnesburg'') is a Modern English edition of the [[Old English]] poems ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'' and the ''[[Wikipedia:Finnesburg Fragment|Finnesburg Fragment]]''. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] contributed with the section "Prefatory Remarks on Prose Translation of 'Beowulf'" (pp. vii-xli).

The first edition of the translation was published in [[1911]]. Later printings counted the 1940 edition as the second impression. Wrenn and Tolkien's contributions were not included until [[1940]].

Tolkien's essay was reprinted in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays]]'' as "On Translating Beowulf".<ref>''An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography'', at Tolkienbooks.net</ref>
