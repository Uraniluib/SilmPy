'''Guilin''' was an [[Elves|Elf]], probably [[Noldor|Noldo]], of [[Nargothrond]]. He was the father of two sons, [[Gwindor]] and [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]. 

==History==
He was an Elf of [[Valinor]] who lived in Nargothrond during the late [[First Age]]. After Gwindor his son and [[Túrin]] returned to Nargothrond, the folk of that city held a great feast to commemorate Gwindor's return. During that feast he haled Túrin with a cup made in Valinor during the days of the glory of the Noldor. Afterwards he accepted them both into his own home.<ref>{{LB|1d}}</ref>

His sons played a great role on the history of the [[Elves]] in the late [[First Age]]. It was Gwindor's desperation over the torture of his brother that triggered the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> and long after that dreadful battle he led Túrin back to Nargothrond, starting a chain of events that would lead to its destruction.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
