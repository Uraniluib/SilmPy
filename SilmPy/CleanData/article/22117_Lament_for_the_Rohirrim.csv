==History==
On their way to [[Edoras]], [[Aragorn]] spoke an ancient rhyme to characterize the [[Rohirrim]]. The poem was written long ago by a forgotten poet.<ref>{{HM|TT}}, "[[The King of the Golden Hall]]"</ref>

==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;"> 
Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? 
Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? 
Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? 
Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? 
They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow; 
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow. 
Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, 
Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning? 
</poem>

:At the beginning of the Battle of Helm's Deep, [[Th√©oden]] recites some lines of the song, lamenting how alone the Rohirrim stand. <blockquote>Where is the horse and the rider?<br/>Where is the horn that was blowing?<br/>They have passed like rain on the mountains,<br/>like wind in the meadow.<br/>The days have gone down in the West,<br/>behind the hills... into Shadow.</blockquote>
