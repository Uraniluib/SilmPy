'''Barad Nimras''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] 'Tower of the White Horn'<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>) was a tower on a headland westward of [[Eglarest]]<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> built by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. Its purpose was to watch the western seas, and warn of any naval attack by [[Morgoth]]'s forces. As Morgoth never mounted any attack from the ocean, the tower was never in fact needed.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

In the year after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], though, Morgoth did launch [[Fall of the Falas|a land-based attack]] on [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], and Barad Nimras was torn down at that time by the very foes it was meant to guard against.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
==Etymology==
''Barad Nimras'' is a [[Sindarin]] name from ''[[barad]]'' "tower", ''[[nimp]]'' "white" and ''[[ras]]'' "horn". It may be a reference to the tower itself, or perhaps to the narrow cape on which it stood.
