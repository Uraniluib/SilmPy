'''The Dragon's Visit''' is a humorous poem about a [[Dragons|dragon]], written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (probably in [[1928]]) in his series ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]''. When submitting a number of poems for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book]]'' in [[1962]], "The Dragon's Visit" was included but was eventually omitted from the collection.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 214</ref> [[Douglas A. Anderson]] has suggested that Tolkien perhaps thought the poem unsuitable within the [[legendarium]].<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 309-11</ref>
==Publication history==
The poem was first published on [[4 February|February 4]]th, [[1937]] within ''The Oxford Magazine'' (Volume 55, Number 11). A revised version of the poem, with a different ending, was printed in ''[[Winter's Tales for Children 1]]'' (October [[1965]]) and in ''[[The Young Magicians]]'' ([[1969]]). The original poem (together with the revised ending) was included in [[Douglas A. Anderson]]'s ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' in [[1988]] and in ''[[Tales Before Narnia]]'' in [[2008]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D.
