The '''house of Tulkas''' was the dwelling of [[Tulkas]] in [[Valmar]], the city of the [[Valar]] in [[Valinor]].<ref group=note>The notion of Tulkas having a house in Valmar only appears in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]], where [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] often included more elaborate descriptions of the Valar than in his manuscripts of later years.</ref>

The house is said to have sprung "''high into the air with many storeys''", and to sport a "''tower of bronze and pillars of copper in a wide arcade''". Tulkas's house also had a court, where champions engaged in athletic games. There would often [[Nessa]], wife of Tulkas, appear to bring goblets of wine and drinks to the players.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 75</ref>
