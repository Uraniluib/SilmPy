The '''Three Rings''' were magical artifacts, three of the [[Rings of Power]]. They were forged by Celebrimbor and his smiths with the desire of "understanding, making, and healing" and granted the power to preserve all things unstained.<ref name=l144>{{L|144}}</ref><ref name=council>{{FR|Council}}</ref> They were named '''[[Vilya]]''', '''[[Narya]]''', and '''[[Nenya]]''' after the principal elements of air, fire, and water (respectively). 

Whereas the other [[Rings of Power]] gave the power to control and conquer, and [[Wraith-world|made their wearers invisible]], the Three were different. [[Sauron]] did not assist in their making nor ever did he touch them, and his taint was not directly upon them.<ref name=l131>{{L|131}}</ref> But, as they were created according to the craft taught by him, they would fall under the power of [[the One Ring]].<ref name=rings/>

==Names and descriptions of the Three Rings==

* [[Nenya]], The Ring of Water, also called the Ring of Adamant, made of ''[[mithril]]'' with a shimmering white stone; it was the chief of the Three<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 251</ref> originally worn by [[Celebrimbor]] himself but given to [[Galadriel]]
* [[Narya]], The Ring of Fire, set with a ruby; originally worn by [[Gil-galad]], then by [[Círdan]], who finally gave it to [[Gandalf]].
* [[Vilya]], The Ring of Air and mightiest of the Three, gold with a sapphire stone; originally worn by [[Gil-galad]] but given to [[Elrond]].

The Rings were named after the three principal elements, each matching the color of their stones. Their names also match the fates of the three [[Silmarils]].<ref group=note>[[Maglor]] threw one into the sea, [[Maedhros]] fell with one in the lava, while [[Earendil]] keeps one in the sky.</ref><ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Stan Brown|articleurl=http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q3-Names What were the names of the Three Rings, and what were they made of?|website=[http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm FAQ of the Rings]}}</ref> However not much is known about their specific powers and whether they had anything to do with each element.<ref>{{webcite|author=Stan Brown|articleurl=http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm#Q3-Powers What special powers did the Three Rings have?|website=[http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm FAQ of the Rings]}}</ref>

==History==
After "[[Annatar]]" taught and assisted the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] with creating the [[Rings of Power]], he left [[Eregion]]. Celebrimbor's smiths proceeded then to forge Three more on their own with the knowledge already gained from him. Their forging was completed by around {{SA|1590}}.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> Annatar didn't learn about them, and they were "unsullied", free from Sauron's corrupting influence.

When Sauron created the One Ring, the Elves who wore the Rings of Power heard his voice and realized they had been deceived.<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> Celebrimbor then sent his three rings away for safekeeping: He gave Nenya to [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]], who advised him to send the other two west away from Sauron, so he gave Vilya and Narya to [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]].

As the Elves failed him, Sauron [[War of the Elves and Sauron|waged war]] against Eregion and succeeded in claiming the Rings of Power. But the Three remained outside his grasp and their whereabouts were seldom revealed. 

After Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], the [[Keepers of the Three Rings]] were free to wear them. During the [[Third Age]], the Rings were not idle.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, Elrond's words to Gloin</ref> They were used to create enclaves of peace and protection where memory and beauty were preserved from wear and decay.<ref name=rings/><ref name=l131/> 

During the [[War of the Ring]] [[Frodo Baggins]] found out that Galadriel held Nenya, using it to preserve [[Lothlórien]] from withering, and [[Aragorn]] reprimanded him for revealing this. The other two rings were revealed at the end of the Third Age, after Frodo destroyed [[the One Ring]], and the Dark Lord Sauron was completely overthrown. It transpired that [[Elrond]] had wielded [[Vilya]] and presumably used its powers to keep [[Rivendell]] a haven safe from attack. It was [[Gandalf]] who wielded [[Narya]], given to him by [[Círdan]].<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, p.389</ref> 

After the destruction of the One Ring, their power diminished and became plain relics. Not being able to hold back Time and preserve the High-elven lore and beauty, their bearers, in the [[Last Riding of the Keepers]], left [[Middle-earth]] on the [[White Ship]].<ref name=l144/><ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> The [[Third Age]] ended and the [[Dominion of Men]] began.
