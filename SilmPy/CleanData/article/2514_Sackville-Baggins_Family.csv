<noinclude>The '''Sackville-Baggins Family''' was a branch of the [[Baggins Family]].

==History==
[[Camellia Sackville]] was the daughter of the head of the [[Sackville Family]].<ref name="L214">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 214]] (late [[1958]], early [[1959]])</ref> She married [[Longo Baggins]], the son of [[Mungo Baggins]].<ref name="Bag"/> Some time prior to the birth of their first son, [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]], Camelia's father died. As was the custom in the "younger" families when there was no male heir, the headship passed to the daughter's eldest son. He would then use his mother's name, and add his father's to it. Thus, the Sackville-Baggins branch was created.<ref name="L214"/>

Otho married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] of [[Hardbottle]], and the two had one child, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].<ref name="Bag"/> Despite being the heir of the wealthy<ref>[[J.R.R.

==Genealogy==
<noinclude>The Sackville-Bagginses were descendants of Mungo Baggins, like Bilbo. They considered themselves the heir of the Baggins Family headship because Frodo Baggins was the descendant of [[Largo Baggins]], Mungo's younger brother.</noinclude><includeonly>The Sackville-Baggins family tree.</includeonly><ref name="Bag">{{App|C1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''Sackville''' was the name of a relatively young Hobbit family.<ref name="L214"/> Their name had an association with '''Baggins''' in that both contained an element for "bag/sack"; Sackville was a slightly more aristocratic version.<ref name="Nomen">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (eds.), ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', published in: [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 762</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] argued that this "similarity" also provoked an antonymy: [[Bag End]] was used around England as a replacement of French ''cul-de-sac'', "dead end street" - even Tolkien's own aunt [[Jane Neave]] lived in a house of that name. Tolkien did not like the Norman conquest of Britain, and made the Bagginses English. The name ''Sackville'', however, is very Norman, as one of the few, if not the only, Hobbit family name.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century]]'', page 10</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Sackville-Baggins were called the '''Allibone Baggins'''.<ref>{{HH|End}}, p. 691</ref>  [[John D. Rateliff]] stated that the change to "Sackville" was penciled in about the time the story was being prepared for publication in [[1936]].  The significance of "Allibone" is unknown although Mr. Rateliff thought it might relate to ''Alboin'', a character in ''The Lost Road''.<ref>{{HH|End}}, Text Note 14, p. 699</ref>
