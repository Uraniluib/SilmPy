The '''Northmen''' were [[Men]] that lived in the north of  [[Rhovanion]] in [[Middle-earth]], and were friendly to [[Gondor]].

The Northmen who dwelt in [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and other parts of  [[Rhovanion]] were friendly to the [[Dúnedain]] and were after the Dúnedain the most noble Men on [[Arda]], counted as [[Middle Men]] by the Dúnedain, and believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as the [[Edain]], the [[Atanatári]]. The only difference was that they didn't cross the [[Ered Luin]] into [[Beleriand]] and therefore didn't go to [[Númenor]]. The result of them not participating in the War against [[Morgoth]] was their considerably shorter lifespan if compared to the lifespan of the Dúnedain, whose lifespan was enhanced by the [[Valar]] after the [[War of Wrath]]. 

The [[Men of Dale]] and [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] were also counted under the Northmen, as were the [[Woodmen|woodsmen of Mirkwood]]. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated after the wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague.
==History==
===Origins===
{{seealso|Middle Men}}
The Northmen descended from the group of the [[Edain]] who left their kin to reach the West, being always at war with the [[Men of Darkness]].<ref name="DM">{{PM|X}}</ref> The "Bëorians" were on the vanguard and the "Hadorians" followed on their trail. The latter who were divided while passing through [[Greenwood]]: some reached the [[Vales of Anduin]] and turned northwards, while others passed between the northernmost eaves of the Wood and the [[Ered Mithrin]]. Only a few of them reached [[Eriador]] and then [[Beleriand]].<ref name=relations/> As such, the Northmern appear to be akin to the House of Hador who stayed behind in Rhovanion.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|8}}</ref><ref name=relations/> 

Already in the [[First Age]] those Men of Rhovanion settled near the lands of the [[Longbeards]] and they began dealing with them establishing an economy in which Men chiefly provided food in exchange for Dwarven work in building, road-construction, mining, and the crafting of tools and weapons. The Men looked at the Dwarves with awe (although it is said that they had met evil ones in the east<ref>{{PM|XNotes}} #28</ref> and were eager to learn from them. This system benefitted mostly the Dwarves, as the services they provided to Men required less effort than those offered in exchange.<ref name=relations>{{PM|relations}}</ref>

Those centuries many Men wandered or settled the empty lands between the [[Iron Hill]], the [[Greenwood]] and the [[Inland Sea]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

===Second Age===
By the Second Age the Men who settled between the [[Grey Mountains]] and [[Mirkwood]] became numerous (compared to the Dwarves) but where scattered in villages. After the [[War of Wrath]], former [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]], now leaderless and reckless, but still numerous, armed and cruel, returned to the East and started harassing the lands again. Those of the Men who settled small towns, could defend themselves only with [[bows]], fences and dikes. Once more, the Dwarves provided the Men with metal weapons and defensive measures in exchange for their skill in taming and riding horses, consisting them scouts and mounted archers. Thus the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] was formed, resulting to mutual respect and aso warm friendship.<ref name=relations /> During this period the Longbeards adopted the [[Northern Mannish|speech]] of Men, keeping their own language to themselves.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref name=relations />

The Alliance ended in the [[Dark Years]] when [[Sauron]] sent Orcs to invade the peoples. The Northmen had war also with savage tribes of [[Easterlings]]. The war scattered them and the diminished numbers who remained there were impoverished, living in caves or in the borders of [[Greenwood]].<ref name=relations />

[[Rhovanion]] fell under the dominion of [[Sauron]] before being liberated by [[Gil-galad]].

===Third Age===
The [[Kings of Gondor]] recognised the common ancenstry with the Men of Rhovanion and showed them great favor. For a time many of them even became subjects of Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river [[Anduin]]. They were given wide lands south of [[Greenwood the Great]] to serve as a buffer against the [[Easterlings]] around {{TA|1000}}<ref name=Foster>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 293-4</ref>. They increased greatly during Gondor's golden age.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  East of Greenwood the Great was the "kingdom of Rhovanion", and this became the most important nation of the Northmen. 

However some Northmen were hostile to [[Gondor]] and often assailed the kingdom for a long time.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref> In the days of [[Narmacil I]], some Northmern joined the Easterlings who resumed their attacks, either because of feuds, or because of greed for spoil, as [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]] [[Minalcar]] found out. In the fourteenth century of the [[Third Age]], Minalcar, now as King of Gondor ensured their loyalty by crushing the Easterlings in {{TA|1248}} with the help of Prince [[Vidugavia]], and took many Northmen as officers in the army of Gondor (although the high men of Gondor looked askance at them)<ref name=Foster/><ref name=gondor/>. He sent his son [[Valacar]] as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called "King of Rhovanion". Valacar married the daughter of the King, [[Vidumavi]], and their son, ''[[Vinitharya]]'' (in her mother tongue) succeeded him as King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]]. His mixed ancestry caused a civil war, the [[Kin-strife]] in {{TA|1447}}.

Their existence was a bulwark of [[Gondor]], keeping its northern and eastern frontiers from invasion. They were weakened with the [[Great Plague]], which appeared there in the winter of {{TA|1635}} and soon spread to Gondor. The Horsemen suffered because it came with a cold winter and they had only low wooden houses and thronged stables, being little skilled in the arts of healing and medicine. When the Plague passed more than half of the foil of Rhovanion had perished, and of their horses also. They were slow to recover, but they were undisturbed, since the hostile Easterlings had been equally afflicted.<ref name="Cirion"/>

When the invasions of the [[Wainriders]] began against Gondor, the Northmen suffered the first assaults. Their scattered remains were recruited by King [[Narmacil II]] who took a great army north into the plains south of Mirkwood. They were defeated in the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}) where Narmacil and [[Marhari]] were killed. The remnant of his army retreated over the [[Dagorlad]] into [[Ithilien]]. Most of the Northmen were reduced to servitude, and all their former lands were occupied by the Wainriders. A few managed to flee to Gondor, others over the [[River Running|Celduin]] and were merged with their kin, the folk of [[Dale]] under [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and others followed [[Marhwini]] to the [[Vales of Anduin]] and became the ancestors of the [[Éothéod]]. <ref name="Cirion"/>

In {{TA|1899}} Marhwini prepared an outbreak against the Wainrider occupation. After helping [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] in fighting them in [[Dagorlad]], desperate poorly-armed outlaws came out of Mirkwood and roused the slaves. They burned many Wainriders dwellings,  storehouses and fortified camps of wagons. Most of them perished in the attempt fighting the Wainriders' youths, women and old men. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref name="Cirion"/> Afterwards they battled with the enemies alone since Gondor could not help them. Still they joined the forces of Gondor and many comprised the army of the [[Battle of Fornost]] ({{TA|1975}})<ref name=Foster/>.

After the evil Kingdom of [[Angmar]] was defeated by Gondor and the remains of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1977}}, these Northmen moved north and began to call themselves the [[Éothéod]]. They were skilled horsebreeders and horsemen. In {{TA|2510}} they responded to a plea of help from the trapped Gondorian army at the [[Field of Celebrant]]. After they helped Gondor win this important victory they were rewarded the province of [[Calenardhon]] and became known as the [[Rohirrim]]. 

The later centuries it is mentioned that the Northmen were allied with [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and with [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] weapons drove the enemies back to [[Rhûn]]. However they did not prevent the enemies to reach the gates of Erebor during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=Foster/>

In the [[Fourth Age]], they obviously retained their alliance with the [[Reunited Kingdom]].<ref name=Foster/>

==Inspiration==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was possibly inspired by the ancient [[Wikipedia:Norsemen|Northmen]] of northern Europe, the speakers of [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]]. These "Northmen" appear in his poem "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]".<ref>{{HB|II}}</ref>
