'''Nen Lalaith''' was a babbling stream that rose under the mountain of [[Amon Darthir]] in the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]], and flowed north-westwards out onto the shaded plains of [[Dor-lómin]].<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref> There, it trickled past the house of [[Húrin]], and was said to have given its name to his ill-fated young daughter, [[Lalaith]].<ref>{{CH|1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Nen Lalaith means "Water of Laughter" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[nen]]'' = "river, water" and ''[[Lalaith (word)|lalaith]]'' = "laughter").
