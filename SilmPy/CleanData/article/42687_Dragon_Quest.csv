'''''Dragon Quest''''' is an album by [[Soundestiny]] that was released in 2012.
 
All words and music were written by Darryl Grant Potter. This CD is a 12-song album that contains music inspired by [[The Hobbit]]. The songs themselves contain no references to any [[Middle-earth]] characters such as [[Frodo]] or [[Gandalf]], nor place-names like [[Mordor]] or [[Gondor]]. Previously (2009),[[Soundestiny]] released 4 of these tracks on an EP [[All that Glitters]]. This 2012 album contains a further 8 songs that complete their homage to [[The Hobbit]]. The 3-year gap between these releases occurred because the band released their 2nd LOTR-inspired album [[Winds of Change]] in 2010.
