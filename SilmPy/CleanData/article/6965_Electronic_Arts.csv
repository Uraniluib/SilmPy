'''Electronic Arts''' or '''EA''' for short is an American video games developing, publishing and distributing company, founded in [[1982]]. Among its successes are ''The Sims'', James Bond and various sports games, published by daughter company EA Sports. 

==History==
===Early efforts===
Electronic Arts had it first fantasy game with ''[[wikipedia:Bard's_Tale_(1985)|The Bard's Tale]]'' in [[1985]], and was introduced to the world of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in [[1990]], when they held the UK distribution of [[Interplay Productions|Interplay]]'s ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 video game)|The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]]''.<ref>[http://www.lysator.liu.se/tolkien-games/entry/lotr1.html J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I] at Tolkien Games (retrieved 18 March 2011)</ref> In 1994 they published [[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (SNES)|The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]] for the [[wikipedia:Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]].<ref>[http://www.lysator.liu.se/tolkien-games/entry/lotr1-nintendo.html J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I] at Tolkien Games (retrieved 18 March 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/jrr-tolkiens-lord-of-the-rings-volume-one J.R.R.

===Movie license===
Electronic Arts purchased the interactive entertainment rights of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] in [[2002]]. That was after the video game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' by [[Vivendi]] came out, leading several people to believe that was an Electronic Arts game too. EA had to compress both the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|first]] and the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|second]] film into one game, which became ''[[EA's The Two Towers|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' in [[2002]]. A year later, a game based on the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third]] film was also made, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. When all movie-based games were published, an "alternative [[Fellowship of the Ring|fellowship]]"- game, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'', was made. Because it did not have rights to the book, it had to fill in the gameplay with movie-like aspects. 

===Book license=== 
In [[2005]], a license to the books could be purchased from [[Saul Zaentz]], which led the way to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' and an expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. The popularity of these games made Electronic Arts to extend their license until [[2008]].<ref>http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13313</ref> One more title was planned; at first, this would have been ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The White Council]]'', but that has been cancelled. ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' was published in January [[2009]].

==Jackson==
Despite borrowing music, character design and character voices from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], Electronic Arts did not leave room for [[Peter Jackson]]'s input. This did not sit well with Jackson, who turned to [[wikipedia:Ubisoft|Ubisoft]] for the film tie-in game of ''[[wikipedia:King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/24/technology/24kong.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all</ref>
