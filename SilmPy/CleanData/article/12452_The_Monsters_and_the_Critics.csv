'''''The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays''''' is a collection of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s scholarly linguistic essays and lectures. The book was published posthumously in [[1983]], edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

The book also contains a foreword by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Relation to the Legendarium==

As these essays are of a scholarly nature, there are scarcely any direct references to the [[legendarium]] of Tolkien. However, the essay "A Secret Vice" contains a final section of ''Notes'' by Christopher Tolkien, where he points to references to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and also reprints  a later version of one of the Elvish poems, being "one of the major pieces of [[Quenya]]"<ref>Chistopher Tolkien, "Foreword", p.4.</ref>.

==From the cover/back==

The seven 'essays' by J.R.R. Tolkien assembled in this new paperback edition were with one exception delivered as general lectures on particular occasions; and while they mostly arose out of Tolkien's work in medieval literature, they are accessible to all. Two of them are concerned with ''Beowulf'', including the well-known lecture whose title is taken for this book, and one with ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', given in the University of Glasgow in 1953.

Also included in this volume is the lecture ''English and Welsh''; the ''Valedictory Address to the University of Oxford'' in 1959; and a paper on Invented Languages delivered in 1931, with exemplification from poems in the Elvish tongues. Most famous of all is ''On Fairy-Stories'', a discussion of the nature of fairy-tales and fantasy, which gives insight into Tolkien's approach to the whole genre.

The pieces in this collection cover a period of nearly thirty years, beginning six years before the publication of ''The Hobbit'', with a unique 'academic' lecture on his invention (calling it ''A Secret Vice'') and concluding with his farewell to professorship, five years after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings''.
