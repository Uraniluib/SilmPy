{{merge|Gondorians}}
The '''Dúnedain of the South''' were the descendants of the [[Exiles of Númenor]] who settled in the southern lands of [[Middle-earth]], and founded the southern kingdom of [[Gondor]]. Their first independent King was [[Meneldil]], the nephew of [[Isildur]], whose line ruled over [[Gondor]] for more than two thousand years. Unlike their cousins in the North, the Dúnedain of the South maintained their realm even after the loss of its Kings, and it survived under the rule of the [[Ruling Steward|Stewards]] until the time of the [[War of the Ring]], when the Kingship was restored.
