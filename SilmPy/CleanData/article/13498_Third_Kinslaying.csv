The '''Third Kinslaying''' was the disastrous attack on the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] by the surviving [[Sons of Fëanor]] in the year 538 of the [[First Age]].<ref name="Years">{{WJ|Years}}</ref> 

Fëanor and his Sons had sworn an [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] to acquire the [[Silmarils]] at any cost, so when they learned that [[Elwing]] had one of the Jewels in her possession (the one rescued by [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]), the demanded it back. But the [[Nauglamir]] was a blessed relic for the peoples of the Havens, that were the last holdings of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] in [[Beleriand]].

As a final resort, the Sons of Fëanor sacked the Havens, but Elwing managed to escape with the Silmaril. The Havens were utterly destroyed in what was considered to be the "cruelest of the slayings of Elf by Elf, and... the third of the [[Kinslaying (disambiguation)|great wrongs]] achieved by the accursed oath".<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> The [[Men|Mannish]] poet [[Dírhavel]] was also among those who fell. [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], sons of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], were captured by [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], although later Maglor grew to love them and set them free.
