The '''Second Hall''' was one of many Halls of [[Moria]]. Between the Second and the [[First Hall]] - counting from the [[Great Gates|entrance]] of the city - lay the ill-fated [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] in the [[First Deep]]. 

In {{TA|2994}} [[Orcs]] joined battle with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Balin's Colony]] in the hall. During the [[Battle of the Second Hall|ensuing brawl]] [[Lóni]], [[Náli]] and [[Frár]] were killed while the rest escaped to the [[Seventh Level]], allowing the Orcs to reclaim the Hall.

It was the largest encountered by the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] while they traversed Moria. On their way to the First Hall they met [[Durin's Bane]], and where [[Gandalf]] fell into the chasm.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>
