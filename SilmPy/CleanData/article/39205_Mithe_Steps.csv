'''Mithe Steps''' was a landing-stage at the [[Mithe]], the outflow of the [[Shirebourn]] river. From there a lane ran to [[Deephallow]] and so on to the [[Causeway]] road that went through [[Rushey]] and [[Stock]].<ref>{{ATB|Preface}}</ref> When [[Tom Bombadil]] passed the Mithe, he found Mithe Steps empty and "none was there to greet him".<ref>{{ATB|2}}</ref>
