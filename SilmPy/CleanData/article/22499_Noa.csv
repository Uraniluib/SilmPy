'''''noa''''' is [[Quenya]] word. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] reversed its meaning over the years: (1) one manuscript has "''ekuva nin kare sa noa''", translated as "I 'may' do that tomorrow", where ''noa'' is "tomorrow"; (2) another manuscript gives ''noa'' yesterday, from the expression ''noa rÄ“'' ("former day").<ref name=VT49>{{VT|49a}}, p. 34 (note 23)</ref>

[[Helge Fauskanger]] has suggested that the form ''noa'', analyzed "basically an adjective" (with the meaning "former" or "yesterday") could be valid [[Neo-Quenya]].<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 25 June 2011)</ref>
