'''Eilenach''' was the second of the seven beacon-hills of [[Gondor]], after [[Amon Dîn]] in the east, and it was the highest point of the [[Drúadan Forest]]. It had a sharp summit, incapable of sustaining a large fire. Its main purpose was to relay the fire of Amon Dîn to [[Nardol]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref name=VT42/><ref name=RC/>

On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
On the origin of the name, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote ''Eilenach'' is "probably an alien name, not [[Sindarin]], not [[Númenor|Númenórean]], or [[Westron|Common speech]]."<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 19</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, p. 510</ref> Perhaps it was [[pre-Númenórean]].
