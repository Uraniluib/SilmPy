'''Squirrels''' were nut-eating rodents often found in trees. Most would have been red or grey, but in [[Mirkwood]], the squirrels were black in colour.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>
==Nature of the black squirrels==
During their journey through Mirkwood, [[Thorin|Thorin]] and his company killed a black squirrel for food, but found it to be inedible.<ref>{{H|8}}</ref>

[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that the black squirrels are "''dark in coloration''" (like the other animals the company meet in Mirkwood), "''no doubt from protective camouflage in a dimly lit environment''".<ref>{{HM|MB}}, "VIII. Mirkwood: Text Notes", p. 317</ref>. Henry Gee, discussing the topic of [[Wikipedia:Melanism|melanism]] in [[Middle-earth]], accepts the complexity of the subject (as black creatures often can be said to having been created or used by [[Morgoth]] and [[Sauron]]), but concludes that dark creatures ''per se'' are not "evil" in the works of Tolkien: "''black creatures, whether swans, butterflies or squirrels, are remarkable only inasmuch as there are light-colored forms with which they can be contrasted.''"<ref>Henry Gee, "[http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081104_01.html Melanism in Middle-earth]", as of 21 September 2010</ref>
