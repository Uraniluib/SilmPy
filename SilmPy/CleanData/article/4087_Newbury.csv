'''Newbury''' was a town in the north-eastern [[Buckland]], to the north of [[Crickhollow]] and next to [[High Hay|The Hedge]].<ref name="Shiremap">{{HM|FR}}, "A Part of the Shire" map</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bury'', from the [[Old English]] ''burh'', means "fortified enclosure".<ref name="Nottingham">Nottingham University's Institute for Name-Studies, [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aezins//kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=12884 Bury] (accessed 8 June 2010)</ref> This, combined with Newbury's proximity to The Hedge, perhaps suggests that Newbury was built as a more recent guard against intruders from the [[Old Forest]].
