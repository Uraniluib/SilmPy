'''''ëalar''''' is a [[Quenya]] word which referred to such [[Spirits (creatures)|spirits]] who did not require a body in order to be complete (like the [[Maiar]]). ''Eälar'' are contrasted with ''[[fëar]]'', which are the souls of beings whose natural state is to be incarnated in a body.<ref name=MR>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 165 (commentary on §18)</ref>
==Etymology==
The word is related to Quenya ''ëala'' ("being"),<ref name=MR/> and seems to be related to the Quenya verb ''[[Ea (verb)|ëa]]'' "be, exist". 

It has been suggested that ''-la'' is the present participle ending of verbs (cf. "-ing"; but Quenya ''-la'' only forms adjectival participles)<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/markirya.htm The Markirya Poem]" (accessed 4 March 2011)</ref>
