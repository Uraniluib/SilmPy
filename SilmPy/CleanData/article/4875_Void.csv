'''The Outer Void''', or the '''Timeless Void''', was a term used in various ways.

Cosmologically, it describes the uninhabited regions of (non)existence outside [[Time]] and [[Eä|Creation]], the absence of the [[Flame Imperishable]].

[[Morgoth|Melkor]] used to wander in the Void to look in vain for the Flame Imperishable.

The [[Timeless Halls]] of [[Ilúvatar]] seem to be apart from the Void; [[Eä]] is created amidst the Void but is not a part of it. 

After his defeat in the [[War of Wrath]], [[Morgoth|Melkor]] was cast out into the Timeless Void "through the [[Door of Night]] beyond the [[Walls of the World]]", but legends predict that he will return to the World before its end. The Void thus in that context refers to the vast distant empty spaces of [[Eä]]. This was often confused by [[Elves]] and [[Men]] with the Void that existed before the creation of [[Eä]].<ref>{{MR|P5VII}}</ref>

[[Sauron]]'s spirit also entered the Void after [[The One Ring]] was destroyed.<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

It is also possible [[Gandalf]]'s spirit entered the Void after his battle with the Balrog in Moria, as he "passed out of thought and time."<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

==Names==
The Void was also known as the '''Outer Dark''' (or the Outer Darkness), the '''Everlasting Dark''', the '''Ancient Darkness'''. [[Qenya]] names were ''Avakúma'', ''Oiakúma''<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 8</ref>, and ''[[Kúma]]''.<ref>{{HM|IX}}, p. 31</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 379</ref>
