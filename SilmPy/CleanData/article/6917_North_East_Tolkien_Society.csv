The '''North East Tolkien Society''', formerly known as the New York Tolkien Society, and also known as Heren Istarion, was the largest American [[Smials|Smial]] of [[The Tolkien Society]]. 

==History==
The smial was located on Staten Island, New York. Heren Istarion published its own calendars in 2008,<ref>http://www.tolkiencalendars.com/2008_2009.html(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> 2009,<ref>http://www.tolkiencalendars.com/2008_2009.html(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> 2010<ref>http://www.tolkiencalendars.com/2010.html(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> and 2011.<ref>http://www.tolkiencalendars.com/2011.html(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> No 2012 calendar was printed and sold.

The main force behind Heren Istarion were co-chairs [[Anthony Burdge]] and his wife Jessica Burke. It is defunct since 2009 due to hardship encountered by the co-chairs due to the recession. The last activity of Heren Istarion website was March 2011. The Heren Istarion Facebook page also no longer exists. <ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20090520062052/http://herenistarion.org/(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref><ref>http://www.green-and-growing.com/2011/09/open-letter-to-occupywallstreet.html(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> Consequently it's website<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20051105035454/http://www.herenistarion.org/(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> was downgraded to a blog<ref>http://herenistarionnets.blogspot.com(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref> as well as a Facebook page.<ref>http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=43894627954(accessed 06-12-2011)</ref>

Tolkien related content. <ref>https://plus.google.com/103396983951064584135/posts(accessed 09-10-2012)</ref> In 2013 Anthony Burdge and Jessica Burke founded Myth Ink Books: a fantasy publisher.<ref>http://mythinkbooks.com/about/</ref>

Aside from Heren Istarion New York City has a Meetup.com group: NYC Area Friends of J.R.R. Tolkien & Fantasy, that appears to be active as it meets monthly.
