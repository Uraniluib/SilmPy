'''Alfrid Lickspittle''' was the civil servant of the [[Master of Lake-town]]. His character was invented by [[Peter Jackson]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]], and played by [[Ryan Gage]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150257180211558|articlename=Casting News for The Hobbit|dated=19-May-2011|website=FB|accessed=22-Dec-2011}}</ref>

==History==
Alfrid serves as the [[Master of Lake-town]]'s chief overseer, always alerting the Master of any potential plots against his power - much to the chagrin of some [[Lake-town]] residents. He and the Master particularly have [[Bard]] in their sights, knowing his relation to [[Girion]], last [[Lord of Dale]]. When [[Smaug]] arrives to demolish the town, he and the Master - along with a few guards - empty out the town's treasury into a boat and attempt to retreat with it. However, when the overloaded boat started spilling treasure into the lake, the Master pushes Alfrid overboard in order to lessen the weight.

When the town's refugees gather on the shore of [[Long Lake]] in the aftermath of the destruction, Bard is immediately praised for slaying the [[Dragons|Dragon]] and the citizens look to him for guidance - Alfrid immediately champions Bard despite the disapproval of several people. When the [[Battle of Five Armies]] begins, Alfrid spends most of his time attempting to hide from it, despite Bard ordering every able man to take up arms, and specifically telling Alfrid to join the fighting. Not long after finding a treasure trove in the ruins of [[Dale]], Bard, after saving him from an attack by an [[Ogres|Ogre]], tells him to leave and not come back.

In the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', after said encounter with Bard, Alfrid hides in a catapult, which he inadvertently sets off when one of the coins which he has collected drops on the release trigger. This launches him into the mouth of a [[Trolls|Troll]], which kills them both.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)]]''</ref>
