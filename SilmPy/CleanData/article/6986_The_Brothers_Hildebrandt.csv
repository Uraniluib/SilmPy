'''The Brothers Hildebrandt''' was a duo of fantasy artists consisting of the twin brothers '''Greg Hildebrandt''' (born [[23 January|January 23]], [[1939]]) and '''Tim Hildebrandt''' (January 23, [[1939]] â€“ [[11 June|June 11]], [[2006]]).

The brothers have been recognized artists in the world of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-inspired art. Other art includes the original poster art of ''[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Art_of_the_Brothers_Hildebrandt Star Wars]'' and over a hundred ''[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Hildebrandt_Brothers/Gallery Marvel Masterpieces]'', including ''Swimsuit Specials''. 

Until Tim's death, the twins painted together, or in shifts, dependent of the time they had for a piece of art. After a struggle with diabetes, Tim passed away on [[11 June|June 11]], [[2006]].
__NOTOC__
==The Lord of the Rings==
After seeing [[The J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar 1975|a Tolkien calendar]] with [[Tim Kirk]]'s art, they responded to a call for artists by [[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]]. Their art was well-liked, and they were commissioned to illustrate the [[1976 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1976 Ballantine calendar]]. 

More calendars followed: [[1977 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1977]], [[1978 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1978]] - and they sold a record one million calendars. They moved their scope to other large projects, but kept producing Tolkien artwork. In [[2001]], ''[[Greg and Tim Hildebrandt: The Tolkien Years]]'' was published by Greg's son, Gregory Jr. Following the release of this collection, Ballantine began to reissue their popular Tolkien Calendars starting in [[The Brothers Hildebrandt 2002 Calendar|2002]].
