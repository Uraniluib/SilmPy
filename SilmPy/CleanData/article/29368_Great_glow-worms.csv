'''''Great glow-worms''''' are said to have crept about the grassy borders of [[Olórë Mallë]], the Path of Dreams.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, p. 18</ref> 

As these creatures are mentioned only fleetingly, it is impossible to say if they were related to the great [[Worms]] (wingless [[Dragons]]), or if they were giant versions of regular ''[[glowworms]]''. One can assume that they glowed in the dark (and therefore perhaps were related to, or were another name for, the [[spark-dragons]]).
