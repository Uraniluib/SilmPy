}}'''Dior''' was the son of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], and the heir to the throne of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], [[King of Doriath]]. Dior was one of the [[Half-elven]]. 

==History==
Dior was born on the island of [[Tol Galen]] in [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> When he was 27 he married [[Nimloth of Doriath]],<ref group=note>[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth's]] parentage is uncertain. She may have been the daughter of [[Galathil]] and a descendant of [[Elmo]], the younger brother of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]].</ref> and took her back to live by the [[Lanthir Lamath]] waterfall at the base of the [[Blue Mountains]]. There they had three children: [[Elwing]], [[Eluréd]], and [[Elurín]]. 

After Thingol was slain by the [[Dwarves]] who coveted the [[Nauglamír]], Dior with his father and a host of [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]] journeyed swiftly north to the river [[Ascar]] and fought the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

He then went to [[Menegroth]] attempting to restore the realm of [[Doriath]]. 
After the death of his parents, a Lord of the [[Laiquendi]] came to Doriath bringing the Nauglamir, which was worn by his mother. After mourning, he decided to wear it himself. When he placed the Nauglamir on himself, it sat lightly and he appeared as the fairest of three living races: Maiar, Elven, and Human.  This news came to the [[Sons of Feanor]], who came to Doriath with their servants, consumed by the [[Oath of Feanor]].

Dior managed to kill [[Celegorm]] (who, ironically, was also called ''the Fair''), and [[Caranthir]] and [[Curufin]] were also slain, but the Kingdom of Doriath was destroyed. So Dior and Nimloth were slain, during the [[Second Kinslaying]], along with anyone preventing the Feanorians from gaining the [[Silmaril]]. 

After the attack, the servants of Celegorm left Eluréd and Elurín in the forest to die. Elwing, however, carrying the Nauglamir, escaped with the remnant of the [[Iathrim|Elves of Doriath]] to the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> Years later she would wed [[Eärendil]] and together they would seek aid from [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>
