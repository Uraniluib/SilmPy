*'''Contents:''' Fairburn had sent illustrations of [[Middle-earth]] to Tolkien, who replies saying that he considers them to be "''splendid. They are better pictures in themselves and also show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me''". Fairburn's illustrations included a pen-and-ink illustration of [[Gandalf]] on the tower of [[Orthanc]], and "''a little sketch of [[Gollum]]''", and Tolkien continues: "''After seeing your specimens I am beginning to [...] think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing''". Tolkien ends the letter by telling Fairburn that he would be "''very pleased indeed''" to see her other pictures when they are finished.

*'''Description:''' Typewritten letter.
