==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|This is the first descriptive bibliography of J.R.R. Tolkien, one of the most popular writers of the 20th century. His children's book THE HOBBIT, his epic THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and his last triumph, THE SILMARILLION, have been read by millions and are at the core of modern fantasy fiction. A noted philologist, Tolkien also made significant contributions to Old and Middle English studies, including a landmark essay on BEOWULF and standard editions of ANCRENE WISSE and SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT. This bibliography explores the full range of his imaginative and scholarly works, from juvenilia to the posthumous THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH. Books written by Tolkien in whole or in part, his Contributions to Periodicals, Published Letters and Art Work, Interviews, Recordings, and translations of his writings are described. Special attention is paid to THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, whose many editions and complex textual changes are analyzed in detail. The publishing history of Tolkien's works is told at length, with notes drawn from publishers' archives and from Tolkien's correspondence. There are eight pages of plates, a chronology and an index. This bibliography will become a standard reference book for scholars, librarians, booksellers and collectors whose already keen interest in Tolkien continues to grow.}}
