'''Simbelmynë''' was a small white flower that grew in particular abundance on graves and tombs, like the [[Barrowfield]] of the [[Kings of Rohan]] beneath the walls of [[Edoras]]<ref name=TTIII6>{{TT|III6}}</ref>; and most thickly on the grave of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]].<ref>{{App|A2}}</ref>  It was referred to as '''''[[uilos]]''''' when Tuor saw these flowers in the great ravine between the Fourth Gate, the [[Gate of Writhen Iron]], and the Fifth Gate that was made of white marble, when he was making his way to [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>  Another Elven name for this flower was '''''[[alfirin]]''''', which grew on the low mound that was the tomb of [[Elendil]] upon the summit of [[Amon Anwar]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

It grew in turf but small and white like the wood anemone. Though the plant bloomed at all seasons, its flowers were not 'immortelles'.<ref name="N">{{HM|N}}, p. 780</ref> 
==Etymology==
''Simbelmynë'' was the name of the flower in [[Rohan]], meaning "[[Evermind]]",<ref name=TTIII6/> a reference to the memories of the dead on whose tombs the flower grew. The name thus resembles 'forget-me-not', but a quite different kind of flower is intended. The [[Elves]] called them ''uilos'' and ''alfirin''.

The spelling does not appear to be completely fixed. Within ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and in most other sources, its name is spelt ''simbelmynë''. However, there is at least one recorded instance where Tolkien prefers ''symbelmynë''.<ref>{{L|93}}</ref> These variations do not affect the meaning of its name.

It has been suggested that Tolkien derived ''simbelmynë'' from the [[Old English]] words ''simbel'' ("ever") and ''myne'' ("mind").<ref>John Tinkler, "Old English in Rohan," in ''[[Tolkien and the Critics]]'', ed. N.D. Isaacs and R.A. Zimbardo (1968), p. 168</ref>

==Inspiration==
Tolkien mentioned that Simbelmyne is an imagined variety of anemone. In appearance, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] compares Simbelmynë to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemone_nemorosa European anemone], a small white flower growing among the grass or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatilla_vulgata Anemona pulsatilla], the "pasque flower"<ref name="N"/>.
