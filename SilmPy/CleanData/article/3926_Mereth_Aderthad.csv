[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Mereth Aderthad.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''Mereth Aderthad'']]The '''Mereth Aderthad''' ("Feast of Reuniting") was the great celebratory feast held at the order of [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Fingolfin]] in the [[First Age 20|twentieth year after]] the first rising of the [[Sun]]<ref group=note>[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] gives the date of {{FA}} 21, giving a different interpretation of the line "when twenty years of the Sun had passed"</ref>. The feast was held by the [[Pools of Ivrin]], under the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]] to the north of [[Beleriand]]. Its purpose was to unite all of the divided [[Elves]] in one cause, and ambassadors came from all the peoples and realms of Beleriand. As well as Elves from the separate branches of the [[Noldor]], native [[Sindar|Grey-elves]] were also present, including some from [[Doriath]] and the [[Falas]]. Ambassadors even came from the [[Green-elves]], the people of distant [[Ossiriand]] in the east.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> 

The Feast was hailed as a great success, and the Elves made common cause there against their great enemy to the north. For a few short years after the Mereth Aderthad, Beleriand enjoyed a time of peace and happiness before it was plunged into the [[Battles of Beleriand|Wars]] that would eventually destroy it.
