'''Shelob's Lair''' is a manuscript page by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] for ''[[The Two Towers]]''. It is kept at the [[Bodleian Library]] (MS. Tolkien Drawings 81). The manuscript, featuring a sketch of [[Shelob's Lair]] and the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], was first written in pencil, before Tolkien went over it in ink.<ref name=Bodleian>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://medievalromance.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/J_R_R_Tolkien_The_Lord_of_the_Rings|articlename=The Romance of the Middle Ages: J.R.R.

A cropped version of the manuscript was first published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings 1977 Calendar]]'', together with the following note by [[Christopher Tolkien]]:

"''The writing accompanying this picture is a fragment of an early draft of the passage in [[The Two Towers]] (Book IV, Chapter 8, [[The Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]) in which is described [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s first sight of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. In this draft [[Gollum]] had already disappeared at this point in the story.''"

In [[1995]], a full reproduction of the manuscript appeared in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator|J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator]]'' (p. 175, drawing 171).

In [[2012]], the manuscript was displayed at the exhibition ''The Romance of the Middle Ages'' (also reproduced in the [[The Romance of the Middle Ages|accompanying exhibition book]]).<ref name=Bodleian/>
