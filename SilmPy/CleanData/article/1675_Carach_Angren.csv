'''Carach Angren''' or '''Isenmouthe''' was a pass in the northwest of [[Mordor]].  The pass was formed where spurs reaching out from the ranges of the [[Ephel Dúath]] and the [[Ered Lithui]] met, leaving only a narrow passage between the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] and the smaller valley of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] to the north.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

==History==
As the passage to the [[Black Gate]] of the Morannon, Carach Angren was heavily fortified, and both the rocky spurs that overlooked it carried fortresses and watchtowers. Across the passage itself, a wall of earth had been built, and a great ditch had been dug across the opening spanned by a single bridge.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Both ''Carach Angren'' and ''Isenmouthe'' mean "Iron-mouth": "''It was so called because of the great fence of pointed iron posts that closed the gap leading into Udûn, like teeth in jaws.''"<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref> The [[Sindarin]] name ''Carach Angren'' comes from ''[[carach]]'' "jaws" and ''[[angren]]'' "iron".

''Isen'' is an old English variant form of iron; and mouthe represents [[Old English]] ''mūða'' < ''mūð'' "opening, mouth" especially used of the mouths of rivers, but also applied to other openings.<ref name="Nomen"/>

Despite the Old English, the name is not to be understood as [[Rohirric]], but rather as archaic [[Westron]], translation of [[Sindarin]] ''Carach Angren''.<ref name="Nomen"/>
