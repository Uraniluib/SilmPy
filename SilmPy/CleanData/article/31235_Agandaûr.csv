'''Agandaûr''' is one of the main characters and antagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''.

==History==

===Early Life===
Agandaûr's birth date, aswell as most of his personal details, are unknown. He must have started to serve Sauron somewhere in the [[Third Age]]. Agandaûr became a great warrior and sorcerer, likely being taught by Sauron himself.<ref name="Citadeltower"/>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Agandaûr fights Elladan and Elrohir.jpg|300px|thumb|'''Agandaûr''' fights [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].]]At the same time that the [[Nazgûl]] were sent to retrieve the [[One Ring]], [[Agandaûr]] was sent north to conquer [[Eriador]] and destroy [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3Dq8E9I_9YY4s%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded|articlename=The Black Númenórean|dated=1 February 2011|website=Youtube|accessed=21 February 2012}}</ref> He assembled an army in [[Fornost]] of [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Prologue">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref> In Fornost he took [[Tharzog]], chieftain of the Orcs of [[Mount Gram]], into his service<ref name="backstory"/> and passed his knowledge of sorcery to the Orcs.<ref name="Citadeltower"/>

Just shortly after the [[Nazgûl]] defeated the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] at [[Sarn Ford]], Agandaûr met there with the [[Witch-king]]. Telling him he had finished the preparations and was ready to attack, as assistance for the Nine Riders in the [[Hunt of the Ring]]. The Witch-king ordered him to return and attack immediately.<ref name="Prologue"/>

After his return to Fornost his soldiers captured a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]], named [[Beleram]], who was spying on his forces. On [[Aragorn]]'s order [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]], [[Andriel]], an [[Elves|Elf]] loremaster from [[Rivendell]], and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], infiltrated Fornost to stop the army of Orcs from joining the Nazgûl. When they found the chained Eagle, they helped him to escape.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> When they met with two more infiltrators, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], they formed a team to kill Agandaûr.<ref name>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> After they fought a way to the citadel tower Eradan, Andriel and Farin dealt with Tharzog while Elladan and Elrohir confronted Agandaûr. Tharzog was killed but Agandaûr had the upper hand in his battle with the Half-elves. However, when the Half-elves where joined by Eradan, Andriel and Farin, he fled on the back of a [[Fell beast]]. Even though Beleram pursued him in the air, Agandaûr escaped the Eagle's clutches by summoning a thunder storm.<ref name="Citadeltower"/>

==Inspiration==
Agandaur's conversation with Urgost appears to be based on that of Dain and the man from Mordor mentioned in ''The Council of Elrond''.
