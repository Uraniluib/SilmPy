The '''Quettaparma''', or '''Λεξικό της Quenya, της γλώσσας των υψηλών ξωτικων του J.R.R.Tolkien''' (Greek: "A Lexicon of [[Quenya]], language of the High Elves of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]"), is a Lexicon that lists all [[Quenya]] words and translates them to Greek language, and the opposite. 

The title is [[neo-Quenya]] for "word-book", a word invented to mean "dictionary".

The book, which features roughly 180 pages from Elvish to Greek and another 180 from Greek to Elvish, has also several drawings by ''Xristina Prousanidou'' and a prologue written by the author explaining the importance of this book to all greek Tolkien fans.
