'''Book Description'''

The author of Walking with Frodo takes readers on an adventure of faith with a new devotional that relates themes from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Hobbit]] to living the Christian life. Unlike the fateful quest [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] was asked to carry out, [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s journey came as an unexpected adventure. Readers will be reminded that God chooses us to be unlikely heroes in the adventure of life.
