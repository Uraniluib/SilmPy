'''Hyarastorni''' was an area in [[Mittalmar]], the central region of [[Númenor]]. During the reign of [[Tar-Meneldur]] the lord of Hyarastorni was [[Hallatan]], who was known as the [[Sheep-lord]] since the pasturelands of Mittalmar were commonly used for the grazing of sheep.

In {{SA|882}}, [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] came to the [[White House of Erendis]]. He was received so coldly that he stayed but one night and then departed to the house of his cousin, Hallatan. Arriving in Hyarastorni, Aldarion beheld the warm homecoming that his companion [[Ulbar]] was enjoying. In a mixture of wrath and bitterness he gave Ulbar's wife a fiery red jewel that had been meant for [[Erendis]] and then rode away for [[Armenelos]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
