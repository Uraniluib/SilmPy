===From the Publisher===
In [[The People's Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien]], the first guide written by the people for the people -- that is, the people who love Middle-earth -- the authors from the #1 Tolkien fan website looked at a variety of big themes surrounding the fictional worlds Tolkien created. What made this book different is that the fans, not the scholars, were defining the issues and offering a fresh and unique perspective not seen before in print. With More People's Guide to JRR Tolkien, the indispensable companion volume that fans have been asking for has arrived.
