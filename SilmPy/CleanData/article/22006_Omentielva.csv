'''Omentielva''' (also the International Conference on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Invented Languages) is a biennial scholarly conference for the invented languages of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The name of the conference comes from the [[Quenya]] word for "meeting", ''[[omentie]]''. The meetings are all numbered using the appropriate Quenya ordinal. Thus, the first meeting is called Omentielva Minya (literally "first meeting").
