{{lolcantos}}
This [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Canto]] speaks of [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] after the departure of [[Beren]] and how she went to her mother [[Melian]] and friend [[Dairon]], begging for aid, from the first foresight and from the second music.  Melian said that Beren was in the dungeons of [[Thû]], and Dairon refused to play any music.  A second time Dairon betrayed her, this time out of love, to her father [[Thingol]], who placed her in a guarded treehouse.  But by magic she grew out her hair and made a robe and rope of it "a magic dress / that all was drenched in drowsiness".  Lowering the rope she put to sleep her guards and escaped.

==Concerning the Canto==

After Beren is gone, the forest falls into solemn silence:

<blockquote>
''So days drew on from the mournful day;<br>
''the curse of silence no more lay<br>
''on Doriath, though Dairon's flute<br>
''and Lúthien's singing both were mute.<br>
</blockquote>

Lúthien sings only quietly this medley of mourning:

<blockquote>
'' 'Endless roll the waters past!<br>
''To this my love hath come at last,<br>
''enchanted waters pitiless,<br>
''a heartache and a loneliness.'<br>
</blockquote>

After learning from Melian of Beren's fate, she seeks comfort in Dairon, begging him to make her music to aid her heart.

<blockquote>
'' On earth she cast her at his side.<br>
'' 'O Dairon, Dairon, my tears,' she cried,<br>
'' 'now pity for our old days' sake!<br>
'' for heart's despair, and for heart's dread<br>
'' for light gone dark and laughter dead!'<br>
</blockquote>

But "for music dead there is no note", replies Dairon, though he plays a wailing melody that causes all creatures, birds and elves, to forget their happiness.  Though Lúthien entreats him then to come with her to seek Beren, he replies firmly

<blockquote>
''   'Wherefore,' said he, 'should Dairon go<br>
''into direst peril earth doth know<br>
''for the sake of mortal who did steal<br>
''his laughter and joy? No love I feel<br>
''for Beren son of Barahir,<br>
''nor weep for him in dungeons drear,<br>
''who in this wood have chains enow,<br>
''heavy and dark.  But thee, I vow,<br>
''I will defend from perils fell<br>
''and deadly wandering into hell.'<br>
</blockquote>

This indeed does Dairon do, for he warns the King of Lúthien's apparent madness.  Thingol "in angry love and half in fear" locks her up in a treehouse, not wanting to bind her in his caverns.  Lúthien, though forgiving Dairon, pines for Beren.

<blockquote>
''   Yet long the hours when she must sit<br>
''and see the sunbeams dance and flit<br>
''in beechen leaves, or watch the stars<br>
''peep on clear nights between the bars<br>
''of beechen branches.  And one night<br>
''just ere the changing of the light<br>
''a dream there came, from the Gods, maybe,<br>
''or Melian's magic.  She dreamed that she<br>
''heard Beren's voice o'er hill and fell<br>
'' 'Tinúviel' call, 'Tinúviel.'<br>
''And her heart answered 'Let me be gone<br>
''to seek him no others think upon!'<br>
</blockquote>

Following is a detailed description of her magic art to grow out her hair.  Then she weaves them with a borrowed loom

<blockquote>
''. . . Of cloudy hair<br>
''she wove a web like misty air<br>
''of moonless night, and thereof made<br>
''a robe as fluttering-dark as shade<br>
''beneath great trees, a magic dress<br>
''that all was drenched with drowsiness.<br>
</blockquote>

And finally as the sun goes down she causes the guards to fall asleep with the rope, and

<blockquote>
''Now clad as in a cloud she hung;<br>
''now down her ropéd hair she swung<br>
''as light as squirrel, and away,<br>
''away, she danced, and who could say<br>
''what paths she took, whose elvish feet<br>
''no impress made a-dancing fleet?<br>
