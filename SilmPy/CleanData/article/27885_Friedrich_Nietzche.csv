'''Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche''' ([[15 October|October 15]], [[1844]] – [[25 August|August 25]], [[1900]]) was a 19th-century German philosopher and classical philologist. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science.

Although [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and Nietzsche both were philologists, it is unknown if Tolkien ever read any work of Nietzsche, and few comparative studies have appeared. One study, however, is the article "''Über''hobbits: Tolkien, Nietzsche, and the Will to Power", written by [[Douglas K. Blount]] and published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy|The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy: One Book to Rule Them All]]''. Yet another article (first presented as a paper at the Tolkien conference at Exeter College, Oxford, in August 2006), the more lengthy "Frodo or Zarathustra: Beyond Nihilism in Tolkien and Nietzsche" by [[Peter M. Candler, Jr.]], was published in ''[[Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings – Sources of Inspiration|Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: Sources of Inspiration]]''. The latter "''explores the intricate relationships between philology, creativity, creation, myths, the return to the past and the recurrence of things as discussed by Nietzsche and Tolkien''"<ref>[http://www.walking-tree.org/cormareBookInfo.php?number=18 Walking Tree Publishers] as of July 23, 2010</ref>.
