{{quote|[Faramir] is bold, more bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field.

'''Faramir''' ({{TA|2983}} – {{FoA|82}}, aged 120 years) was the last [[Ruling Steward|Ruling]] [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] and the first [[Prince of Ithilien]]. 

The second of [[Denethor]]'s two sons, Faramir was briefly the [[Ruling Steward]] after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]], he laid down his office, but Elessar renewed the hereditary appointment of Steward as the advisor to the King. Faramir was also appointed Prince of Ithilien.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 207</ref>

==History==
Faramir was born in {{TA|2983}}, five years after [[Boromir]]. Faramir was five when his mother [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]] died. When that happened Boromir and Faramir formed a great bond with each other. 
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Brothers study.jpg|left|thumb|Catherine Chmiel - ''Brothers study'']]
He grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother he did not care much for battle and arms. He loved lore and music, and his gentle nature (and love of [[Gandalf]]) displeased his father.<ref>{{HM|guide}}, entry "Faramir"</ref>

[[Denethor]] grew cold and grim and favored Boromir over Faramir. But there was no rivalry between the brothers.

During [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]] which started the [[War of the Ring]], the two brothers commanded the defences of [[Osgiliath]]. They protected the last bridge across the [[Anduin]] until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Later during the War, Faramir went to command the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].
===In Ithilien===
[[File:John Howe - Faramir 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Faramir'']]
Faramir acted as a ranger harassing [[Haradrim]] and keeping evil things from entering [[Ithilien]] from [[Minas Morgul]]. During one such raid he found [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gollum]] observing an attack by his rangers on a column of [[Haradrim]]. The former two were captured as spies by the rangers though Gollum eluded them. Frodo was questioned by Faramir concerning their errand. Frodo recounted the journeys of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] and its members but referred to the [[Quest of the Ring|purpose]] of the travels only cryptically. During the questioning he denied knowledge of Gollum but revealed that he travelled with both [[Aragorn]], the [[Heir of Isildur]], and [[Boromir]].<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Window on the West.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Window on the West'']]
Faramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement in it, though Frodo had not known of Boromir's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Faramir led Frodo and Sam, blindfolded, to [[Henneth Annûn]]. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the hobbits' errand was linked to the 'Isildur's bane' that had sent Boromir to [[Rivendell]] in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Faramir delivered his famous oath, saying that he "...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were [[Minas Tirith]] falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs". In a slip up however Samwise revealed the nature of 'Isildur's bane' and so Faramir was tested, just as Boromir had been, by the lure of The Ring. Where Boromir failed Faramir succeeded, leading Samwise to remark that Faramir had "shown [his] quality".<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>

During the night, Faramir's watch spotted Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Faramir called Frodo to him who confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, begging Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. The following morning Faramir released Frodo and Sam (with Gollum), but warned them strongly against taking the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{TT|IV6}}</ref>

===In Pelennor/Minas Tirith===

Faramir returned to [[Osgiliath]] after his encounter with the hobbits, supervising the defence there. However he retreated over the [[Pelennor Fields]] to report to Denethor and was almost caught by the [[Nazgûl]] on their [[Fell beasts]], but was saved by [[Gandalf]]. Faramir reached Minas Tirith, telling Denethor and Gandalf of what befell in Ithilien, but soon departed to supervise the defences at his father's bidding. In this venture the host of the [[Witch-king]] came upon Osgiliath and Faramir was struck down by the [[Black Breath]]. Only a sortie by [[Imrahil]] and his knights saved the wounded (including Faramir) from that onset.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Sun Unveiled.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Sun Unveiled'']]
Faramir remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Ring. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]] Denethor planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Faramir was once again saved by Gandalf, though Denethor completed his suicide.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref> After this he was taken to the [[Houses of Healing]] and healed by [[Aragorn]] after the battle.<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref> Faramir spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met [[Éowyn]], also grievously wounded.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> The two fell in love and were married after the war.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

===After the War of the Ring===

After the destruction of the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Faramir, as Steward, led the ceremony in the crowning of [[Aragorn]] as King of Gondor and Arnor.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> Aragorn reinstated the original role of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]] before the failing of the [[Kings of Gondor]] and made Faramir the [[Prince of Ithilien]]. As Prince of Ithilien, Faramir was one of the two Chief Commanders of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and his duty was to guard and maintain the eastern borders of Gondor. He also defeated the remaining enemies and cleansed the [[Morgul Vale]].

Faramir and Éowyn settled down in [[Emyn Arnen]], a range of hills in Ithilien in sight of [[Minas Tirith]], and Faramir became the [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]]. He and Éowyn had at least one son named [[Elboron]],<ref name="Elboron"/> who followed his father as Steward and Prince of Ithilien when Faramir died in the year {{FoA|82}}. Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large percentage of pure [[Dúnedain]] ancestry he possessed as a member of the Gondorian nobility.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>

== Inspirations ==
Faramir was, in the words of Tolkien, "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful".<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> His appearance toward the end of ''[[The Two Towers]]'' apparently was as much of a surprise to Tolkien as it is to his readers. "I am sure I did not invent him," he wrote. "I did not even want him, though I like him".<ref>{{L|66}}</ref> 

Faramir in many ways speaks for Tolkien, who was an officer in the British Army during [[World War I]], when he says, for example, "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness... I love only that which they defend".<ref name="Window">{{TT|Window}}</ref> Much later, Tolkien would write, "As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir".<ref>{{L|180}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Translation of Faramir is not given, not even if it is Quenya or [[Sindarin]].

As all the [[Kings of Gondor]] and their heirs had names in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{App|F1ii}}</ref> and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] son of [[Ondoher]]) the name apparently is Quenya.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
A major player in the second half of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Faramir has found his portrayal both diminished and expanded.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Faramir's role has been omitted. However, a young black-haired man is shown at [[Aragorn]]'s coronation, sitting on a horse beside [[Éowyn]]. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Faramir. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Faramir is voiced by [[Andrew Seear]]. Because Boromir already named him during the Council of Elrond - in the book, he is simply called "my brother" - much of the mystery surrounding Faramir's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. However, unlike some adaptations Faramir's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Eowyn are included, as is his role at Aragorn's coronation.

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Faramir is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:[[David Wenham]] plays Faramir in this adaptation. He does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them west to [[Osgiliath]], crossing the river [[Anduin]], and not until the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character.{{citation needed}} [[Peter Jackson]]'s explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at [[Cirith Ungol]] was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character ''development'', which meant that Faramir had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring.

:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and favouring Boromir, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Faramir's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.
