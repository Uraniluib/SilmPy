'''The Old Forest''' is the sixth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] prepared to depart with [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Merry warned the others that the [[Old Forest|forest]] had always seemed alive with noises, movements and sounds. As they moved through, the forest seemed to close in on them. After some time they came to the River [[Withywindle]], and Merry realized that they had been travelling in exactly the opposite direction that they had meant to go in. As they walked along the only path in sight, the [[Hobbits]] were overcome with drowsiness. Unable to go on any longer, they gave in and fell asleep.

[[Old Man Willow]] then attacked the Hobbits, trapping Pippin and attempting to trap Merry as well. An old man named [[Tom Bombadil|Tom]] came along and sang a song about his wife [[Goldberry]]. With his song, Tom commanded Old Man Willow to release the captured Hobbits.

Tom then took the travellers home with him. When they reached his house, they heard the sweetest voice singing and welcoming them from inside the house.
