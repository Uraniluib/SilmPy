'''Aranarth''' ({{TA|1938}} - {{TA|2106|n}}, died aged 168) was the first of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], and would have been the sixteenth [[King of Arthedain]] had [[Angmar]] not destroyed the realm.

==History==
Aranarth was the son of [[Fíriel]], the daughter of King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]], and [[Arvedui]], son of King [[Araphant]] of Arthedain, and as such, he was descended from both [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]. 

When he was only young, the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] destroyed the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] and overran [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]].  Most of the remnants of the [[Dúnedain]] fled over the [[Lhûn|Lune]] into [[Lindon]].  However, Aranarth's father held out upon the [[North Downs]] until he escaped to the north.  After hiding in abandoned dwarf-mines in the [[Blue Mountains]] the King and his men sought the help of the [[Lossoth]], who gave them grudging aid. 

Aranarth reported to [[Círdan]] of the King's flight to the north.  Círdan sent a ship to the [[Icebay of Forochel]] to seek and rescue him. However, the hull of the ship was broken on the ice and all of the passengers drowned (including Arvedui) and the two ''[[palantíri]]'' the King had secured from the fall of Fornost were lost.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> 

As the heir of Arvedui, this made Aranarth the King of Arthedain (and nominally the claimed title of [[Kings of Arnor|King of Arnor]]), but he did not claim this title as the kingdom had been destroyed. He instead claimed the title of [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], and with the remnants of the Dúnedain (thenceforth known as the [[Rangers of the North]]) he rode with [[Eärnur]] of Gondor to destroy the kingdom of Angmar.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Aranarth's son [[Arahael]] was born and raised in [[Rivendell]], as were all the sons of chieftains after him; and [[Elrond]] was entrusted with the safekeeping of the heirlooms of the North-kingdom: the [[Ring of Barahir]], the shards of [[Narsil]], the [[Star of Elendil]], and the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]].<ref name="Eriador"/>

Aranarth died in 2106, after ruling for 131 years - longer than any other chieftain.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Aranarth's name is [[Sindarin]] and means "Noble King", coming from ''[[aran]]'' meaning "king", and ''[[arth]]'' meaning "noble, loftly".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Early drafts of [[Appendix A]] list Aranarth's date of birth as {{TA|1938}},<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> but in [[Appendix A]], "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"<ref name="Gondor"/> and in the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]], his parents' wedding year is given {{TA|1940}}.<ref name="TA"/>
