'''Frodo Lives!''' was a popular phrase during the 1960s and 1970s by fans of [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Lord of the Rings]] to express their excitement that [[Frodo Baggins]] made it through the story alive. The phrase took on a cult following, often associated with the hippie culture, and appeared written on walls, buttons, shirts, et cetera.

The term first became popular because of an increase in the availability and number of readers of the novel following release of the first paperback edition, which, up until that point, had been subject to rather mixed reviews. While no longer as pervasive as it once was, the term continues to appear regularly in newspaper articles and popular culture related to Tolkien's stories.
