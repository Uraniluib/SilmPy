'''Celebrant''' (translated as '''Silverlode''') was a stream rising in the eastern [[Misty Mountains]] from the [[Mirrormere]] in the [[Dimrill Dale]]. It then ran through [[Lothl처rien]] where it was met by the [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]] river, and emptied into the [[Anduin]]. 
==History==
In {{TA|2994}} an army of orcs came up the Silverlode and wiped out the colony of Dwarves dwelling in [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

Around [[November]] {{TA|3018}} [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], sent by [[Elrond]] to a secret errand, passed down the Silverlode into a "strange country" and were the last to return to [[Rivendell]], in [[December]].<ref name=south/>

The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] followed this river when they travelled from Moria to Lothl처rien.<ref name=south>{{FR|II3}}</ref>
