'''Harper''' was the apprentice of [[Alf]] after he became the new [[Master Cook]] for the village of [[Wootton Major]].  When Alf was ready to leave the village he said that Master Harper was a very good cook (and he was also from the village, unlike Alf).<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''</ref>
