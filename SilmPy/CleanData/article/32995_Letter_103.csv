==Summary==
After being elected to the Merton Professorship of English Language and Literature, Tolkien became a Professorial Fellow of [[Wikipedia:Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]].  After being admitted, said Tolkien, he had to endure the most formidable College Meeting he had ever seen.  He entered his name for college housing and got his Master Key to all gates and doors.  It was incredible, he said, to belong to a real college, one that was large and wealthy.  He walked around with [[Hugo Dyson|Dyson]], who had also just been elected and got the rooms Tolkien had wanted.
