'''''Ruins of the North''''' is a [[2015]] supplement for [[The One Ring (role-playing game)|The One Ring]] role-playing game, complementing the earlier supplement ''[[Rivendell (The One Ring role-playing game)|Rivendell]]''.

==Official description==

Children kidnapped in the night, unusually cunning Trolls, a mysterious caravan, the fate of a company of Hobbits, the legacy of the Dúnedain and an evil awakening beneath the barrows – six new stories set in the ancient land of Eriador. Six adventures that need a company of heroes to undertake them.

''Ruins of the North'' contains six ready-to-play adventures, complete scenarios that can be played separately or as an epic series spanning a number of years. All adventurers are set in the years prior to 2977, and take place in the lands surrounding Rivendell.

''Ruins of the North'' complements the background and rules material contained in ''[[Rivendell (The One Ring role-playing game)|Rivendell]]'', the latest supplement for The One Ring Roleplaying Game based upon ''The Hobbit''™ and ''The Lord of the Rings''™.

Delve into the ruins of overgrown Fornost, walk amidst the cairns of the Barrow-downs and venture to the lair of the Witch-king of Angmar himself, the ancient city of Carn Dûm — if you have the courage!
