'''''The Book of Ishness''''' was a sketchbook, begun by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] on [[6 January]] [[1914]], where he collected illustrations devoted to "imaginative subjects".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 49</ref>

[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that Tolkien's creation of the word ''ishness'' might have been inspired by a passage in chapter 7 of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'': "did you ever see a thing as a drawing of a muchness!".<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 65 (note 13)</ref>
