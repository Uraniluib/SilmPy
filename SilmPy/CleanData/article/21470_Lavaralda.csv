'''Lavaralda''' was a tree from [[Tol Eressëa]] brought to [[Númenor]] by the [[Eldar]].<ref name=LR/>

It had long green leaves which were golden on the undersides. Its flowers were pale with a yellow brush and a faint but clear odour that brought rest and great content. Lavaralda flowered in thick branches and it rested from flowering only at seldom and rare times.<ref name=LR>{{LR|P1III2}}, pp. 57-58</ref>
