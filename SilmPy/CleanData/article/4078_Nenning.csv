'''Nenning''' was a river of western [[Beleriand]] that rose in an isolated hilly region south of the [[Ered Wethrin]], and flowed southwards to meet the sea at [[Eglarest]], one of the two great [[Havens of the Falas]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> It was considered to be the border between [[Círdan]]'s lands to the west and the realm of [[Nargothrond]] to the east.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

In the year after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Morgoth]] sent columns of [[Orcs]] down the rivers [[Brithon]] and Nenning to attack the Havens. They were successful, capturing the havens and enslaving most of [[Círdan]]'s folk.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
