{{disambig-more|Horn|[[Horn (disambiguation)]]}}
The '''Horn-call''' or '''Horn-cry of Buckland''' was the alarm signal of the [[Hobbits]] of [[Buckland]], calling them to action against invaders and incursions into their land.

==History==
The Horn-call of Buckland was an emergency signal and as such had not often been used.  One sounding had been to warn of [[White Wolves]] crossing the frozen [[Brandywine]] in the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]]<ref name="Knife">{{FR|I11}}</ref> of {{TA|2911|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

After that, it had not been blown again for a hundred and seven years; the [[Brandybucks]] used the horn on [[30 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> when [[Fredegar Bolger]] gasped out that invaders, the [[Nazg√ªl|Black Riders]], had intruded into Buckland.  The alarm caused the Black Riders to depart from [[Crickhollow]] and ride through the [[Buckland Gate|North Gate]].<ref name="Knife"/>

[[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] was the next to sound the Horn-cry of Buckland on [[2 November]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> using the [[Horn of the Mark]], rousing the Shire-folk against the [[Ruffians]] who had taken control of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
