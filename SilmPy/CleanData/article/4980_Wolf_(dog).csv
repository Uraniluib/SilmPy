{{disambig-more|Wolf|[[Wolf (disambiguation)]]}}
'''Wolf''' was one of the three [[Dogs|dogs]] kept by [[Farmer Maggot]], a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]]. The folk of the [[Marish]] near the Shire's eastern borders were untrusting of strangers and cautious of intruders. Farmer Maggot was one of these, and to protect himself from unwanted visitors he kept three large dogs: [[Grip]], [[Fang (dog)|Fang]] and Wolf. All three dogs were wolf-like in appearance, which is doubtless the source of Wolf's name. Of the three, circumstantial evidence suggests that Wolf was the largest, and the one who threatened [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] when he encountered Maggot while travelling to [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>
