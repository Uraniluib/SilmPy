==Summary==
Tolkien had just returned from a very poor production of "[[Wikipedia:Arms and the Man|Arms and the Man]]".  While at the theatre he saw [[Charles Williams|C. Williams]] with the lady who was typing Ring and hoped to send Christopher more of it soon.  If not for Christopher seeing it he did not think he should write more, being engaged in revision.  Now that it was old enough for a detached view he thought the chapter, "[[The King of the Golden Hall|King of the Golden Hall]]"<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref> was rather good.
