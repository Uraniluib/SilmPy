The '''Alley of Roses''' was a street in [[Gondolin]], the northern entrance to the [[Square of the Palace]].  During the [[Fall of Gondolin]] it was burned and destroyed by [[Fire-drakes]].  It is mentioned in the Fall that it was once a fair place to walk in, and it can be assumed from its name that it was a sort of garden-street bordered by roses.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 183</ref>
