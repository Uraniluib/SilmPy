The '''Shirebourn''' is a lesser river of [[the Shire]]'s [[Eastfarthing]]. Its source was in the uplands of the [[Green Hill Country]], from where it flowed south and then southeast, where it matched the boundary with the [[Southfarthing]]. At [[Willowbottom]], it met the [[Thistle Brook]], and then flowed eastwards.

The Shirebourn flowed into the Brandywine beneath [[Deephallow]], and at its mouth formed the boggy region known as the [[Overbourn Marshes]], opposite the [[Haysend|southern end]] of the [[High Hay]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> Its outflow was the [[Mithe]].<ref>{{ATB|2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Shirebourn'' means "Bright-stream". However, in most translations, it is translated "River of the Shire" instead.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. lix</ref>
