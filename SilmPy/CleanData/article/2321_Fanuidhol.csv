'''Fanuidhol''' was one of the three peaks in the [[Misty Mountains]] (with [[Caradhras]] and [[Celebdil]]) that lay above the ancient dwarf-city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>
A short name used by the [[Dwarves]] was '''Shathûr''' - in full '''Bundushathûr'''. It has the same meaning in [[Khuzdul]] as '''Fanuidhol''' in [[Sindarin]] -  they both mean '''Cloudyhead'''.
==Etymology==
In the common tongue, Fanuidhol was called Cloudyhead. Both Bundushathûr and Fanuidhol translate to this.

Bundushathûr is Khuzdul - the first element "[[bund]]" means "head".
Fanuidhol is  Sindarin, where the second element "[[dol]]" means "head".
