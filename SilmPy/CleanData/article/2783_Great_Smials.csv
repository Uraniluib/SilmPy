The '''Great Smials''' was the ancestral home and many-tunnelled mansion of the [[Took Family]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  It was located in the town of [[Tuckborough]]<ref name="smials">{{TT|III4}}</ref> in the [[Westfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].

== History==
Excavation of the Great Smials was began in {{TA|2683}} by [[Thain]] [[Isengrim Took II]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  It was said that [[Gerontius Took]] lived in the old room in the Great Place of the Tooks for year after year, with both he and the room becoming older and shabbier together (and the room remained unchanged for a century after his death).<ref name="smials"/>

On the night before the [[Battle of Bywater]] in {{TA|3019}}, [[Peregrin Took]] rode to the Great Smials to raise an army of Tooks for the fight.  In the morning he brought back from Tuckborough and the surrounding [[Green Hills]] a hundred Hobbits before the [[Ruffians]] arrived.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

By the end of the first century of the [[Fourth Age]] the Great Smials held one of the largest repositories of historical books and records in the Shire.  In the library, Peregrin Took and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of [[Gondor]].  Here could be found histories and legends related to [[Elendil]] and his heirs, and only here were extensive materials about the history of [[Númenor]] and the arising of [[Sauron]].  ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' was probably assembled here.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'':'''

''The Lord of the Rings Online'' Multiplayer Online game properly features the Great Smials at the center of Tuckborough, with the current Thain residing inside the main hall and many other Tooks living in adjacent Hobbit holes. Players can visit Great Smials at two different points in Timeline: in October of {{TA|3018}} during the peaceful time and later during Summer of {{TA|3019}}, when the Shire is overrun by [[Saruman|Sharkey]]'s brigands. During the later encounter, the Tooks have barricaded themselves inside Smials, which are besieged by Brigands; the player(s) is given the task of thinning their ranks and slaying their leader, preventing the Ruffians from burning the Tooks out.
