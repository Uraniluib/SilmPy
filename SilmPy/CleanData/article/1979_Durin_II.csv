'''Durin II''' (lived sometime during [[First Age]] or early [[Second Age]]<ref group="note">[[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] is described as having died before the end of the First Age, whilst [[Durin III]] received one of the [[Seven Rings]].</ref><ref name="AppDurin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>) was a King of [[Durin's folk]] and Lord of the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves|Father of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name="AppDurin"/>

Little is recorded about his reign, although there are indications that the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] were in a confederation with [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]], where the Men provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items. This cooperation continued until the reign of [[Durin IV]].<ref name="Dwarves">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]], author of ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]] has suggested that this is the Durin named on the [[Doors of Durin]] of Moria, built around {{SA|750}}.<ref>[[Robert Foster]] (1971), ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'',  entry ''DURIN II''</ref>

==Etymology==
''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
