'''''The Hobbit Companion''''' is a book by [[David Day]].
==From the publisher==
Illustrated in full colour (illustrations by [[Lidia Postma]]), including a number of double page prints, this is an intriguing and interesting investigation into the world of words used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It explores the clever web of wordplay Professor Tolkien used to create hidden meanings and delves into the mythical associations that lie beneath the tale's thrilling surface.

Starting with the word "hobbit" itself, the book moves on to examine Bilbo Baggins, hobbit heritage and history, Gandalf, Shire Society, and much more.

There is also a chapter on the hobbit characters from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', including [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]. Lidia Postma’s painting of the [[Party Field]] from ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' is a treasure – it pictures and names 60 of the guests from Adelard Took to Willibald Bolger.
