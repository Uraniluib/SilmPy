The '''Necklace of Girion''' was a marvelous piece of jewelry originally owned by [[Girion]], Lord of [[Dale]].  The necklace was studded with five hundred emeralds as green as grass.

==History==
Prior to the coming of the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]], Girion had traded the necklace to the Dwarves of [[Erebor]] in exchange for a coat of dwarf-linked rings wrought of pure silver that was three times as strong as steel.  The coat was given to Girion's son.<ref name="Inside">{{H|Inside}}</ref>  In {{TA|2770}} Smaug attacked both Dale and the [[Kingdom Under the Mountain]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  and the Necklace became part of Smaug's hoard after the dragon occupied the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Inside"/>

After the death of the dragon, the [[Battle of Five Armies]], and the death of [[Thorin]], [[Dáin II]] became King under the Mountain and dealt the treasure wisely.  [[Bard]], the heir of Girion, returned the [[Arkenstone]] to the Dwarves and in the one-fourteenth share given to Bard came the Necklace of Girion.  Bard then gave the emeralds to the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], who was most fond of such gems, in thanks for the aid the Elves had rendered to the [[Lake-men]] of [[Esgaroth]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
Originally [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had created the ''Gem'' of Girion for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' so as to provide an easily transportable part of the hoard of Smaug for [[Bilbo Baggins]] to carry home.  Changing his mind about having Bilbo slay Smaug, Tolkien introduced Bard into the plot.  The Gem of Girion turned into the [[Arkenstone]] and was made the most coveted part of the treasure for [[Thorin]], and the Necklace of Girion was invented to replace its role in the story.<ref>{{HH|While}}, (ii) ''The Arkenstone as Silmaril'', p. 603</ref>
