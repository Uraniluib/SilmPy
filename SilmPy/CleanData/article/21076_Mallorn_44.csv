'''''Mallorn'' 44''' is the forty-fourth issue of the [[The Tolkien Society]]'s annual (as it was then) journal ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'', published in [[August]] [[2006]]. 

Mallorn 44 was the last issue to be published under the more academic format before the journal was revamped by the new editor, [[Henry Gee]]; as a result of the change of editor and format, [[Mallorn 45]] wasn't published until Spring [[2008]], over 18 months later.
