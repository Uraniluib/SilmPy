'''Salmar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈsalmar]}}) was a [[Maia]]<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> serving [[Ulmo]]. He made the [[Ulumúri]] for his master, the great conches which produce the music of the sea.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref><ref group="note">Salmar is mentioned only once in the narrative and his nature as a Maia is given in the Index, but it is unknown whether that entry was written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] or his son [[Christopher Tolkien]].</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium Salmar is often called by the title '''Noldorin''', and sometimes '''Lirillo'''.<ref>{{LT1|Index}}</ref> He was mentioned to be the brother of [[Ómar]].

==Etymology==
The [[Quenya|Q(u)enya]] name ''Salmar'' is derived from ''salma'' ("lyre, small harp"). ''Lirillo'' is a [[Qenya]] name meaning "Valu of the Song" (containing either ''glîr'' "a song, poem" or ''lir-'' "sing" + masculine ending ''[[-illo]]'').<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13 (footnote 10)</ref>
