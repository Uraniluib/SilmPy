'''Gandalf's Song of Lórien''' was sung by [[Gandalf]] in [[Meduseld]] on [[2 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>, as an answer to [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]'s insulting claim that "webs of deceit were ever woven in [[Dwimordene]]".<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

==Song==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
In Dwimordene, in Lórien
Seldom have walked the feet of Men,
Few mortal eyes have seen the light
That lies there ever, long and bright.
Galadriel! Galadriel!
Clear is the water of your well;
White is the star in your white hand;
Unmarred, unstained is leaf and land
In Dwimordene, in Lórien
More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men.
</poem>
