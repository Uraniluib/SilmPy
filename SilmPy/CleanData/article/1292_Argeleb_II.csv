'''Argeleb II''' ({{TA|1473}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1670|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 197) was the tenth king of [[Arthedain]].
==History==
He succeeded his father, [[Araphor]], upon his death in 1589, at the age of 116. 

In {{TA|1601}}, the twelfth year of Argeleb's reign, many [[hobbits]] migrated from [[Bree]] so Argeleb granted them the land beyond the [[Baranduin]] to dwell in. These hobbits were joined in [[The Shire]] by [[Stoors]] from [[Dunland]] around  {{TA|1630|n}}.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Prior to this, the area of the Shire had been unpopulated and regarded as the king's hunting ground.

In {{TA|1636}} the [[Great Plague]] devastated [[Gondor]] (the [[Telemnar|King]], his children and the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] perished) and moved north to the lands of Argeleb's rule.<ref name="TA"/>  Although the Great Plague decreased in severity as it moved north, there was still much suffering throughout [[Eriador]]; most of the people of [[Cardolan]] perished (especially those living in [[Minhiriath]]) including Cardolan's last prince. The last prince was buried in the [[Barrow-downs]], which was also about the time that evil-spirits started coming from [[Angmar]] to dwell in the Barrow-downs.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

After having ruled for eighty-one years, he was succeeded by his son, [[Arvegil]], upon his death in 1670.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
Argeleb's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Silver King" from ''[[ar]]'' meaning "royal", and ''[[celeb]]'' (becoming lenited to ''geleb'') meaning "silver". It is likely that Argeleb II was named after his great-grandfarther, [[Argeleb I]]
