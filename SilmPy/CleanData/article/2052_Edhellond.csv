'''Edhellond''' was an ancient harbour in southern [[Gondor]]. It had been established south-west of where the [[Ringló]] entered the [[Morthond]],<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> near where the combined waters flowed into [[Cobas Haven]].<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, West, p. 434</ref>

==History==
Edhellond was founded by [[Sindar]] before the end of the [[First Age]], who had come there as refugees from [[Beleriand]] during [[Morgoth]]'s ascendancy. At first, the population of the haven was quite small since the refugees had come in just three small ships, but over time their numbers had been increased by [[Nandor]] who came down the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 247</ref>

From Edhellond Elves began sailing westward from the time of the fall of [[Eregion]] (in {{SA|1697}}<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>).<ref name="Preface">{{ATB|Preface}}</ref>

According to one story, [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] dwelt among the Elves of Edhellond.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 240</ref> Another account states that [[Amroth]] ruled among the [[Silvan Elves]] here in the Second Age.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> 

[[Amroth]], [[King of Lórien]], was lost at sea near Edhellond in {{TA|1981|n}} when he attempted to swim to shore to seek his beloved [[Nimrodel the Elf-maid|Nimrodel]]. The ship from which he jumped overboard was the last ship of [[Elves]] to leave from Edhellond, which was deserted from then on,<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, pp. 241-242</ref> although remembered in the traditions of Men in Gondor.<ref name="Preface"/>

== Etymology ==
Edhellond means "Elf Haven" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[edhel]]'' = "Elf"<ref>{{S|Appendix}} ''edhel''</ref> and ''[[lond]]'' = "harbour, haven"<ref>{{S|Appendix}} ''londë''</ref>).
