The '''Olog-hai''' were a fierce race of [[Trolls]]. They only spoke [[Sauron]]'s [[Black Speech]], and it is possible they only existed because Sauron's evil will empowered them.<ref name=Other>{{App|Other}}</ref> They were bred by Sauron from an unknown stock, though it's suggested that they could be corruptions of some primitive human types.<ref>{{MR|P5IX}}</ref>

==History==
The Olog-hai appeared at the end of the [[Third Age]] in southern [[Mirkwood]] and in the mountainous borders of [[Mordor]]. 

During the [[War of the Ring]], Sauron used Olog-hai in the [[Siege of Gondor]] and [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In the subsequent [[Battle of the Morannon]], the hobbit [[Peregrin Took]] killed a large troll, which may have been an Olog.<ref name=Gate>{{RK|V10}}</ref> As a result of Sauron's ring being destroyed, the [[Black Gate]] and the rest of Mordor collapsed to ruin during that battle. Most of the Trolls present at the battle were killed, with a very few escaping. 

==Appearance==
The Olog-hai had none of the old Troll vulnerabilities: they were very intelligent and able to endure the [[Sun]]. For this reason they were seen by some to be giant [[Orcs]] (though surpassing even the [[Uruk-hai]] in size and power), but they were definitely of Troll stock.<ref name=Other/>

The Olog-hai that fought in the War were described as being taller than a man, and covered in horny scales, carrying hammers and bucklers in their claws.<ref name=Gate/>

==Etymology==
''Olog-hai'' is a term out of the [[Black Speech]]. ''[[Olog]]'' means "troll" and ''[[hai]]'' (as in ''[[Uruk-hai]]'') means "folk".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 136</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/orkish.htm|articlename=Orkish and the Black Speech|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=13 March 2014}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
The original name for these creatures (in the fourth draft of [[Appendix F]]) was ''Horg-hai'', which was changed to ''Olg-hai'' before finally appearing as ''Olog-hai'' in the published text.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Olog-hai, also called ''Black Trolls'', were bred by Sauron from lesser Troll stock. They are nine to eleven feet in height, and have black, scaly hides. They appear much earlier in history than Tolkien indicated, as early as the wars with [[Angmar]].<ref>{{ICE|8004}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2000}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref> Individual Olog-hai include the warlord Rogrog of Angmar<ref>{{ICE|2018}}</ref>, Umagaur<ref name=ICE2011/> and Lugronk<ref name=ICE2011>{{ICE|2011}}</ref>.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Olog-hai were shown as the shock troops in the [[Siege of Gondor]], sporting armor and the famed war hammers alluded to in the appendices. These Olog-hai were not shown talking in any speech other than grunts. They differ from the other Trolls depicted in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'']] in that they have more forward-facing eyes as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of Troll. They are usually gray to black in color. They have twenty-four teeth. Their eyes are also bright orange, showing their evil connection with Sauron.
