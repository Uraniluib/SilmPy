The '''Shire-reckoning''' ([[Gondor Sindarin]]: '''''Genediad Drannail'''''<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref>) was the calendar system used by the [[Hobbits]] in [[the Shire]] and (eventually) in [[Bree]].  

In Bree, Year 1 corresponded to {{TA|1300}}, however the Shire-reckoning counted as Year 1 the year that colonization of the Shire began by the [[Bree-hobbits]] [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]]. Therefore, years of the Third Age can be converted to Shire-years by subtracting 1600.

The last year of the Third Age was year {{SR|1421}}. In the [[New Reckoning]] of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], the year {{FoA|1}} began on [[March 25]], old style.  The Hobbits mostly ignored the change and so for them the first year of the [[Fourth Age]] was just {{SR|1422}}.
