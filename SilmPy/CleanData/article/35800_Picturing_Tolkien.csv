==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|This group of new critical essays offers multidisciplinary analysis of director Peter Jackson's spectacularly successful adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy: ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' (2001), ''The Two Towers'' (2002) and ''The Return of the King'' (2003). Part One of the collection, "Techniques of Structure and Story," compares and contrasts the organizational principles of the books and films. Part Two, "Techniques of Character and Culture," focuses on the methods used to transform the characters and settings of Tolkien's narrative into the personalities and places visualized on screen. Each of the sixteen essays includes extensive notes and a separate bibliography.Janice M. Bogstad is a professor of women's studies and English and is head of technical services at the McIntyre Library, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Her written work has appeared in more than 60 reference books. University of Wisconsin-Madison Emeritus Philip E. Kaveny is an independent scholar, author, playwright, poet and lecturer. In 1976 he cofounded Madison's Feminist Oriented Conference.<ref>[http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4636-0 Picturing Tolkien] at [http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/index.html McFarlandPub.com] (accessed 21 August 2011)</ref>}}
