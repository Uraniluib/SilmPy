The '''Four Shire Stone''' is a 9-foot high pillar situated approximately 25 miles north-west of [[Oxford]] - and two miles east of Moreton-in-Marsh - in England. The pillar, made from Cotswold stone, marks the centuries-old meeting place of four county shires: Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire.

Due to local government reorganisation in the 1970s, the boundaries of these counties have now been moved and only three shires - no longer including Worcestershire, whose boundary is now further west - currently intercept here.

It is believed this stone was an inspiration for [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[Three-Farthing Stone]], a central point in [[the Shire]] where three [[Farthing|Farthings]] met.
