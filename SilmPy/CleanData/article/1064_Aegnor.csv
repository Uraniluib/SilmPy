'''Aegnor''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈa͡ɛɡnor]}}) was a son of [[Finarfin]] and a lord of the [[Noldor]]. He was terrible in battle, seemingly having a fire in his eyes<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>, and his golden hair was stiff and straight. Even at a young age this was noticeable, though he was also known to be a very generous and noble spirit. 

== History ==
Aegnor was the elder brother of [[Galadriel]] and the younger brother of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and [[Angrod]].<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> He had a strong friendship with [[Fingon]] and grace to him, and he followed the Exiles under the host of [[Fingolfin]] with his brother Angrod.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> 

He settled with his brother on the northern slopes of [[Dorthonion]],<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> where, in the reflection of [[Aeluin]], he saw the young [[Andreth]] and they fell in love with each other. However he could not return her love during the [[Siege of Angband]], since according to the law of the [[Eldar]], no marriages are allowed during a time of war. It is said that because of her sake, he would not take any Elven bride.<ref name="Athrabeth">{{MR|P4c}}</ref>

Together with Angrod he held the highlands of [[Dorthonion]] against [[Morgoth]]. Aegnor and Angrod were both slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] by the flames from [[Thangorodrim]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

It was Aegnor's love for Andreth that brought about the memorable conversation between Andreth and Finrod titled ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.<ref name="Athrabeth"/>

== Etymology ==
Aegnor's [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Aikanáro]]''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌa͡ɪkaˈnaːro]}}), meaning "Fell Fire" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[aica]]'' = "fell, dire", ''[[Nár (Quenya)|nár]]'' = "fire", and ''-o'' = pronominal suffix).<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''nár''</ref> 

Like many mother-names, his name was prophetic, a reference to his valiance in battle. His [[father-name]] was '''''[[Ambaráto]]''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌambaˈraːto]}}), meaning "Champion of Doom" (from ''[[ambar]]'' = "doom" and ''[[aráto]]'' = "champion"). ''Aegnor'' is the [[Sindarin]] version of his mother-name.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, ''The names of Finwë's descendants''</ref>
