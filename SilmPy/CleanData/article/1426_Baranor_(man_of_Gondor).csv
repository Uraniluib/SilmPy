}}'''Baranor''' was a man of [[Gondor]] in the [[Third Age]]. 

==History==
Baranor came from a line of [[Gondorians]] of [[Ithilien]] who then moved to the vales of the [[White Mountains]], most likely in [[Lossarnach]]. 

He had a son, [[Beregond]], a hero of the [[siege of Minas Tirith]], and seems to have also dwelt in that city.
