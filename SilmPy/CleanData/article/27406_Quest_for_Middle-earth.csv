'''''Quest for Middle-earth''''' is a 2007 book authored by Dirk Vander Ploeg.
==From the publisher==
In the Quest for Middle-earth Dirk Vander Ploeg suggests that [[The Lord of the Rings]] may be more than an imaginary tale set thousands of years in the past in a place called [[Middle-earth]]! What if [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] weaved his fictional characters into a tapestry created from the secret knowledge of earth's ancient history?" Is there historical and archaeological evidence that supports this position and was any of this knowledge known to Tolkien?

Recent discoveries in Iraq (ancient Sumer, Babylon), Greece and Finland confirm the possibility that intelligent creatures once lived and worked alongside man. There are clues that point to the fact, that as a race, we were the labor force required to serve superior beings - Gods - to create their vision of heaven on earth. 

Discover the truth about the Sang Real (Royal Blood), Rennes-la-Chateau and the Templar Knights!
