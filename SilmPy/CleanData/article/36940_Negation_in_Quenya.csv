'''Negation in Quenya''' is the title of an article by [[Bill Welden]], published in [[Vinyar Tengwar 42|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 42]] ([[2001]]; pp. 32-4).

Welden addresses the issue of how to express negation in [[Quenya]] by quoting from several [[Index:Unpublished material|unpublished manuscripts]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]:

*"Vocabulary list" - probably dating from around [[1960]].<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42e}}</ref>
*"List of roots and derivatives" - dated December [[1959]].<ref name=VT42/> The complete manuscript was later published in [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 17]] ([[2007]]) as "Eldarin Roots and Stems".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 145</ref>
*"Late essay" - likely dating from ca. [[1970]].<ref name=VT42/> Further quotes from this "late essay" appeared in [[Vinyar Tengwar 47|''Vinyar Tengwar'' 47]] ([[2005]]; p. 30, note 44 and p. 37, note 58). Editor [[Patrick H. Wynne]] suggests that the essay was composed in "''late [[1966]] or afterwards''", by noting Tolkien's reference to a question from [[Dick Plotz|Plotz]] (while preparing an [[Index:Interviews with J.R.R. Tolkien|interview]] for ''[[Seventeen]]'') dated November 1966.<ref>{{VT|47a}}, pp. 30 (note 44), 37 (note 58)</ref>
