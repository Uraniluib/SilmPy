'''Falathrin''' was the [[Sindarin]] dialect of the [[Falathrim]] (also used in  [[Nargothrond]]{{fact}}), of which not much is known. It is told that the dialect "was in many ways different" from other forms of Sindarin, but not enough "to interfere with intercourse".<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 380, 411 (note 12)</ref>
