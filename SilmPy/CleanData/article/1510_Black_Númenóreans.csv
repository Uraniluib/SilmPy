The '''Black Númenóreans''' were [[Númenóreans|High Men]] from [[Númenor]]. They were under the [[Shadow]] like the [[King's Men]], cruel oppressors and overlords over the more primitive [[Middle Men]] of [[Middle-earth]]. As they were colonising the continent, they survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]].
==History==
The Númenóreans' power and knowledge had grown throughout the course of the [[Second Age]], and became increasingly preoccupied with the limits placed on their happiness—and eventually their power—by mortality, the purpose of which they began to question. They started fearing the [[Gift of Men]] and attempted to delay it or recall life.

This growing wish to escape death, made most of the Númenoreans envious of the immortal [[Eldar]], who they had come to physically resemble. The Eldar sought ever to remind the men of Númenor however, that death was a gift of the One God, [[Ilúvatar]], to all men, and the will of Ilúvatar could not be gainsaid. 

Nevertheless, after {{SA|2221}}, when [[Tar-Ancalimon]] became [[King of Númenor]], the Númenóreans became divided. The [[King's Men]] who turned away from the [[Valar]] and the Eldar, and eventually became vulnerable to the corruption of [[Sauron]], who dominated the minds and wills of most of the Númenóreans with the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{L|211}}</ref> The powerful and elderly King [[Ar-Pharazôn]], had become frightened of old age,<ref>{{L|156}}</ref> and was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the Valar, and seduced. 

Some indigenous people of Middle-earth were afraid of those Númenóreans, whom they called "[[Go-hilleg]]" in their language. The "Go-hilleg" terrified those people with their ships and intended at some point to conquer the land of [[Agar]] and slay its people.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>

Three of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] can be considered among the first and most powerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by Sauron,<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> 1000 years before the Downfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become so because of their lust for power or knowledge.

Even the colonists who had settled on the shores and seaward regions of the [[Westlands]], turned to evil, the [[Darkness]] and the black arts. These evil lords made their fortresses and dwellings in the [[South]], because of the power of [[Gil-galad]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> <ref name=window>{{TT|Window}}</ref>
===After the Downfall===
For many centuries after the Downfall, these descendants of the King's Men held onto the haven of [[Umbar]], the most northerly and famous of their realms.

When the surviving [[Faithful]] Numenoreans founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]], they saw their southern counterparts as renegades, calling them the Black Númenóreans.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref> The Black Númenóreans held a similar hatred of Gondor after generations.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Two early Black Númenórean lords from the late [[Second Age]] were [[Herumor]] and [[Fuinur]] who desired power over men of other, lesser races, and they "rose to (great) power amongst the [[Haradrim]]", the peoples neighbouring Umbar. They likely shared Sauron's defeat at the hands of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. 

The triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black Númenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. They dwindled swiftly or became merged with the Middle Men.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

[[Berúthiel|Queen Berúthiel]], wife of Gondor's King [[Tarannon Falastur]] was "a black Númenórean".<ref name=Interview>{{webcite|author=[[Daphne Castell]]|articleurl=http://www.festivalintheshire.com/journal1bdx/inttolkien.html|articlename=The Realms of Tolkien|dated=|website=[http://www.festivalintheshire.com/journal1bdx/index.html ''Festival in the Shire Journal'', Issue 1]|accessed=7 May 2012}}</ref><ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[The Inklings (book)|The Inklings]]'', "Thursday evenings", pp. 137-8</ref> This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political accommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies the existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than the much later Mouth of Sauron. 
 
A Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a thousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in [[Haradwaith]]. As late as Third Age 1015, for example, even after being exiled from their homeland for nearly a century, the lords that had been driven from Umbar led the [[Haradrim]] to retake Umbar.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

Not much is known about the Black Númenóreans after their defeat by [[Ciryaher]] in {{TA|1050}}. A "Renegade", [[The Mouth of Sauron]], had entered the service of Sauron in [[Mordor]]. He mocked the army of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] in front of the [[Morannon]].

==Culture==
The Black Númenórean style of governing was no doubt tyrannical, and may also have involved a tradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar. After Herumor and Fuinur there were also [[Angamaite]] and [[Sangahyando]]. Some lords were idle and lazy, they used to fight amongst themselves, until they became conquered by the wild men.<ref name=window/>

The Black Númenóreans did not use [[Westron]], but probably retained their old tongue [[Adûnaic]], speaking a dialect of it. (In [[The Notion Club Papers]], part of ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Arundel Lowdham cited two descendants of classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron, the other the tongue of the Black Númenóreans).

==Portrayal in adaptations==

:The Black Númenóreans are portrayed in service of the different Lieutenants of the Enemy. The ''Angmarim'' inhabit the lands surrounding [[Carn Dum]] in [[Angmar]] and serve [[Mordirith]] and later [[Amarthiel]]. Much later, Umbarrim Númenóreans make appearance in [[Dol Guldur]] of [[Mirkwood]].

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:[[Agandaûr]], the game's main antagonist, is a Black Númenórean<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/the-game/enemies|articlename=Enemies|dated=|website=www.warinthenorth.com|accessed=15 February 2012}}</ref> as is the minor character [[Wulfrun]], lieutenant of [[Carn Dûm]].
