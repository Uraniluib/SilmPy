'''Fengel''' ({{TA|2870}} - {{TA|2953|n}}) was the fifteenth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Fengel was the third and only surviving son of [[Folcwine]], and became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2903}}.

Fengel's two older brothers, [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], were killed in [[Harondor]] while fighting for [[Gondor]], and as a result Fengel grew up rather spoiled. As a grown man he became known for his greed and love of gold.

His son [[Thengel]] left Rohan because of disagreements with his father, living with [[Morwen Steelsheen|his wife]]'s family in [[Gondor]] instead.

After a rule of over 50 years Fengel died in {{TA|2953}}, and Thengel reluctantly returned to Rohan.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Fengel in [[Old English]] means "grasper, lord".
