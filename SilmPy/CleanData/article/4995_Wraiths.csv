'''Wraiths''' was a name for people having been transformed into [[undead]] beings.<ref name=FRI11>{{FR|I11}}</ref> The realm of the wraiths was called the [[Unseen|Wraith-world]].<ref name=FRII1/>

==History==

In the [[Elder Days]], the wraith of [[Gorlim]] appeared in a dream of [[Beren]].<ref>{{S|19}}</ref>

In the [[Second Age]], the [[Men]] of the [[White Mountains]] broke their oath to [[Isildur]]. This crime combined by Isildur's curse turned the [[Oathbreakers]] into shades who haunted the mountains<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref> until the [[Third Age]]. [[Aragorn]] II, in the capacity of the [[Heir of Isildur]], released the Oathbreakers from their curse in return for their aid at [[Pelargir]].<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

In the Third Age, it was rumoured that the wraith of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] haunted the enemies of [[Rohan]], killing those who felt fear.<ref>{{App|A2}}</ref>

The most famous of the wraiths were the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], [[Men]] ensnared by [[Sauron]]'s [[Nine Rings]].<ref name=LotR>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref> Some of the victims of the Ringwraiths, too, could be transformed into wraiths, albeit lesser and under their command (although there are no records of such a being).<ref name=FRII1>{{FR|II1}}</ref> This nearly happened to [[Frodo Baggins]], after having been stabbed by the [[Morgul-knife]] of the [[Witch-king]].<ref name=FRI11/>

==Etymology and Names==

===In the [[Legendarium]]===

The [[Black Speech]]/[[Sindarin]] word ''[[gûl]]'' was translated as "wraith(s)" in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].<ref name=LotR/><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 11</ref><ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/orkish.htm Orkish and the Black Speech: Base Language for Base Purposes]" at [http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 27 December 2010)</ref>

===[[:Category:Real-world|Real-world]]===

''Wraith'' is a Scottish word meaning "ghost" (of uncertain origin; possibly from Gaelic, Irish ''arrach''  "specter, apparition").<ref>Douglas Harper, "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wraith wraith]" at [http://www.etymonline.com Online Etymology Dictionary] (accessed 26 December 2010)</ref><ref>{{HM|RW}}, p. 223</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In a draft for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Appendices]]'', the [[Paths of the Dead]] were said to have been guarded by the "''fell wraiths of the [[Oathbreakers|Forgotten Men]]''".<ref>{{PM|Aii}}, p. 267</ref>

In another draft it is said that the [[Rings of Power]] transformed their bearers into wraiths, thus creating ''elf-'', ''goblin-'', ''men-'', or ''dwarf-wraiths''.<ref>{{RS|Gollum}}, p. 78</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
: Wraiths refers to the category of Unseen beings that includes the [[Nazgûl]] and victims of [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blades]]. The cursed, lingering spirits of Men such as the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men of Dunharrow]] are called Shades and categorized as The Dead. Wraiths appeared as leaders of the Enemy and elite forces in many areas. The most commonly encountered wraiths were the red-robed Cargûl. One of the game's main antagonists, [[Mordirith]], was a wraith who is the Steward of [[Angmar]].
