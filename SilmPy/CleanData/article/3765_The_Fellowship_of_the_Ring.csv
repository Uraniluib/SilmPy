'''''The Fellowship of the Ring, being the first part of The Lord of the Rings''''' is the first of three volumes ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is followed by ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]''. ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was originally released on [[29 July|July 29]], [[1954]] in the United Kingdom.

==Synopsis==
The volume is divided into two books, Book I and II.
===Book I===
The first book sets the stage for the adventure and follows [[Frodo Baggins]] as he flees from his home in [[the Shire]] to escape the minions of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. Sauron seeks [[the One Ring]] that will allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen Lower Rings and control the three major races of Middle-earth: the Elves, the Men and the Dwarves. The One Ring has been inherited by Frodo who finds himself unwittingly in the midst of a struggle for world domination.

The beginning of the first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' which is more of a childrens story than ''Lord of the Rings''. It begins with [[Bilbo Baggins]] celebrating his 111th (or eleventy first, as it is called) birthday, on the same day that Frodo celebrates his 33rd birthday. (His 'coming of age') At the birthday party, Bilbo disappears after his speech, to the surprise of all. Frodo later learns about the ring which he had used to make himself invisible, and also to some of its darker powers.

Heeding the advice of the wizard [[Gandalf]], Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He hopes to reach [[Rivendell]], where he will be safe from Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to do about the Ring.

In his journey he is accompanied by three [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] friends, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. From the start they are pursued by Black Riders, the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]]s who serve Sauron. Narrowly escaping these and other dangers and meeting other interesting characters en route (e.g, [[Tom Bombadil]]) they eventually come to [[Bree]], where they meet [[Aragorn|Strider]], another friend of Gandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell, through further hardships. Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of [[Weathertop]] by the chief of the Nazgul, with a 'morgul blade' - as part of the knife stays inside him, he gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the trolls which had been turned to stone, as is told in the ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

*'''VI - [[The Old Forest]]''' - Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get lost and travel to the River Withywindle, the "queerest part of the whole wood". Merry and Pippin are trapped inside [[Old Man Willow]], and are freed only when [[Tom Bombadil]] arrives.
*'''VII - [[In the House of Tom Bombadil]]''' - Tom knows much about the Hobbits, and even tries on the Ring, yet it does not have any effect on him - it does not make him invisible.

*'''VIII - [[Fog on the Barrow-downs]]''' - Travelling through the [[Barrow-downs]], the hobbits are imprisoned by Barrow-wights, where they are rescued again by Tom Bombadil. The hobbits are given daggers from the treasure in one of the downs.
*'''IX - [[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]''' - The Hobbits reach [[the Prancing Pony]] inn at Bree, where Frodo uses a false name, Underhill. Later, after singing a song on a table, he trips and accidentally puts the ring on his finger, disappearing, which causes a commotion.
*'''X - [[Strider (chapter)|Strider]]''' - Strider who had at first seemed menacing, turns out to be friendly. The innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a letter from Gandalf, which tells him that Strider is a friend of Gandalf's whose real name is Aragorn.
*'''XI - [[A Knife in the Dark]]''' - The hobbits with Strider set out from Bree on foot after their horses had bolted when Black Riders arrived at the inn at night, who had also attacked the beds which they were supposed to be staying in, though Strider had them stay in another room. They buy a pony from Bill Ferny. They pass through the [[Midgewater Marshes]], and reach Weathertop. There they are attacked by five black riders, Frodo puts on the ring to escape them, and is stabbed in the arm by one of them.
*'''XII - [[Flight to the Ford]]''' - They pass the stone trolls, turned to stone in ''The Hobbit''. Eventually, they meet the Elf [[Glorfindel]] from Rivendell, who takes Frodo with him back to Rivendell on his [[Asfaloth|white horse]]. The riders are washed away in a flood over the Ford.

===Book II===

Book II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is hatched to destroy the Ring in [[Mordor]]. At first Frodo meets his uncle [[Bilbo Baggins]] who he had not seen since he left Hobbiton much earlier. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with eight companions: two Men, [[Aragorn]] and [[Boromir]], son of the Steward of the land of [[Gondor]]; an Elven prince, [[Legolas]]; Frodo's old friend and powerful wizard, Gandalf; [[Gimli]] the Dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions.  These Nine Walkers were chosen to represent all the free races of Middle-earth and as a balance to the Nine Riders.  They were also accompanied by [[Bill the Pony]], whom Strider and the Hobbits acquired in Bree as a pack horse.  Their attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] is foiled by heavy snow, so they are forced to take a path under the mountains via [[Moria]], an ancient [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] kingdom, now full of [[Orcs]] and other evil creatures, where Gandalf falls into the abyss after battling a [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. 

The remaining eight members of the Fellowship then spend some time in the elf-haven of [[Lothl&oacute;rien]], where they receive [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] from the elf queen [[Galadriel]] that in many cases prove useful later in the quest. They leave L&oacute;rien by river, but Frodo begins to realize the Ring is having a malevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir, who tries to take the ring from Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the ring to escape him. Later Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart secretly for [[Mordor]] and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.
