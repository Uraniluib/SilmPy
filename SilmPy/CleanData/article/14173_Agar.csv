'''Agar''' was the name for the town and the land in the story of [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]]. On its location little information is given, except that it was a region of green hills, situated "three leagues away" from the shores of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]], and apparently closer to the ocean than the rival town of [[Udul]]. In a note near the end of the story there was a suggestion that the place was on the estuary of the [[Isen]] or perhaps the [[Morthond]]. The town was ruled by a town-master, who was named [[Mogru]] when Tal-Elmar lived in the town.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>
