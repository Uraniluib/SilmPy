'''Three is Company''' is the third chapter of the first book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] prepared to leave on his fiftieth birthday, following the path that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] took many years earlier. He sold [[Bag End]] to the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]]. Rumour suggested that Frodo had run out of money and had to go live with relatives in [[Buckland]]. Some others insisted that Frodo was only leaving because of some dark plot perpetrated by [[Gandalf]]. In truth, Frodo planned to go to [[Rivendell]], as he had discussed with Gandalf previously. Meanwhile, Gandalf had left, not even staying behind to say good-bye to Frodo. [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] were coming with Frodo, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]] was going ahead with [[Fatty Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] to prepare a house at [[Crickhollow]] for them.

On the way, the band of travelers heard the sound of horses. They thought Gandalf was joining them, so they hid in order to surprise him. Instead of Gandalf, a black rider on a black horse arrived. He sniffed the air as if sensing their presence and Frodo felt a sudden urge to put his [[The One Ring|Ring]] on. But the rider moved on. Samwise told Frodo that this very rider had been asking questions about Frodo. The travelers became suspicious and moved on, more cautious than before.

Later, they experienced another scare when another or the same rider came to them and began to crawl towards Frodo. Luckily a group of elves were coming down the road at that time and the black rider retreated to the other side of the lane. Frodo and the others met the group of elves. The Lord of the Elves, [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], asked the travellers to join him and his group for a night. After they reached a safe place and have their fill of food and drink, Frodo asked Gildor for news and advice. Gildor told him of the gathering darkness, the wars of men and the flight of the elves. He explained to Frodo that the [[Nazg√ªl|Black Riders]] were the servants of the [[Sauron|Enemy]] and that he had to be careful. He extended his friendship and that of is people to Frodo and his group. Sam was delighted, since he had always dreamed of being on an adventure with elves.
