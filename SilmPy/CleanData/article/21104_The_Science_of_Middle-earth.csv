}}'''''The Science of Middle-earth''''' (sometimes seen as ''The Science of Middle Earth'') is a book by biologist [[Henry Gee]] which seeks to use science and logic to help explain various phenomena in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]]. A revised edition was released as a Kindle book on [[13 December]] [[2012]].

==About==
From the publisher:

::"''The author explores just how elves might be able to see much further than humans, why Frodo's sword turns blue at the sight of evil orcs, how the rings of power do their thing, and just about every other conundrum or piece of 'elvish magic' that have puzzled and delighted Tolkien fans for years. Throughout, Gee makes the point that science, fantasy, and nature are really more similar than one might think. Gee writes in a popular tone and style, fully explaining all science concepts and convincingly demonstrating how Tolkien's world of fantasy makes sense in a very real - scientific - way.''"
