The '''Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''''', later known as '''Nomenclature of ''The Lord of the Rings''''' or simply '''Nomenclature''' is a collection of notes made by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] after the [[Max Schuchart|Dutch]] and [[Åke Ohlmarks|Swedish]] translations had come out.<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, pp. 750-781</ref> 

==Publication history==
The Guide was first published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].<ref name="ATC">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), "Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]])</ref> It was included in [[Open Court]]'s first hardcover edition and [[Del Rey Books]]' paperback, but was dropped from the second edition at the request of [[Tolkien Estate]], the legal owners of the text.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], "Foreword", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', Third Edition (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), pages vii-xi</ref> 

A new edition by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] – called ''Nomenclature'' – was published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]''.
==Differences between editions==
===General differences===
* Christopher Tolkien's edition is a reader's edition rather than the annotated facsimile edition of Hammond and Scull: short, stenographic sentences and abbreviations are written out in full, and it is generally written for a less linguistic audience. Hammond and Scull included a list of abbreviations, as well as extra notes within straight brackets. 
* Christopher Tolkien's edition follows his father's text in that it refers to the second, revised edition,<ref name="ATC"/> while Hammond and Scull also include references to their own [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]] in straight brackets.<ref name="RC"/>
* The first two sections have been renamed in Christopher Tolkien's edition: ''Names of Persons and Peoples'' and ''Place-names'' versus ''Persons, Peoples, Creatures'' and ''Places''. The name of the third section, ''Things'', is not changed.

===Smaller differences===
* '''Barrow-wight''': Hammond and Scull misspell the Dutch version, as well as its English translation: ''grafghest'' and "grave-ghast"<ref name="RC"/> rather than proper ''grafgeest''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Max Schuchart]] (translator), ''[[The Lord of the Rings|In de Ban van de Ring]]'', ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring|De Reisgenoten]]'', "[[Fog on the Barrow-downs|Mist op de Grafheuvels]]"</ref>

* '''Greyhame''': Christopher Tolkien refers to the [[Rohirric|language of Rohan]] as "Rohan",<ref name="ATC"/> Hammond and Scull as "Rohanese".<ref name="RC"/> It is the only occurrence of "Rohanese"; the rest of the Hammond and Scull-edition uses the word "Rohan". 
* '''Heathertoes''': Christopher Tolkien spells the suggested German translation as ''Heidezhen'',<ref name="ATC"/> Hammond and Scull as ''Heidezehn''.<ref name="RC"/> [[Margaret Carroux]] would eventually use the plural ''Heidezehen'', [[Wolfgang Krege]] singular ''Heidezeh''.<ref>"[http://ardapedia.herr-der-ringe-film.de/index.php/Der_Herr_der_Ringe:_Namensübersetzungen_-_Personen#H Der Herr der Ringe: Namensübersetzungen - Personen]", [[Ardapedia]]</ref>
