The '''Forest of Neldoreth''' was the [[Beeches|beech]]-forest that lay between the banks of the [[Esgalduin|Esgalduin River]] and the [[Mindeb|Mindeb River]] that formed the northern and lesser part of the Kingdom of [[Doriath]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  

==History==
It was in the Forest of Neldoreth that [[Lúthien]] was born and later these woods were part of the enclosure called the "[[Girdle of Melian]]".<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> It was also under the trees of Neldoreth that [[Beren]] first beheld Lúthien dancing in the moonlight.  Later, when [[Sauron]] had cast Beren into a pit and Lúthien resolved to rescue him, [[Thingol]] had her imprisoned in a house built high in the branches of the highest tree of the forest, called [[Hírilorn]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

When [[Treebeard]] was carrying [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to [[Wellinghall]] he chanted to them about walking in the woods of the [[First Age]].  He recalled coming to Neldoreth in Autumn and enjoying the gold and red and sighing leaves of ''Taur-na-neldor'' (an alternate name for the forest).<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
On an early draft map for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien indicated that ''Neldoreth'' was the name of the forest on the north-eastern shore of the [[Sea of Rhûn]]. This forest went unnamed in later maps.<ref>{{TI|MII}}, p. 307</ref> 

[[Treebeard]]'s home was also called the Forest of Neldoreth in an early draft.<ref>{{RS|New}}, p. 384</ref>
