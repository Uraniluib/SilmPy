'''Otho Sackville-Baggins''' ({{TA|2910}} - {{TA|3012|n}}, died aged 102) was the husband of [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] and the founder of the short-lived [[Sackville-Baggins Family]]. He was representative of the greedy and ill-mannered traits of his family.
__NOTOC__
==History==
Otho was the only child of [[Longo Baggins]] and [[Camellia Sackville]].<ref name="Baggins">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> Through his mother, he was the head of the [[Sackville Family]], so he adopted the double surname out of custom.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref> He married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] with whom he had a son named [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].

He was also second in line to patriarchy of the [[Baggins Family]], and would have been [[Bilbo Baggins]]' heir were it not for his adoption of his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. This did not sit well with Otho and his wife, as they both dearly wanted to live in [[Bag End]].<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Otho was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo had vanished in front of the crowd during the celebration, Otho and his wife departed in wrath. He did not live long enough to see Bag End as he died in {{SR|1412}}; it was six years later when Lobelia eventually did come into possession of Bag End, and moved in with her son.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Otho'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Otha''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
