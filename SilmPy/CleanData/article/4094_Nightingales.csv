'''Nightingales''' were small brown birds of [[thrushes|thrush]] kind, famous for their clear singing and for the fact that they would sing at night as well as during the day (hence their name).

The [[Maia]] [[Melian]] was said to always have nightingales about her, and she taught them their songs. It was the song of these birds that enchanted [[Elwë]], lord of the [[Teleri]], when he was wandering alone in [[Nan Elmoth]] and came upon Melian.<ref name="Thingol">{{S|Thingol}}</ref>
