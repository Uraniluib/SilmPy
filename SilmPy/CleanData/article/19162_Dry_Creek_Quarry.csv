'''Dry Creek Quarry''' is a quarry outside [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], owned by Allied Concrete. It formed the set of the [[Hornburg]] in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]. It was not destroyed; rather, it was rebuilt as a maze version of [[Minas Tirith]], to be used on [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]].
