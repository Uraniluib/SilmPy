'''Inglor Felagund''' was an older, rejected name for [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. It makes a relic appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in the form of "[[Gildor|Gildor '''Inglor'''ion]]".

==Finrod==
In earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], until the era of the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name "Finrod" was given to the character later known as [[Finarfin]]. [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] was at the time known as Inglor Felagund. 

The name however was survived in the patronym ''Inglorion'' and perhaps in the Quenya form ''[[Ingalaurë]]''. The character with the name Inglorion in ''The Lord the Rings'' [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], although a fellow Noldo, was  unrelated to Finrod and certainly not his son. Finrod, as seen in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', was unmarried and childless because his lover, Amarië of the Vanyar, did not follow him to Middle-earth.<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Inglor in the early appearances was interpreted as "heart-gold" ([[Sundocarmë|Root]]s [[IND]] and G-[[LOR]]). 

Although the name Inglor(ion) is not analyzed in the later works, there is a similarity to Finarfin's [[Amilessë|mother-name]], ''Ingalaurë''<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>. Therefore according to the more recent background, Inglor could be the [[sindarization|Sindarin interpretation]] of that name, having a new etymology and meaning ("Vanya-gold").
