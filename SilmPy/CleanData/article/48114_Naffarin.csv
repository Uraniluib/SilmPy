'''''Naffarin''''' is a language created in the 1910s by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Naffarin incorporated some of the latest stages of [[Nevbosh]]. This language was inspired by Latin and Spanish. 

In his lecture '[[A Secret Vice]]', Tolkien mentions one Naffarin sentence to illustrate, but there is no translation: ''O Naffarínos cutá vu navru cangor luttos ca vúna tiéranar, dana maga tíer ce vru encá vún' farta once ya merúta vúna maxt' amámen''.<ref>{{HM|MC}}, p. 141</ref> 

Based on the above phrase, [[Helge Fauskanger]] noted that Naffarin has several elements in style and structure that might resemble future [[Elvish]] (in [[1915]] Tolkien would start writing the [[Qenya Lexicon]]).
