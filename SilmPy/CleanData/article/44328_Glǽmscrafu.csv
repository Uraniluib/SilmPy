'''Glǽmscrafu''' (the [[Old English]] name for the [[Glittering Caves]]<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>) is a linguistic website authored by Benjamin Babut and Bertrand Bellet, hosted by Cédric Fockeu on JRRVF and launched in [[2006]]. It is dedicated especially to the [[Wikipedia:Phonoesthetics|phonoesthetics]] of [[Tolkien]]'s constructed [[languages]]. 

It provides authentic texts written by Tolkien in his constructed languages, [[Quenya]]/[[Qenya]], [[Sindarin]]/[[Noldorin]], [[Adunaic]], [[Khuzdul]] and others, with sound samples.

The database also provides historical excerpts and sound samples from real-life languages whose philology or phonotactics influenced Tolkien's languages or [[Legendarium]]. There are samples of [[Finnish]] (the main source of Quenya), [[Welsh]] (the main source of Sindarin), [[Old English]] (exemplified as the [[Rohan language]]), [[Old Norse]] (exemplified the names of the [[Longbeards]], including a sample of the ''[[Voluspa|"Catalogue of Dwarves"]]''), [[Gothic]] (including a sample of ''[[Bagmē Blōma]]'') and [[Latin]].

Since [[25 March]] [[2016]], the site contains "Glǽmscribe", a feature transriber of texts into [[Sarati]], [[Tengwar]], [[Gothic]] or [[Runes]]/[[Cirth]].
