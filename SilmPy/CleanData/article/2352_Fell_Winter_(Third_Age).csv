The '''Fell Winter''' ({{TA|2911}} – {{TA|2912|n}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>) was an extremely cold and long-lasting winter in [[Middle-earth]].

Like the earlier [[Long Winter]] ({{TA|2758}} – {{TA|2759|n}}), the Fell Winter began in November. This time [[Sauron]] was not able to launch a full attack, as the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] of a full century earlier had eliminated most of the [[Orcs]] in the north, and the [[Haradrim]] had been badly defeated in {{TA|2885|n}}.<ref name="TA"/>

The winter was also less harsh than the Long Winter, and snow and ice stopped in [[Eriador]] at the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]] River, and in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] in the middle of [[Mirkwood]]. Nevertheless there were severe problems, as food again ran short, and the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] were attacked by [[White Wolves]] which crossed the frozen [[Brandywine]] river.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> It was on this occasion that the [[Horn-call of Buckland]] had been sounded; it was not heard again until [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] invaded [[Buckland]] in {{TA|3018|n}}.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> [[Gandalf]] and the [[Rangers of the North]] had to provide food for the Hobbits to prevent them from dying of hunger.

In March when the winter ended great floods of meltwater rushed down [[Gwathló|Greyflood]], and the city of [[Tharbad]] was ruined and its bridge broken. The people of [[Enedwaith]] also suffered greatly as their lands were flooded.<ref name="TA"/>
