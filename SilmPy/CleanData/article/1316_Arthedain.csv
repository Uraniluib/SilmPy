{{Pronounce|Arthedain.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Arthedain''' was one of the three realms of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnedain of the North]] created from the fragmentation of the kingdom of [[Arnor]]. After the death of Arnor's King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], his sons divided the realm into the kingdoms of Arthedain, [[Rhudaur]] and [[Cardolan]].

==Description==
Arthedain lay primarily between the [[Lhûn]] and the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] in northwestern [[Eriador]]. However, it also claimed the land north of the [[East Road]] from the [[Brandywine Bridge]] to the [[Weather Hills]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> Notable features within Arthedain were the [[Hills of Evendim]], [[Lake Evendim]], [[North Downs]], [[Tower Hills]], [[Far Downs]], [[White Downs]], [[the Shire]], [[Annúminas]], and [[Fornost Erain]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
After the tenth king of Arnor, Eärendur, died in {{TA|861}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> dissensions between his sons fractured the realm. Arnor was divided into Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan. The line of [[Isildur]] was maintained in Arthedain, but in Rhudaur and Cardolan the line faded quickly. Arthedain retained [[Weathertop]] and [[Amon Sûl-stone|its]] ''[[Palantíri|Palantír]]'' as well as [[Annúminas-stone|two]] [[Elostirion-stone|others]], which led to contention between the three kingdoms.<ref name="Eriador"/>

When [[Malvegil]] of Arthedain became king in {{TA|1272|n}}<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> [[Orcs]] began to trouble the region.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> Around {{TA|1300}}, the [[Witch-king]] founded the kingdom of [[Angmar]] north of the [[Ettenmoors]], soon to become the foe of Arthedain.<ref name="TA"/>

After Malvegil, his son [[Argeleb I]] reclaimed lordship over all of Arnor since Rhudaur and Cardolan had no living descendants of Isildur.  Rhudaur refused this claim and allied with Angmar.<ref name="Eriador"/>  Argeleb I fell in battle with Rhudaur in {{TA|1356|n}}.<ref name="TA"/>  His son, [[Arveleg I]], avenged his father by retaking the Weather Hills, aided by [[Lindon]] and Cardolan.  However, a great host issued from Angmar in {{TA|1409}}, invading Arthedain and taking Weathertop. King Arveleg I was slain. Rhudaur was occupied by Angmar and Cardolan was ravaged.<ref name="Eriador"/>

In {{TA|1601|n}} two [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] brothers, [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]], crossed the Brandywine with many [[Hobbits]] and, with the permission of King [[Argeleb II]], established [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> The Hobbits and the remaining [[Men]] in Arthedain suffered losses in the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636|n}}.<ref name="TA"/>

In {{TA|1974|n}}<ref name="TA"/> the Witch-king invaded Arthedain, capturing Fornost and driving most of the few Dúnedain across the Lhûn. King [[Arvedui]] held out for awhile in the [[North Downs]] until he and his guard were driven north.<ref name="Eriador"/>  Although the realm of Angmar was crushed at the [[Battle of Fornost]] in {{TA|1975|n}},<ref name="TA"/> the realm of Arthedain also came to an end and its lands remained mostly empty (except for the Shire) and its people became [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]]; until the [[Reunited Kingdom|reestablishment]] of the northern kingdom under king [[Aragorn|Elessar]] at the end of the [[Third Age]].
