[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Shores of Faery.png|thumb|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] - "The Shores of Faery"]]'''Faerie''' was the lands of the [[Elves]] in [[Aman]] as known in [[Westron]] in the folklore of the [[Hobbits]].<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref> It is possible that it referred to what is known as [[Eldamar]] (translated as '[[Elvenhome]]', '[[Elvenland]]' or '[[Elvenesse]]'). 

[[Bilbo Baggins]]' poem ''[[Errantry]]'' mentions the lands of [[Aerie]] and Faerie; Elven paladins challenged the mariner character of the song.<ref>{{AB|Errantry}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
The idea of Faerie actually encapsulates a much more profound notion explored by Tolkien in his lecture and essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', where it represents a realm on the edge of human experience in which fantastical creatures dwell.

The name 'Faerie' belongs to an early period of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings, and is never seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but it does survive in a single usage in the earlier book ''[[The Hobbit]]'' where this high idea takes on a more concrete form, and there it relates specifically to the realms occupied by the Elves beyond the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>
