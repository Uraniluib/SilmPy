For those living in the [[Westlands]], the '''East''' refers to all unknown eastern lands. The [[Quenya]] name for the East is ''[[Rómen]]'', which is also the name of a [[Tengwar|letter]]. In [[Sindarin]] the East is called ''[[Rhûn]]''. 

==Geography==
Not much is known about the lands or peoples outside the Westlands. [[Cuiviénen]], the lake where the [[Elves]] [[awakening of the Elves|awoke]], was somewhere in the East of Middle-earth<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>. The eastern parts of the continent also featured two great mountain ranges, the [[Orocarni|Red]] and [[Yellow Mountains]]. [[Hildórien]], the origin of [[Men]], was also somewhere in the east.<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> Beyond these, the continent of [[Middle-earth]] ended on the shores of the [[East Sea]].

==Peoples==
The [[Avari]] remained in the East, and other Elves who abandoned the [[Great March]] to the West. Eventually some of the Avari would also migrate West.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 53</ref><ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 9</ref>

The [[Men]] living in the East were known as [[Easterlings]], being various tribes of [[Men of Darkness]], such as the [[Wainriders]], the [[Balchoth]] and the [[Variags]].

The East was also home to the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] clans of [[Ironfists]], [[Stiffbeards]], [[Blacklocks]] and [[Stonefoots]].<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref>

In the [[Second Age|Second]] or [[Third Age]]s the [[Blue Wizards]] went into the East, never to return<ref name="PMLast">{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-85</ref>. [[Saruman]] may have joined them before returning and occupying [[Isengard]]. During the [[Watchful Peace]], [[Sauron]] went to hiding in the East for 400 years and gathered the Easterlings to his service; the Blue Wizards failed to discover his eastern stronghold.<ref name="PMLast"/>

==Other notes==
As the general direction of the [[West]] was revered by the [[Gondorians]],<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref> conversely the East had evil connotations in some contexts as it where [[Mordor]] lay; the people of Gondor endured the east wind but do not ask it for tidings, because it came from the "[[Sauron|Evil in the East]]".<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>

Unlike the Elven maps, the maps drawn by the Dwarves displayed the East on the top, as can be seen on the [[Thrór's Map]].
