'''In Western Lands''' is a song that was sung by [[Sam Gamgee]] on [[14 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].  Sam had just climbed to the top of the stairs in the tower but could not find [[Frodo Baggins]]; he felt he was not actually at top of the tower but he was unable to discover any way that led upwards. Defeated, Sam bowed his head. Suddenly, to his surprise, he began to sing.  At first he only recited childish tunes and rhymes, but then a new song arose in him:

==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic;margin-left:20px;">
In western lands beneath the Sun
the flowers may rise in Spring,
the trees may bud, the waters run,
the merry [[finches]] sing.
Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night
and swaying beeches bear
the Elven-stars as jewels white
amid their branching hair.
 
Though here at journey's end I lie
in darkness buried deep,
beyond all towers strong and high,
beyond all mountains steep,
above all shadows rides the Sun
and Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
nor bid the Stars farewell.
</poem>
 
Sam began to sing the line "Beyond all towers strong and high" again but stopped abruptly when he thought he could hear a faint answering voice.  The voice stopped but then he heard the footsteps of [[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga]] approaching.  Sam's voice, obviously not that of an [[Elves|Elf]], had attracted the [[Orcs|orc]], who came to shut Frodo up.  Snaga brought in a ladder which enabled him to reach the final chamber above, soon to be followed by Sam.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>
