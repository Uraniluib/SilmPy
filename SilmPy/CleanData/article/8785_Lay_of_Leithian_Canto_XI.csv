{{lolcantos}}
This [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Canto]] starts with a description of [[Dor-na-Fauglith]] ("Land under Choking Ash"), but changes its name to "Land of Thirst".  [[Beren]] gazes across the plain and sees afar [[Thangorodrim]]. He gives [[Curufin]]'s horse leave to depart; the last [[horse]] to stand upon that plain. Then he sings his [[Beren's Song|Song of Farewell]], "grim-hearted, bitter, fierce and fey."  But as he ends and begins to stride down toward death, [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] comes. Beren wonders and asks where [[Huan]] is, but Lúthien knows not.

Finally Huan comes, and brings forth two bodies and lays them at their feet: that of [[Werewolves|wolf]] [[Draugluin]], and that of a [[vampire]] [[Thuringwethil]]. Beren asks why he brought them; were they just trophies of their victory over [[Thû]]? But Huan spoke for only the second time in his life, and declares that they must don the bodies as raiments and sneak into [[Angband]]. With [[Elves|Elvish]] magic Lúthien causes them to take on the shape of the bodies, and then they stumble across the thirty desert of Dor-na-Fauglith.  At last they reach the gates and towers of Angband, and enter the roots of Thangorodrim.
