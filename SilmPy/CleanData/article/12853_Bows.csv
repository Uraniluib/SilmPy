'''Bows''' were a common weapon in [[Arda]]. All peoples, Good and Evil, were known to have used them, most notable of them being the [[Elves]], the [[Númenóreans]], [[Rohirrim]], [[Orcs]] and even [[Hobbits]].<ref>[[Anthony Burdge]], [[Jessica Burke]], "Weapons, Named"; in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]])</ref>

==Overview==
Bows varied in shape, size and material. While [[Elves|elven]] flawless bows were made from wood, [[Númenóreans|Numenorean]] and [[Orcs|Orcish]] bows were made of steel, forged in armories.{{fact}} It is said in a poem that [[Eärendil]] wielded a bow "made of dragon-horn".<ref>{{FR|Earendil}}</ref>
==Bows by Faction==
*'''[[Elves]]''' of [[Doriath]] and [[Lothlórien]] used longbows which were, as their name suggests, longer bows which could shoot farther and higher than any other types of bows. Elves were the first race to develop and master the use of bows, and later passed their knowledge to [[Men]].

*'''[[Númenóreans]]''' used a type of bow called the steelbow, which was hollow and made of steel, as its name implies. It was much feared by their enemies.<ref>{{HM|UT}}</ref>

* The '''[[Gondorians|Gondorian]]''' army contains units of archers who use a longbow. The bows are made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28 inches long with four-inch steel tips. They're accurate up to 200 yards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds the arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers. Bows were also the primary weapon of the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].<ref>{{HM|TT}}</ref>

*'''[[Rohirrim]]''' archers used shortbows, possibly because they fought mounted on horses. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by other [[Men]], having a range of only 125 yards.

*'''[[Hobbits]]''' also used bows. Hobbit archers fought for [[Arnor]] in the [[Battle of Fornost]]<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>, and also participated in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

*'''[[Orcs]]''' used bows for hunting, as well as weapons of war. Orcish bows were made of steel, and thus were likely heavy and difficult to use. Bows and crossbows were used as a weapon by the fierce [[Uruk-hai]] in the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]].

==Notable bowmen==
* [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] who bore [[Belthronding]]
* [[Bard]] who slew the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] with his [[Black Arrow]]
* [[Legolas]], a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]

==In other languages==
*[[Quenya]]: ''quinga''
*[[Sindarin]]/[[Noldorin]]: ''ping'', ''cú''
*[[Nandorin]]: ''cogn''

The forms ''quinga'', ''ping'' are cognates deriving from the [[Primitive Quendian]] ''kwingā''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry KWIG (in that source the first word is spelled ''qinga'', and the second is [[Noldorin]].</ref>

The form ''cogn'', is derived from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''kuȝnā'', itself representing the [[root]] KUȜ.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry KUȜ, p. 365</ref>

==Inspirations==
It is possible Tolkien's fascination with bows came from Red Indian stories:
{{quote|Red Indians were better: there were bows and arrows (I had and have a wholly unsatisfied desire to shoot well with a bow)|[[On Fairy-Stories]]}}
{{quote|But he [Tolkien] liked Red Indian stories and longed to shoot with a bow and arrow.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''[[2001]]-[[2003]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Bows, just like all weapons from the films, were designed during the pre-production by artists like [[Warren Mahy]], with aid from [[Alan Lee]] and [[John Howe]]. The majorty of them were hand-crafted by [[Weta Workshop]] employees.<ref>''[[Weta Workshop (featurette)]]''</ref>
