==Excerpt==

Dear Mr. Snapp, Thank you very much for your letter. It gave me great pleasure to learn of the interest of undergraduates at Yale in my in my work.

With regard to your proposition: I do not deal with matters of that kind myself. They are in the hands of my publishers: Messrs. Allen & Unwin, Ltd., 40 Museum Street, London, W.C.1. I am forwarding a copy of your letter to them, and I expect you will hear from them in due course. With best wishes, Yours Sincerely, J.R.R. Tolkien
