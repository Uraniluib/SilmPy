'''Sharkey''' was a nickname for [[Saruman]] given by his servants and soldiers in [[Isengard]] and later used in [[the Shire]] during the last stages of the [[War of the Ring]]. 
==Etymology==
The nickname attempts to translate into English the [[Westron]] word. The name is not given but it was actually based on [[orkish]] ''[[sharkû]]'' 'old man'. 

The word therefore is an Anglicization of ''sharkû'' and the -ey is intended to be the English "diminutive and quasi-affectionate ending -ey".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 763</ref> A Westron ending of such function is not known.
