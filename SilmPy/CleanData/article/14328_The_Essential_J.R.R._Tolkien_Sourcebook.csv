Breaking new ground, this is a must have for any [[J.R.R.

It is a comprehensive reference work long awaited by the millions of Tolkien fans throughout the world who have bought 100 million copies of his books, in more than 40 languages. This book will also be especially appealing to the millions of new fans-moviegoers-turned-readers-who have rushed from theaters to bookstores worldwide to seek more information about Tolkien and his work. Profusely illustrated, it features one hundred photographs and drawings from noted fantasy artist [[Colleen Doran]], plus art portfolios by Tolkien [[:Category:Calendars|calendar]] artist [[Tim Kirk]], and cover artist [[Donato Giancola]]. Chock-full of sidebars, quotes, and short interviews, this guide to Middle-earth and beyond will be an indispensable addition to any Tolkien collection.
