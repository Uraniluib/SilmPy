[[File:David T. Wenzel - Raft-elves.jpg|thumb|A raft-elf portrayed by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]
The '''raft-elves''' brought goods on the [[Forest River]] between the [[Woodland Realm]] and [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]]. The goods were stored in barrels which were tied together and then poled or rowed up the river. Sometimes they also used flat boats, on which the goods were loaded.<ref name=H9>{{H|9}}</ref>

The term "raft-elves" is mentioned only once,<ref name=H9/> so likely these elves pertained to [[Thranduil]]'s [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves of Mirkwood]].
