The '''Quest of the Ring''', also known as the '''Quest for Mount Doom''', was the quest taken by the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to destroy [[the One Ring]] of [[Sauron]] to rid the evil from [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Third Age]]. It forms the center of the story of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==History==
Though its necessity was obvious to many beforehand, the Quest was initiated during the [[Council of Elrond]]. [[Elrond]] appointed eight members to accompany the [[Ring-bearers|ring-bearer]] [[Frodo Baggins]] on his difficult journey: [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], [[Boromir]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Merry and Pippin were not chosen, but went on their own consent. After spending the winter in [[Rivendell]], the Company set off on the arduous journey that lay ahead.

They set off for [[Eregion]], and attempted to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] at the [[Redhorn Pass]]. Stopped by snow, the Fellowship sought a different path: the long dark of [[Moria]]. There, [[Gandalf]] fell in battle with [[Durin's Bane]].

The remaining eight members of the Fellowship, now led by Aragorn, entered [[Lothl√≥rien]], where they spent a month in the care of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. They departed by swift Elven boats, and headed South over the [[Anduin]]. 

And so they came to [[Nen Hithoel]] and the [[Emyn Muil]], where Boromir was slain, and the Fellowship was broken. Frodo and Sam crossed the river to the east and, after much toil, escaped the hills. With the help of [[Gollum]], they crossed the [[Dead Marshes]], and came in sight of the [[Black Gate]]. Unable to enter [[Mordor]], they went to the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]], but were divided by the treachery of Gollum. Frodo was stung by [[Shelob]] and taken prisoner. At the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], he was stripped of his affects, but the Sam managed to free him. The Ring had, at this stage, been taken by Sam, for safe-keeping. 

Frodo and Sam continued their way, via the [[Carach Angren|Isenmouthe]], to [[Mount Doom]]. Gollum appeared one last time to seize the [[The One Ring|Ring]], but fell with it to his death into the fiery chasm of Mount Doom.
