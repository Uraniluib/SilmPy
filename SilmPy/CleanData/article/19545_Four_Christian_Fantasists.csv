'''''Four Christian Fantasists: A Study of the Fantastic Writings of George MacDonald, Charles Williams, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien''''' is the third book of Walking Tree's ''[[Cormarë Series]]''. Unlike most other volumes, it is not a collection of essays, but a single work by [[Richard Sturch]]. 

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it has long been recognized, was shaped and undergirded by his Christian beliefs. But he was not the only writer of fantasy to have a close relationship between his faith and his fiction. This book is a study of such relationships in four writers: Tolkien himself, his friends [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams]], and, from an earlier generation, George MacDonald. It seeks to look at their use of other worlds and other beings; at their attitudes towards 'escapism'; at the presence of symbolism and myth in their writings; at the themes and ideas they had in common; and at the extent to which their fiction has a value for Christian apologetics.}}
