'''Aelin-uial''', or the '''Meres of Twilight''', was a marshy confluence of the river [[Aros]] into [[Sirion]], south of [[Doriath]].

==Location==
The Aelin-uial was the maze of lakes and [[Fens of Sirion|fens]] formed where the river [[Aros]] met the [[Sirion]], before it fell beneath the [[Andram]].<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref> These were lands heavy with enchantment from the [[Girdle of Melian]] guarding [[Doriath]] to the north of the Aelin-uial, and also from the power of [[Ulmo]] the [[Valar|Vala]], which was very strong in this area.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

At the southernmost end of the Aelin-uial, the waters of Sirion met once more at the [[Falls of Sirion]].<ref name="Map"/>
==History==
The Aelin-uial was under the control of Doriath. [[Thingol]]'s [[Marchwardens]] kept secret ferries among the reeds, which they could use to cross in between Sirion's eastern and western banks unseen by anyone.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

It was here that [[Turgon]] and [[Finrod]] slept and Ulmo put into their dreams the idea of building their hidden strongholds located at [[Gondolin]] and [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>  It was also in the meres that the Elves who guarded the western marches of Doriath found [[Húrin]], whom they then brought before King [[Thingol]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

==Etymology==

Aelin-uial is a [[Sindarin]] name, composed of ''aelin'' "meres", plural of ''[[ael]]'' + ''[[uial]]'' "twilight".

A variant name used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was '''''Umboth Muilin''''' (also spelt ''Umboth-muilin'' and ''Umboth-Muilin''), which translates to "Pools of Twilight".<ref>{{HM|IX}}, pp. 451-2</ref> [[Helge Fauskanger]] has noted that the [[Noldorin]] name ''Oelinuial'' ("Pools of Twilight"; variant forms ''Elinuial'' and ''Eilinuial''<ref>[[David Salo]], "[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/2068 AE and OE (message 2028)]" at [[Elfling]]</ref>), of the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], became ''Aelin-uial'' in the published [[The Silmarillion|''Silmarillion'']].<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/index/indexs.htm Index to the Etymologies - Explanation]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 18 September 2011)</ref>

Yet another, early form, was the [[Gnomish]] name ''Hithliniath'' ("Pools of Mist"; which was amended to ''Umboth Muilin'', itself amended to ''Aelinuial'').<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 194 (§111)</ref>
