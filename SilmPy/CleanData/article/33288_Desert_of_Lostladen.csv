__NOTOC__
The '''Desert of Lostladen''' was a region between [[Nurn]] and [[Near Harad]], just south of [[Mordor]]. Nothing else is known of the desert, and the name is only found pencilled on a map made for ''[[The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, pp. 413, 426 (note 35), 435, 439 (note 4)</ref>
==Etymology==

In an early sketch of the chapter "[[The Last Debate]]", the region was called the Lothland desert. [[Christopher Tolkien]] has therefore noted that the name ''Lostladen'' is likely related to the names ''[[Lothlann]]''/''Lothland'' found in the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] (cf. [[Sundocarme|roots]] [[LAD]] and [[LUS]]).<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, p. 426</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 367, 370</ref>
