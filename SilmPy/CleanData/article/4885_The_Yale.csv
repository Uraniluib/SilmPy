The '''Lowlands of the Yale''' or just '''The Yale''' was a region of the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]] between the [[Bridgefields]] and the [[Marish]]. The road from [[Tuckborough]] emerged from the [[Woody End]] and descended into the Yale, on its way to join the [[Causeway]] at [[Stock]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref><ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

The Yale was of old the home of the [[Boffin Family|Boffins]].<ref>{{App|Boffin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[David Salo]] has suggested that Yale represents an [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Geal'', from [[Welsh]] ''[[Wikipedia:I창l|i창l]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref> This fits right in with Tolkien's comment to the Dutch Translator, [[Max Schuchart]], that there were "'[[Celtic]]' elements in [[Buckland]] and [[Eastfarthing|East-farthing]] names."<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 93</ref>

''Yale'' is of course a well known English surname derived from a [[Welsh]] place name.<ref name="Mathomium">[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', pp. 42-47</ref>  The modern meaning is "fertile upland", based on the location of the best known ''Yale'', the [[wikipedia:commote|commote]] of [[Wikipedia:I창l|I창l]] in Powys, the traditional home of the kings of Powys.<ref name="Mathomium"/>
