==Card text==

'''''Unique.''''' During the movement/hazard phase, the number of cards that opponent draws based on Alatar's company's movement is reduced by one. If in a haven when a hazard creature is played on another company, he may join that company and face one of the hazard creature's strikes; he must tap and make a corruption check immediately following the attack.
