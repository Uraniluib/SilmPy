The ancient '''Grey Mountains''' were a series of mountains which continue the line of the [[Blue Mountains]] as the western edge of [[Endor]], but on the [[Dark Land|Southlands]] of the continent.  Their position mirrors symmetrically the [[Yellow Mountains]] in the east.  This range was created when the [[Valar]] thrust [[Middle-earth]] eastward to give more protection to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{SM|5b}} p. 239</ref>

Since no maps of the entire world exist after the [[First Age]], it is unknown if this mountain line still existed later. In any case they do not appear in the stories.
