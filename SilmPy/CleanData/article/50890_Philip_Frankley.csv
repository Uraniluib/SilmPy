'''Philip Frankley''' (born in [[1932]]) was a member of the [[Notion Club]].

== History ==
Frankley was a poet, at one time well-known as a leader of the Queer Metre movement. He is said to have suffered from ''"horror borealis"'' - intolerance of all things Northern or Germanic, but nonetheless was a close friend of [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham|Lowdham]] whose chief interest lay in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language and history.<ref>{{SD|2b}}</ref>

According to [[Nicholas Guildford|Guildford]] he regards any knowledge of his own language at any period before the [[wikipedia:Battle of Bosworth Field|Battle of Bosworth]] as a misdemeanour.<ref>{{SD|2c}}, "Night 61"</ref>

During one of the meetings of The Notion Club, he recited the poem ''[[Imram]] (The Death of [[Saint Brendan]])'' before the other members. He said that it came to him, more or less complete, in his dream.<ref>{{SD|2d}}, "Night 69"</ref>
