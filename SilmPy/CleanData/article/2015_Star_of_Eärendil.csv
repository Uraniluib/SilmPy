The '''Star of Eärendil''' was the shining light of the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] rescued from [[Angband]] by [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]], and carried into the skies by their descendant [[Eärendil]] aboard his vessel [[Vingilot]]. As it first rose in the [[Aman|West]], it was recognised by the [[Noldor|Elf]]-lord [[Maedhros]] as the jewel of his [[Fëanor|father]] that he had sought for so long, now placed out of his reach beyond the [[Circles of the World]]. 

It was Eärendil and the light of his star that led the [[Edain]] to [[Númenor]] in the early [[Second Age]], and at that time the light of the Star was so brilliant that it hid all the other stars in the sky. From its guiding light came the [[Númenóreans]]' name for their land, [[Elenna]], meaning "Starwards". 

The light of Eärendil's Star played a crucial role much later in history, as well. It was light from this star that was gathered in [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], his gift from [[Galadriel]], which helped him survive his journey into [[Mordor]]. Even today the star still shines — the story of Eärendil and his Silmaril was the Elvish account of the "star" we know today as the planet Venus.
