'''The Shire''' was a region in [[Eriador]] inhabited by [[Hobbits]].

==Geography==
The Shire is described as a small but beautiful and fruitful land, beloved by its inhabitants. The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the Shire, but did not proceed with industrialisation. Various supplies could be found in the Shire, including cereals, fruit, wood and [[pipe-weed]] (a favourite treat of Hobbits).

The Shire was quite densely populated in parts with many villages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. There were green, rolling hills and freshly tilled earth, along with gardens and flower boxes on window sills.

Thanks to the protective presence of the [[Rangers of the North]] in the lands of the former Arnor, the Shire for centuries ignored the wide world outside, despite being traversed by the [[East Road]].

From the west to the east, the Shire originally measured 40 leagues (120 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles) from the [[Far Downs]] to the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. From the north to the south, it measured 50 leagues (150 Númenórean miles) from the northern moors to the marshes in the south.<ref name="FRHobbits"/> The total area of the shire must have extended roughly about 20,000 square miles.<ref group="note">[[Robert Foster]] estimates the total area of the Shire to be "about 18,000 square miles"; [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] has calculated a larger figure, about 21,400 square miles. See: {{HM|Guide}}, entry "Shire" and {{HM|AME}}, revised edn (London: HarperCollins, 1991), p. 69</ref>

In {{SR|1452}}, [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] gave the [[Westmarch]] to the [[Shire-hobbits]] as a gift. This extended the western boundaries of the Shire to the [[Tower Hills]].<ref name="AppB5"/> [[Buckland]], to the east of the Brandywine, remained an independent region occupied by [[Hobbits]].

==History==
<!--"See also" in Eriador#Foundation of the Shire links here-->
The Shire was a fertile and well-tilled part of [[Arnor]], but deserted during the waning days of the Kingdom when it was known as the splinter-realm of [[Arthedain]]; it had been the hunting grounds of the [[King of Arnor]]. The [[Hobbits]] (who lived in [[Dunland]] and parts of depopulated [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]) got official permission from King [[Argeleb II]] at Norbury ([[Fornost]]) to settle the lands. This was finally done in [[Third Age 1601]] (Year 1 in Shire Reckoning) by Hobbits from [[Bree]], led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]].

By 30 years later, almost all of the Hobbits of Middle-earth could be found in the Shire. The [[Shire-hobbits]] considered themselves as subjects of the [[Kings of Arthedain|King]], at least nominally, considering the isolation of their country. Nevertheless the Hobbits sent some support troops to the great battles Arnor fought against [[Angmar]]. After the fall of Arnor, the Shire remained a minor but independent political unit and the title of [[Thain]] was established to fill the absence of a Kingship.

Its small size, relative lack of importance, and brave and resilient Hobbit population made it too modest an objective for conquest. More important was that the Shire was guarded and protected by the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North]] (and [[Gandalf]]), who watched the borders and kept out intruders. The only strangers to enter the Shire were the [[Dwarves]] travelling on the [[East Road]] that ran through the Shire to and from their mines in the [[Blue Mountains]], and the occasional [[Elves]] on their way to the [[Emyn Beraid]] or the [[Grey Havens]].

In {{TA|2340}} the [[Oldbucks]] of the [[Marish]] crossed the [[Brandywine]] because of overpopulation and founded [[Buckland]].

However Shire faced its adversities since it was inside the range of the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}}, and [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Goblins]] from [[Mount Gram]] invaded the Shire until they were driven out after the [[Battle of Greenfields]] ({{TA|2747}}). The Shire also suffered because of the [[Long Winter]] ({{TA|2758}}) soon followed by the [[Days of Dearth]] ({{TA|2760}}) and the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] ({{TA|2911}}) when [[White Wolves]] entered the Shire.

During the [[War of the Ring]] the Shire was first visited by the Nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] and then, while the Rangers were off to the War, the Shire was defenceless. It was captured by [[Saruman]] and [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] who lead evil [[Men]]. It was liberated with the help of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] after the end of the War through their victory at the [[Battle of Bywater]].

But the damage which Saruman caused by forced industrialisation was undone by the Hobbits' efforts. The Shire was restored with soil from [[Lothlórien]], given to Sam by [[Galadriel]]. {{TA|3021}} was considered to be the most productive and prosperous year in their history.

With [[Aragorn]]'s return as the King of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], the Shire became in {{FoA|6}} a Free Land, protected enclave inside the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. He is known to have issued an order that forbade the entrance of full-sized [[Men]] into the Shire. In {{FoA|31}} King Aragorn granted Buckland officially as a part of the Shire named [[Eastmarch]], and also extended the land westwards to [[Emyn Beraid]]; this land was named [[Westmarch]].

==Administration==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - The Shire.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Shire in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]Initially, The Shire was a part of Arthedain. The Hobbits considered themselves as subjects of the King and only after the fall of Arnor, the Shire became an independent political unit led by the '''[[Thain]]''' from ''[[Tuckborough]]'' who was the head of the important [[Took Family|Took clan]]. While nominally the Thain ruled over the four [[Farthings]], in practice authority was so decentralised that the title was seen as more of a formality and ceremonial.

Official of the Shire was the '''[[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]]''' of [[Michel Delving]] in the [[White Downs]] (by extension seen as the mayor of the Shire). The Mayor's chief duties were serving as postmaster of the Shire's [[Messenger Service]], charging the [[Watch]] and presiding at fairs

Finally, the '''[[Master of Buckland]]''' at ''[[Bucklebury]]'' controlled [[Buckland]].

The sole law enforcement officials in the Shire were the [[Shirriffs]]. Their job was to protect the Shire from trespassers more than anything. There were three in each Farthing, and were distinguished from "civilians" by a feather worn in their caps. The [[Bounders]] were the land's border-guard, charged with turning back unwanted people or beasts, and their number varied according to need.

The Shire was originally divided in four Farthings (''[[Northfarthing]]'', ''[[Southfarthing]]'', ''[[Eastfarthing]]'', and ''[[Westfarthing]]''), but [[Buckland]] and later the [[Westmarch]] were added to it. Within the Farthings there are some smaller, unofficial divisions such as family lands: the [[Took Family|Tooks]] nearly all live in or near [[Tuckborough]] in [[Tookland]], for instance. In many cases a Hobbit's last name indicates where their family came from: [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s last name derives from ''[[Gamwich]]'', where the family originated. Outside the Farthings, Buckland itself was named for the [[Oldbucks]] (later [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]]). See further ''[[Regions of the Shire]]''.

==Etymology==
A "shire" ([[Old English]] ''scír'') is an organised region with a "[[Michel Delving|county-town]]".<ref name="Nomen"/>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that in English, OE ''scír'' replaced the Germanic word for district ''gē'' (cognate, German ''Gau'', "valley, district") and in English was reduced to an element for a few old place-names, like [[wikipedia:Surrey|Surrey]] (from ''Suðer-ge'' "southern district").<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref>

==Inspiration==
{{quote|Though a Tolkien by name, I am a Suffield by tastes, talents, and upbringing, and '''any comer of that county [Worcestershire] (however fair or squalid) is in an indefinable way 'home' to me, as no other part of the world is.'''|[[Letter 44]]}}
On Tolkien's maps, the Shire is located at about the same position as England is on modern European maps and has been cited as an example of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_England#Deep_England Deep England] ideology (though, of course, England is on an island while the Shire is inside the continent). Throughout the narrative, Tolkien also implies numerous points of similarity between the two, such as weather, agriculture and dialect. One can also see England as Tolkien's source of inspiration for the Shire in its very name.

According to [[Paula Marmor]], the hobbit brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] names are related to horses, parallel to [[Wikipedia:Hengest|Hengest]] and [[Wikipedia:Horsa|Horsa]], legendary leaders who brought the Saxons to Britain. Hengest was the founder of [[Wikipedia:Kent|Kent]] whose geography is similar to the Shire (North Downs above, hills to the west, water to the east and marshes to the southeast)<ref>''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', An etymological excursion among the Shire Folk</ref>.

The industrialisation of the Shire was based on Tolkien's witnessing of the extension of the Industrial Revolution to rural Warwickshire during his youth, and especially the deleterious consequences thereof. The rebellion of the hobbits and the restoration of the pre-industrial Shire may be interpreted as a prescription of voluntary simplicity as a remedy to the problems of modern society.
