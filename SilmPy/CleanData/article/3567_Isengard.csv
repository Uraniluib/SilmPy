'''Isengard''' ("Iron Fortress", '''Angrenost''' in [[Sindarin]]<ref name="SIndex"/>) was a great fortress located within a valley at the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains]] near the [[Gap of Rohan]]. In the centre of the [[Ring of Isengard]] stood the stone tower of [[Orthanc]].<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

==Description==
The fortress of Isengard was located in a valley at the southern tip of the [[Misty Mountains]]; the [[Ring of Isengard]] was a great wall of stone that ran out from the mountain-side and then back again. The only entrance to Isengard was found delved into the southern wall of Isengard. One entering Isengard would pass through its only gate, travel down the long tunnel and pass through the iron doors to come to the plain of Isengard. In the centre of the plain, half a mile from the gate, stood the looming tower of [[Orthanc]]. For most of its history the lands of Isengard were green and a river ran from the mountains to form a lake. However after the treason of Saruman all green things that grew were removed and the river was dammed. The inner-ring was riddled with houses which cut into the walls. About the plain great shafts had been dug deep and many stone-flags paved the roads of the surface.<ref name="TTFlotsam"/><ref name="TTRoad"/>

{{blockquote|A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="TTRoad">{{TT|Road}}</ref>}}

==History==
===Second Age===
[[File:Rob Alexander - Isengard.jpg|thumb|[[Rob Alexander]] - ''Isengard'']]
It is unknown exactly when Isengard was first established. However it must have been built between {{SA|3320}}, the year in which the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] were established, and {{SA|3430}}, the year in which the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was formed.<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref> The [[Ring of Isengard]], and the tower of [[Orthanc]] therein, were built by the [[Dúnedain]], the Exiles of [[Númenor]], as a fortress on the north-western tip of Gondor. Within Orthanc was placed one of the seven seeing stones, the ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name="SV"/> This stone would be later referred to as the [[Orthanc-stone]].<ref name="TTP">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>

===Third Age===
[[Calenardhon]], a region never densely populated, suffered greatly at the hands of the {{TA|1636}} [[Great Plague]]. [[Orthanc]] was thus closed and its keys were sent to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="UTP">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> The fortress of Isengard, however, remained manned by a small garrison led by a hereditary Gondorian chieftain. This company grew more secretive as time progressed; its chieftain became known as the "[[Lord of Isengard]]" and they were believed to meddle in dark [[magic]] by the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name="UTIsen"/>

The attention of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] turned eastwards and their emissaries to Isengard eventually ceased completely. In their neglect they (and the Rohirrim) did not realise that the line of Gondorian chieftains had failed. The people had long intermingled with the [[Dunlendings]] and became more friendly to them than to the 'wild Northmen'. Dunlendings were allowed to settle in and around Isengard. They seized control of the fortress and killed any of the ancient Isengard guards who were unwilling to merge with them. During the reign of King [[Déor]] they became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Déor could not besiege the fortress and [[Egalmoth]], the Steward of Gondor, was unable to send help. Instead Déor kept a strong force of riders in the north of the [[Westfold]].<ref name="UTIsen"/> The occupation lasted through the reign of King [[Gram]].<ref name="AppA2"/>

In {{TA|2758}}, [[Wulf]] led the Dundlendings into a great invasion of [[Rohan]]. Despite impressive victories, they were eventually defeated by the Rohirrim. The Dundlendings who occupied Isengard suffered considerably in the [[Long Winter]]. They capitulated and were driven out by [[Fréaláf]] (soon to be the new king of Rohan) near the end of {{TA|2759}}.<ref name="AppA2">{{App|A2}}</ref><ref name="UTIsen"/>

====Saruman's domain====
When [[Saruman]] returned from his travels into the east of [[Middle-earth]], he offered to make Isengard his home and to command the defences of the West. This was welcomed by King [[Fréaláf]] of [[Rohan]] and Steward [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] of [[Gondor]] alike. In {{TA|2759}},<ref name="AppStewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> Saruman was given the keys of Orthanc.<ref name="SV"/> The valley in which Isengard resided soon became known as "[[Nan Curunír]]", the "Valley of Saruman" or the "Wizard's Vale".<ref name="TTTreebeard">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref><ref name="TTRoad">{{TT|Road}}</ref>

In {{TA|2851}}, the [[White Council]] met and [[Saruman]] overruled [[Gandalf]] when he urged an attack on [[Dol Guldur]]. It soon became clear that Saruman desired to possess [[the One Ring]] himself.<ref name="AppTA">{{App|TA}}</ref> In {{TA|2953}}<ref group="note">''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry "Isengard" incorrectly gives the date {{TA|2963}}.</ref>, following the last meeting of the [[White Council]], Saruman took Isengard for his own and fortified it.<ref name="AppTA"/> As Lord of Isengard, Saruman began to bring trouble to Rohan by aiding its enemies.<ref name="AppMark">{{App|Mark}}</ref> Saruman's corruption was complete when, in ''circa'' {{TA|3000}}, he used the [[Orthanc-stone|''palantír'' of Orthanc]] and was enticed by [[Sauron]].<ref name="AppTA"/>

On [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard.<ref name="AppGreat">{{App|Great}}</ref> Saruman revealed his true colours and demanded that Gandalf submit to him and Sauron. He refused and was imprisoned in [[Orthanc]]. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Isengard had been transformed; in place of trees and grass were pits and forges, and Saruman was gathering an army of [[orcs]] and [[wolves]].<ref name="FRCouncil">{{FR|Council}}</ref> On [[18 September]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf was borne away by [[Gwaihir]] the [[eagles|eagle]].<ref name="AppGreat"/>

Believing that Saruman knew the location of [[the One Ring]], Sauron sent the [[Nazgûl]] to Isengard. The [[Witch-king]] arrived at the gate of Isengard two days after Gandalf's escape (or, according to a different account, on the very day of his escape). But the Lord of Morgul and his company did not have the strength to assault the Ring of Isengard. He departed after Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring.<ref name="UTHunt">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

Isengard became Saruman's base of operations during the [[War of the Ring]]. His war with [[Rohan]] began on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}}, with the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. The forces of Isengard were victorious and Saruman's main objective, the killing of [[Théodred]] (son of King [[Théoden]]), was achieved. With another victory at the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on [[2 March]], the forces of Isengard won passage into the plains of Rohan and marched towards defeat at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] (on [[3 March]]).<ref name="AppGreat"/><ref name="UTIsen"/>

On 2 March, the [[Battle of Isengard]] began when the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] began their attack.<ref name="AppGreat"/> They overran the orcs and men therein, but were unable to assail the tower of Orthanc.<ref name="TTFlotsam"/>

On [[5 March]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], now the "doorwardens" of Isengard, welcomed [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].<ref name="TTRoad"/> They parleyed with Saruman, but he refused to co-operate.<ref name="TTVoice">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>

On [[22 August]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name="AppB3">{{App|B3}}</ref> Treebeard, now in command of Isengard,<ref name="TTRoad"/> allowed Saruman and [[Gríma]] to depart from what remained of the fortress. Before they went, they handed over the keys of Orthanc. This Treebeard told to Gandalf and company when they travelled through Isengard on their journey home.<ref name="RKPartings">{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

====The Treegarth of Orthanc and the Fourth Age====
{{main|Treegarth of Orthanc}}
Following the [[Battle of Isengard]], the [[Ents]] destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]] and filled the land with gardens of orchards and trees. A stream ran into a small clear lake, in the middle of which stood the black-stone tower of [[Orthanc]]. Whilst the Treegarth of Orthanc became part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Ents complete self-governance of what was formerly Isengard.<ref name="RKPartings"/>

==Etymology==
{{Transcribed|Tengwar Angrenost.png|Angrenost|Tengwar, Sindarin mode}}
''Isengard'' means "Iron-courd" in [[Old English]] (see also [[Isen]]): "''It was so called because of the great hardness of the stone in that place and especially in the central tower of Orthanc.''"<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref>

''Isen'' is an old English variant form of iron; and ''gard'' a Germanic word meaning 'enclosure (round a dwelling)' which appears in English ''garth/yard'' or Old Norse ''Asgard, Midgard'' etc.<ref name="Nomen"/>

It is used here to show an archaic [[Westron]] name of the place, translation of [[Sindarin]] ''[[Angrenost]]''.<ref name="Nomen"/>
