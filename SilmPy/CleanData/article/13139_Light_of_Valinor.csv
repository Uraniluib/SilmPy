The '''Light of Valinor''' was a term that referred not only to the glorious, unsullied light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], but also to the pure wisdom and understanding that those living in the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]] possessed. 

The Light of Valinor derived from light before any [[Arda Marred|fall]] and is the light of art binded with reason and good bound with beauty.

The Light of Valinor appeared to be a quality that the inhabitants of [[Aman]] could spread to others: the [[Eldar]] who went there and were instructed by the [[Valar]] gained much wisdom and beauty, so that they surpassed all other [[Elves|Elven]] races in greatness. When the [[Noldor]] came back to [[Middle-earth]] in the [[First Age]], they spread the Light of Valinor that was in them to the [[Edain]], so that the Edain became a nobler people.

Christianity has a concept called "Uncreated Light", being the emminence of God itself, before any fall, or anything else created. There is a branch of Orthodox theology that examines the [[Wikipedia:Tabor Light|Tabor Light]].
