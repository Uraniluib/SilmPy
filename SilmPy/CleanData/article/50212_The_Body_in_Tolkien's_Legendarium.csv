'''''The Body in Tolkien's Legendarium: Essays on Middle-earth Corporeality''''' is a [[2013]] book by Christopher Vaccaro about J.R.R. Tolkien's works.  

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|The timely collection of essays is thematically unified around the subject of corporeality. Its theoretical underpinnings emerge out of feminist, foucauldian, patristic and queer hermeneutics. The book is organized into categories specific to transformation, spirit versus body, discourse, and source material. More than one essay focuses on female bodies and on the monstrous or evil body. While Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is central to most analyses, authors also cover The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and material in The History of Middle-earth.}}
