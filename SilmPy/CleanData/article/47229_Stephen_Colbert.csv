'''Stephen Colbert''' is an American political satirist, writer, actor, comedian, and television host of Comedy Central's ''The Colbert Report'' and CBS's ''The Late Show with Stephen Colbert''. He is a Tolkien fan who had a cameo in ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''.

Tolkien scholar [[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that Colbert has offered a formerly unrecorded piece of scholarly insight into ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', by the latter's suggestion that "''[[Gandalf]] knew [[Frodo]] would fail in his quest to destroy the [[The One Ring|Ring]], because he'd seen with his own eyes that Frodo could not throw the ring into his own fire at [[Bag-End]]''".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D.
