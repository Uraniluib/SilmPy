'''Brockhouse''' was a populous family of the [[Bree-hobbits]]. Some members of the family lived in [[the Shire]]: [[Sapphira Brockhouse]] was the wife of [[Uffo Boffin]],<ref>{{App|Boffin}}</ref> and [[Bilbo Baggins]] greeted the Brockhouses among other hobbit families in his famous farewell speech on [[22 September|September 22]], {{TA|3001}}.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Brock'' is an old (up to the end of the 19th century) country word for "badger" and, in that Hobbit name, refers to its building complicated and well-ordered underground dwellings. 

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that English place-names and surnames contain this old word, such as ''Brockbanks''.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 754</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the fifth version of the first chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the Brockhouse family did not have any members living in the Shire; instead those that attended Bilbo's party were from [[Combe|Combe-under-Bree]] and were [[Hobbits]] that Bilbo had befriended on his travels.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>
