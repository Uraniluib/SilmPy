The '''Oxford English Dictionary''' ('''OED'''), or '''New English Dictionary''' as it was called at its initiation, is the standard English dictionary. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spent several years as an assistant, and several of his own words and works would be cited in it. 

==Early History==
The dictionary project started in 1878. Though it was orignially not a part of the [[University of Oxford]], the institute took over the project later. The sections covering A-H were published by [[1900]], but both the [[World War I|war]] and the death of Sir [[wikipedia:James Murray (lexicographer|James Murray]], the original editor, in [[1915]] ment that the section U-Z was not complete yet.<ref name="BioOxI">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', "2: Oxford Interlude"</ref> After Murray's death, three editors remained: [[Henry Bradley]], William Craigie, and C.T. Onions. Most of their assistants had gone to war and not returned (either not to the Dictionary or not at all), so new assistants were necessary.<ref name="RoWTaL">[[Peter Gilliver]], [[Jeffrey Marshall]] and [[Edmund Weiner]], ''[[The Ring of Words|The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary]], "Tolkien as Lexicographer"</ref>

===Second Supplement===
==The OED in Tolkien==
The OED makes two appearances in Tolkien's work. The four original editors - Murray, Bradley, Craigie and Onions - were referenced in ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'':

{{quote|Some may well ask what a blunderbuss was. Indeed, this very question, it is said, was put to the Four Wise Clerks of [[Oxenford]], and after thought they replied: 'A Blunderbuss is a short gun with a large bore firing many balls or slugs, and capable of doing execution within a limited range without exact aim. (Now superseded in civilized countries by other firearms.)' |''Farmer Giles of Ham''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (eds.) ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', page 15 (50th anniversary edition)</ref>}}

Later, in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', the N.E.D. appears:

{{quote|'Yes, ''doink'' has come on a lot lately,' said Lowdham. 'But it's not brand-new, of course. I think it's first recorded, in the Third Supplement to the N.E.D., in the fifties, in the form ''d≈èing'': seems to have started in the Air Force in the Six Year's War|[[Arundel Lowdham]]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.) ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', "[[The Notion Club Papers (Part Two)]]", page 223-224</ref>}}
