The '''Ban of the Valar''' was the ban placed by the [[Valar]] on the [[Númenóreans]], that they should not sail so far west from their [[Elenna|island]] that they could not see its coasts. The first [[King of Númenor]] who spoke against it was [[Tar-Atanamir]], believing that reaching [[Aman]] would grant them [[Immortality]]. It was the breaking of the Ban by [[Ar-Pharazôn]] that led to the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref><ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>
