"'''Long-worms'''" was another name that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used for, at least, some [[dragons]]. The only named example is [[Scatha]]:

{{blockquote|[[Frumgar]], they say, was the name of the chieftain who led his people to [[Éothéod]]. Of his son, [[Fram]], they tell that he slew [[Scatha]], the great dragon of [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]], and the land had peace from the long-worms afterwards. Thus Fram won great wealth, but was at feud with the [[Dwarves]], who claimed the hoard of Scatha.|{{App|Eorl}}}}

Tolkien regularly used "[[worms|worm]]" as a nickname for dragons - examples include [[Glaurung]]<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref> and [[Smaug]]<ref>{{H|1}}</ref> - but it is unclear how "long-worms" differ, if at all.
