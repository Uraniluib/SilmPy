__NOTOC__
'''''Ithildin''''' was a substance made by the [[Elves]] out of the metal ''[[mithril]]'' and used by the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] in constructions such as gateways. Ithildin could only be seen by the [[silmë|reflected light]] of the [[Moon]] and [[stars]], and even then remained hidden until a "[[magic]]" word was said. The designs on the [[Doors of Durin]] were made from this substance.<ref name=FR>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In the [[legendarium]], [[Gandalf]] translated ''ithildin'' as "starmoon".<ref name=FR/>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] stated that ''ithildin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, meaning "moon-star(light"), "moonlight" or "starlight". The word contains the elements ''[[Moon#Other names|Ithil]]'' ("moon") + ''[[tîn#Noun|tin/tîn]]'' ("spark; star; twinkle of stars"). He noted that the correct Sindarin form should be ''ithildim''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 39, 66</ref>
