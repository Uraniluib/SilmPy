The '''Mound of Riders''' was the burial mound raised upon the eyot in the [[Fords of Isen]], ringed with stones and surrounded by many spears.  It held all of the Men of the [[Mark]] who had fallen in the [[Battles of the Fords of Isen]].  After the battles [[Gandalf]] gathered all of the scattered [[Rohirrim]] he could find.  Some joined [[Erkenbrand]] but others Gandalf set to interring the dead and then returning to [[Edoras]].  When King [[Th√©oden]] rode to [[Isengard]] his party came upon the mound, which reassured the king that the dead had not been devoured as carrion.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>
