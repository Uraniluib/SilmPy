'''The King of the Golden Hall''' is the sixth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
Now that [[Gandalf]] had returned from the dead, he served as the captain of the hunters. He led them to [[Théoden]]'s halls, and told the guards that they had come back to return the horses that [[Éomer]] had lent them.

The four companions entered the hall after leaving their weapons behind, but they did not get a warm welcome. Théoden was reluctant to show gratitude; he said this was because Gandalf almost always brought bad news and asked for help. In truth, it was because Saruman had a secret hold on him in the form of his advisor, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]].

Gandalf freed Théoden from the wicked influence of Wormtongue. Gandalf then asked Théoden to release Éomer, who had been held prisoner of Wormtongue's counsel. Éomer returned and laid his sword at Théoden's feet. Théoden realized his mistake in trusting Wormtongue. He decided that he would himself lead the riders of [[Rohan]] against [[Saruman]]. Wormtongue was sent away.

Théoden gave [[Shadowfax]] to Gandalf. He proclaimed that [[Éowyn]] (his niece) was to rule in his place until he returned.
