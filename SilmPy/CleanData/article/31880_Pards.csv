'''Pards''' were [[Wikipedia:Felidae|feline creatures]] only mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] poetry. Apparently the pards lived in wooded lands of the East (perhaps referring to the lands beyond [[Rh√ªn]], the [[Uttermost East]]). The beast, "fleet upon feet", leaped on its prey from above.<ref name=ATB12>{{ATB|12}}</ref>

==Inspiration==

At the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]] are kept several manuscripts of medieval bestiaries containing descriptions of the legendary ''pard''. The animal is described as very swift, killing its prey with a single leap. It was believed that the mating of a pard and a [[lions|lion]] produced the leopard.<ref>"[http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast116.htm Pard]" at [http://bestiary.ca/ The Medieval Bestiary] (accessed 12 March 2011)</ref> In [[1962]] [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] published the poem "[[Cat (poem)|Cat]]",<ref name=ATB12/>, which, carrying many similarities with this medieval notion, shows that he was likely familiar with these manuscripts.
