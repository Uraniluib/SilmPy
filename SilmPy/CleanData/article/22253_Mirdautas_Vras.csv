<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Brus-kuluz taurzur bûrzu tiil-ob 
Hush-ob dhurum agh ufum dhurum 
Tor Vautu brus-troguz 
Urgai-u gukh dûmp agh tiimor 

Talaan-u rûk-ir tor urûk 
Nauru-ir agh kragoru nûrsu grishûrz 
Nork-ulu furtun agh goth 
Mordor-ob bot-tuk 

Ghaash agh akûl û Nazgûl skoiz 
Mirdautas vras! 
Karn ghaamp agh nût 
Shaut Manwû quiinubat gukh 
</poem>

'''English translation:'''
 
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Dark have been my dreams of late 
Of secret doubt and secret fear 
A thousand years have passed away 
To lay down doom and terror 

To north ride on, a thousand orcs 
On wolves with giant bloody fangs 
They take the storm and power 
Of Mordor through the world 

Fire and Ice, the [[Nazgûl]] fly 
It is a good day to kill! 
(Painted) red is Earth and sky 
Even [[Manwë]] will bow down

</poem>
