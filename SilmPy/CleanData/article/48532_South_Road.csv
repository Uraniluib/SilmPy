The '''South Road''' was a major road of [[Gondor]].

A road ran from [[Pelargir]] to the north, crossed [[Erui]] at the [[Crossings of Erui]] and reached [[Minas Tirith]] through the [[Rammas Echor]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref><ref group=note>The name "South Road" is used only by [[Bergil]]; the road that could be "the South Road" is unnamed on the map, however the context of the narrative makes this identification obvious. Cf. {{HM|Guide}}, p. 363</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], before the [[Siege of Gondor]], captains of the [[Southern Fiefs|Outlands]] were expected along the South Road.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>
