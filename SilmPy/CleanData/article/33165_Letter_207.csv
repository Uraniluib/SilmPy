==Summary==
Easter was over, the "Dutch incense"<ref group="notes">Tolkien had been sent, at [[Allen and Unwin]]'s expense, to Holland.  He had enjoyed the trip very much.</ref> dissipated, and Tolkien said he would now get busy on the Story-line.<ref group="notes">A synopsis of a proposed animated ''Lord of the Rings'', written by [[Morton Grady Zimmerman]].</ref>  First though, pleading ignorance of the jargon, he asked Unwin just what a "story-line" was and its function in the process.

If a story-line was simple directions to picture-producers then he would not waste his time on it.  However, the document gave Tolkien grave anxiety about the actual dialogue to be used.  Zimmerman was hasty, insensitive, impertinent, and quite incapable of adapting the "spoken words" of the book.  It was evident to Tolkien that Zimmerman had only skimmed ''The Lord of the Rings'' and then constructed his story-line from partly confused memories.  He got most of the names wrong (''Borimor'' for ''[[Boromir]]'') or misapplied (''[[Radagast]]'' became an Eagle).  Characters were introduced with little reference to the book.

Tolkien was very unhappy with the extreme silliness and incompetence, and the complete lack of respect for the original.  But Tolkien said that soon he would very much need money and was conscious of Unwins rights and interests.  He would endeavour to restrain himself and make no comments to [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009969/ Forrest J. Ackerman] except through Unwin and with his assent.<ref group="notes">Later Tolkien did write to Ackerman directly to spell out his issues with the story-line â€“ see [[Letter 210]].</ref>
