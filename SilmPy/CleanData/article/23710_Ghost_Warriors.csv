== Cover/Jacket Text ==

Dunland, or Dunfearan, as the region is called by its inhabitants, lies among the rugged western foothills of the southern Misty Mountains. The Great Plague swept these highlands in {{TA|1636}}, but now a worse evil scourges the Dunmen. Ghost Warriors roam by night, taking captives to swell their Undead ranks. The key to their defeat lies beyond Riddle Caves, the mysterious entrance to a dark labyrinth that twists through the roots of the mountains.

*11" x 17" FULL-COLOR MAP depicting the terrain of Dunland. 
*3 EXCITING ADVENTURES involving a clash with Dunnish Wights, a battle against a powerful shaman, and a risky venture into the Under-deeps that sprawl beneath the mountains. 
*DETAILED LAYOUTS of adventures sites including the Riddle Caves, the Path of Riddles, and the Ghost-caves. 
*GAME STATISTICS of the Beasts, Undead, and NPCs that dwell in the hills of Dunfearan.
