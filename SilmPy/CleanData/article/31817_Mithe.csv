'''Mithe''' was a body of water in [[the Shire]], the outflow of the [[Shirebourn]] river into the [[Brandywine]]. 

At the Mithe there was a landing-stage called [[Mithe Steps]],<ref>{{ATB|2}}</ref> from which a lane ran to [[Deephallow]] and so on to the [[Causeway]] road that went through [[Rushey]] and [[Stock]].<ref>{{ATB|Preface}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is obviously unrelated to the English verb ''[[Wiktionary:mithe|mithe]]'' meaning "hide, conceal, avoid".

[[Andreas Möhn]] has suggested that ''Mithe'' means "Place where two streams meet", derived from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:muþ|mūþ]]'' or ''[[Wiktionary:gemyþ|ġemȳþ]]'' "river-mouth, meeting of streams". Möhn adds that ''Mithe'' "is evidently related to 'mouth' and probably a derivative surviving in English place-names".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bombadil_in_the_Shire.html|articlename=Bombadil in the Shire|dated=|website=Lalaith |accessed=16 May 2012}}</ref>
