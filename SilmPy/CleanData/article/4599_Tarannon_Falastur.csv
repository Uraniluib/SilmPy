'''Tarannon Falastur''' ({{TA|654}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|913|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 259 years) was the twelfth [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]].

==History==
Tarannon was [[Captain of the Hosts]] and the first of the [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor, who extended the realm far along the shores west and south of the [[Ethir Anduin]].   Commemorating his victories, Tarannon assumed the name "Falastur" when he took the crown.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Tarannon was also famous for his Queen, the "nefarious, solitary, and loveless" [[Berúthiel]].  Tarannon had built a house in [[Pelargir]] that rested upon arches sunk into the [[Anduin]], but the queen refused to live within the sound and smell of the sea.  She lived in the King's House in [[Osgiliath]] where she owned cats said to be able to spy upon men.  Eventually Tarannon placed her upon a boat cast adrift at sea.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 7</ref>  He was then the first king to die without an heir, and was succeeded by his nephew, the second of the Ship-kings, [[Eärnil I]].<ref name="South"/>
