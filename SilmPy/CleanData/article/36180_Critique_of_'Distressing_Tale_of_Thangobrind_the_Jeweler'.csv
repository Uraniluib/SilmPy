'''Critique of "Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweler"''' refers to a hand-written manuscript by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], in which he offers a criticism of [[Wikipedia:Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s story "Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweler". The manuscript was found in Tolkien's copy of the fantasy anthology ''[[Swords & Sorcery]]'' (which included the story), a gift from [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (who wrote the introduction of the book). According to sales of the item, Tolkien's text is "not [a] very complementary critique".<ref>[http://www.tolkienbookshelf.com/si/000971.html# ID:000971] at [http://www.tolkienbookshelf.com TolkienBookshelf.com] (accessed 19 September 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/dmiller/000333.htm A Signed Book...] at [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/ TolkienLibrary.com] (accessed 19 September 2011)</ref>
==Excerpts==
<poem>
Jirel of Joiry. Does create an atmosphere 
and [?the] sinister 'corrupt' household of Alaric was 
eerie and credible. But I never [sic] find phantasmal 
struggles such as that of Jirel with 'Undead' Andred 
quite unconvincing — especially when the victims escape!

Dunsany at his worst. Trying so hard for 
the shudder. But not for a moment making the 
tale 'credible' enough to {pro} make a background for 
a strong [?e...]. And the ending lamentable — in 
fact [?insulting]. In a world in which a Thangobrind 
could even begin to be (let alone Hlo-hlo or [?all the rest]) 
early 19th century Riviera [?...] is surely utterly 
impossible — or vice versa. And what is meant 
by selling his daughter's soul. 

Cappen Varra. Nomenclature v[ery] bad 
Let us have genuine Scandanavian/Norse "bar- 
barians" or something invented.

The Athammaus monster wholly unbelievable 
[?…] disgusting [?... ... …]. There are lots 
of ways of being [?... as] nastily, without all this 
[?tooraloo] of nonsense. 

Most of these things are overheated & exaggerated 
([?...] bigger or [?would be] bigger, [?'...'] is
[?...] than the {ends} purposes warrant)
Also obviously over or ill-written. 

Jirel of Joiry 140 - 146 is good but 
needs a [?deft] story (and [?explication]) to [?...]
[?valid]. Dunsany's is one of his worst
