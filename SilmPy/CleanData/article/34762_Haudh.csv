__NOTOC__
'''''haudh''''' is a [[Sindarin]] word meaning "funeral mound".<ref name=PE19>{{PE|19}}, p. 91</ref>
==Etymology==
The word ''haudh'' derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''khabdā'' ("pile, (artificial) mound"), itself deriving from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHAB]] ("heap up, pile up"). Since  ''haudh'' also carried a connotation of a funeral mound "in which weapons and other valuables were also buried", the word shows an apparent influence from root [[KHAW]] ("cover up, hide away, lay in store").<ref name=PE19/>
