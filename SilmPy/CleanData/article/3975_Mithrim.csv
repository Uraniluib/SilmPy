'''Mithrim''' was a region of [[Beleriand]] in [[Middle-earth]], the south-east part of [[Hithlum]]. It was the area around [[Lake Mithrim]], surrounded by the [[Ered Wethrin]], and the '''[[Mountains of Mithrim]]''', which separated Mithrim from [[Dor-lómin]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> Mithrim's climate was the same as Hithlum's; the air was cool and the winter was cold but it was a fair land.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> Swans were frequently seen in the pools of the land.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

Mithrim was first inhabited by the [[Elves of Mithrim|Grey-elves of Mithrim]],<ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref> and then also by [[Noldor]] of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]].<ref name="Gondolin">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

==History==
Some time before the rising of the [[Moon]], [[Sindar|Sindarin Elves]] from Beleriand came over [[Ered Wethrin]] and settled in Mithrim.<ref name="Return"/>

When the [[Noldor]] returned to Middle-earth the host of [[Fëanor]] camped upon the northern shore of [[Lake Mithrim]]. [[Morgoth]] sent a host of [[Orcs]] through the [[Ered Wethrin]] to attack the newcomers and thus upper Mithrim was the scene of the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]]. The Noldor met the [[Elves of Mithrim]] and learned from them of King [[Thingol]], and tidings of what had transpired during their stay in [[Valinor]].<ref name="Return"/>

At the rising of the [[Sun]] the host of [[Fingolfin]] marched into Mithrim. After approaching [[Angband]] Fingolfin's host returned to Mithrim and camped upon the northern shore of Lake Mithrim. However, due to the rift between Fingolfin's people and the followers of Fëanor, Fingolfin relocated to the southern shores of the lake.<ref name="Return"/>

Later in the [[First Age]] Mithrim was ruled by Fingolfin, as it formed the most densely populated part of Hithlum.<ref name=Beleriand/> However, after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] Morgoth overran Mithrim and all of Hithlum and afterwards turned the land over to the [[Swarthy Men]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

In the winter of the year of the Nirnaeth [[Rían]] gave birth to [[Tuor]] in the wilds of Mithrim, where some Grey-elves yet remained. [[Annael]] of the Elves who dwelt there in the caves of [[Androth]] fostered Tuor after Rían departed Hithlum.<ref name=Gondolin/>

All [[Beleriand]] was deluged in the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of that Age.
