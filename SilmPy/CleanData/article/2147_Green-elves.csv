The '''Green-elves''' ([[Quenya|Q]] '''''[[Green-elves#Etymology|Laiquendi]]''''', [[Sindarin|S]] '''''[[Green-elves#Etymology|Laegrim]]'''''; also '''Green Elves'''<ref>{{PM|XI4}}, p. 349</ref>) were a clan of the [[Nandor]].<ref name=WJC/>

==History==

[[Lenwë]] was an [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[Telerin]] clan, who set out with the [[Great Journey]] of the [[Elves]] into the West. When his people found their path blocked by the [[Misty Mountains]], he resolved to leave the Journey and instead led his followers south down the [[Vales of Anduin]], and they became known as the Nandor. After many years, Lenwë's son [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]] set out westward once again, and led some part of the Nandor across the Misty Mountains and the Blue, settling at last in the [[Ossiriand|Land of Seven Rivers]] beneath the [[Ered Luin]]; the land called [[Ossiriand]].

Denethor and his followers did not have peace for long. Soon after his return to [[Middle-earth]], before the [[Noldor]] had followed him, [[Morgoth]] loosed armies of orcs on King [[Thingol]] and his allies, [[Círdan]] in the west and Denethor in the east. Denethor's Nandor were ill-equipped for warfare, and suffered great hardship in that battle. Denethor himself was slain on [[Amon Ereb]], though the Elves beat back the [[orcs]] at last. After that time many of Denethor's people left Ossiriand for the guarded forests of [[Doriath]]: these settled in [[Arthórien]] and became known as the [[Guest-elves]].<ref name=UT>{{UT|2d}}</ref><ref name=WJP1>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 112-3</ref> Those few that remained took up a secretive existence, camouflaging themselves in green. From that time, they were known as the Green-elves.

The hidden people of the Green-elves played little part in history after the [[First Battle]] of the [[Wars of Beleriand]]. Most significantly, they lent their aid to [[Beren]] and [[Dior]] (who dwelt on [[Tol Galen]] in the far south of their land). After the loss of their ancient ally Thingol at the hands of the [[Dwarves]], they went with Beren to avenge him. Much later, after the deaths of Beren and [[Lúthien]], one of their lords took up the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] that Lúthien had borne, and brought it to [[Menegroth]] where Dior now dwelt.

After the end of the [[First Age]], their fate is not clearly known. Much of their land survived the destruction of [[Beleriand]], and as [[Lindon]] came under the rule of [[Gil-galad]]. Some at least seem to have removed to [[Eriador]], and dwelled on the shores of [[Lake Evendim|Lake Nenuial]] during the [[Second Age]]<ref>A note in the [[Unfinished Tales]]</ref>. After this, nothing is known of their fate.

==Etymology==

The [[Sindarin]] name '''''Laegrim''''' (class plural; sing ''Laegel'', pl ''Laegil'') or ''Laegel(d)rim'', meaning "Green-elves", was a name used by the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] for the inhabitants of [[Ossiriand]] and [[Lindon]]. This term was translated by the [[Noldor]] to [[Quenya]] '''''Laiquendi'''''.<ref name=WJC>{{WJ|C}}, p. 385</ref><ref group="note">While [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] states in the late manuscript ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]'' (ca. 1959-60) that the Quenya form ''Laiquendi'' "was not much used" (p. 385), it is the only [[Elvish]] translation of "Green-elves" which occurs in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.</ref>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] appears early Elvish names for the Green-elves: [[Qenya]] ''Laiqendi'' and [[Noldorin]] ''Lhoebenidh'' or ''Lhoebelidh''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 368 ([[Sundocarme|root]] LÁYAK)</ref>
