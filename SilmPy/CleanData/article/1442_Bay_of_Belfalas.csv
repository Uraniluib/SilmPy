The '''Bay of Belfalas''', also called the '''windy Bay of Bel''',<ref>{{AB|Down}}</ref><ref name=VT>{{VT|42a}}, p. 15</ref> was a great gulf of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] lying to the south of [[Gondor]], within whose waters stood the island of [[Tolfalas]]; the River [[Anduin]] flowed into the Bay. Directly north of the Bay was the Gondorian region of [[Belfalas]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

The shores around the Bay were mostly desolate in the [[Second Age]], except from a [[First Age]] settlement of [[Sindar]] which became the haven [[Edhellond]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref><ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref>

During the [[Drowning of Númenor]], the Bay of Belfalas was much filled at the east and south, and land upheaved around it. Anduin carved a new path by many [[Ethir Anduin|mouths]] to the Bay.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> Tolfalas was almost destroyed, and was left at last like a barren and lonely mountain in the water not far from the issue of the River.

The coasts of Gondor were assaulted by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. In {{TA|2758}} three fleets from [[Umbar]] attacked and waged war on all the Gondorian coasts until [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|Beregond]] overcame the invaders.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
