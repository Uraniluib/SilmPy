==Life==
Glyer was introduced to the [[Inklings]] at High School. She read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and became interested in the friendship of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]]. She would spend twenty years working on research about it, focusing mainly on completeness of primary sources. 

In 1997 she received the ''[[Clyde S. Kilby]] Research Grant''. This endowed award is presented annually by the Steering Committee of the [http://www.wheaton.edu/wadecenter/ Marion E. Wade Center] to a scholar engaged in a publishable project related to one of the seven authors on which the Center focuses. The intention of the award is both to recognize scholarly contributions and also to assist the work of those who use the resources of the Wade Center. 

This grant pushed her drive to publish her twenty years of labor. ''[[The Company They Keep]]'' was published in [[2007]].
