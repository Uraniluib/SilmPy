'''Tevildo''' was the '''"Prince of Cats"''' in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]''. He appeared in the form of a great black [[Cats|cat]] with a collar of gold. During the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Beren]] was captured by Melko and sent as a servant to Tevildo. However the cat was defeated by [[Huan]] and [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]] when they forced him to reveal the spell which held the stones of his castle together and which held cats under his evil sway. When his collar was removed the other cats shrunk.<ref name="LT2I">{{LT2|I}}</ref>

Later Tevildo's place in the narrative was replaced by that of the Necromancer, [[Thû]] (later renamed Sauron), in the [[legendarium]]. Thû (and later Sauron) was the "Lord of Werewolves", in contrast to Tevildo's position as "Prince of Cats"; the cat-versus-dog theme prominent in the ''Tale of Tinúviel'' was thus eliminated in later writings.<ref name="LT2I"/>

== Etymology ==
The name is [[Qenya]]. Although it is not given a literal translation, it is said to derive from the root TEFE signifying hate or hatred. His [[Gnomish]] name is '''Tifil'''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>

The title of "Prince of Cats" had also been used for the character Tybalt from William Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet''.
