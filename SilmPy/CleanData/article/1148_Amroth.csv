'''Amroth''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]].

==History== 
Amroth was the son of [[Amdír]], the [[Sindar]]in king of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]. After his father's death in {{SA|3434}} in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], he became king of the [[Galadhrim]]. He lived for long time in peace in the manner of the [[Silvan Elves]], because of his love for [[Nimrodel]]. 

Nimrodel however hated the [[elves]] who came from the West, [[Sindar]] and [[Noldor]], and the wars they brought to [[Middle-earth]]. After many debates, Nimrodel said to Amroth that she would marry him if he took her to a land of peace. Such a land no longer existed in Middle-earth, but Amroth spoke about the Havens in the South such as [[Edhellond]], and the way to the [[Aman|Ancient West]].

Together, they began a journey to the south. They went to [[Gondor]] in the days of [[Eärnil II]], but then they were separated. Amroth went to the Havens alone and there he found a few [[Elves]] who wanted to sail to the West. But they wouldn't wait for [[Nimrodel]]. 

Finally, because of the great love that Amroth bore towards her, they waited, living on their ship till the end of the autumn. One night, they faced a great storm that led their ship to unknown seas. The ship finally found its way to [[Tol Eressëa]] and was never to be seen in Middle-earth again. But Amroth, in the dawn, when he realized that the ship was far away, leapt into the sea and fought against the waves, and by the [[Bay of Belfalas]], he drowned.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

The hill near which he drowned was named [[Dol Amroth]] to honor him; the Elvish settlement became a [[Men|Mannish]] realm as the last Elves of that land departed for the West.<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Amroth translates to "up-climber" which makes sense as in some versions of the legendarium he was the inventor of the [[talan]] or [[flet]]. 

The name Amroth is originally from a [[Silvan Elvish]] dialect.<ref>{{App|F1}}</ref>

==Other Versions==
In earlier versions of the legendarium, Amroth was briefly [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]'s son, brother to [[Celebrían]]. In this version of the legendarium, he lived in [[Eregion]] and fled with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celebrían]] after the revolt of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] encouraged by [[Sauron]] between {{SA}} 1350 and 1400. He led an attack on [[Sauron]]'s forces and fought with the host of Dúrin in about {{SA|1697}}. Later, [[Galadriel]] left the [[Lothlorien|Lórinand]] to Amroth when she went to dwell by the sea.
