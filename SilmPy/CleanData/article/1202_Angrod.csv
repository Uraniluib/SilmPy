}}'''Angrod''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈaŋrɔd]}}; [[Years of the Trees]] – {{FA|455}}) was a son of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] and a lord of the [[Noldor]]. 

He was the elder brother of [[Aegnor]] and [[Galadriel]], and the younger brother of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. Together with Aegnor he held the highlands of [[Dorthonion]] against [[Morgoth]]. Angrod and Aegnor were both slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame").<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Angrod's [[father-name]] was '''Angaráto''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌaŋɡaˈraːtɔ]}}), meaning "Iron Champion" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[anga]]'' = "iron" and ''[[aráto]]'' = "champion"). The name ''Angrod'' is the [[Sindarin]] form of Angaráto.  It is written in the ''[[Shibboleth]]'' that probably both he and Finrod received the same name ''[[Aráto]]'', and this later differentiated to ''[[Finrod|Findaráto]]'' and the above.  Angrod's [[epessë]] was ''[[Angamaitë]]'' "iron-handed" (from ''[[anga]]'' + ''[[maitë]]'').

== History ==


Angrod was the first of the Noldorin Exiles to enter [[Doriath]] as a messenger from Finrod. Upon returning with a terse warning from [[Thingol]], he was mocked by [[Caranthir]] for relaying what was perceived as an empty threat. Angrod was angered by this, having omitted negative details of their exile like the [[First Kinslaying]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

Later while visiting Galadriel (who was living in Doriath at the time) with his brothers, Thingol accused them of deceiving him for hiding their misdeeds against his kin. Angrod spoke out in anger, pointing out the grievous wrongs they endured as well. This led directly to Thingol banning the use of Quenya throughout Beleriand.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

Together with Aegnor he held the highlands of [[Dorthonion]] against [[Morgoth]]. Aegnor and Angrod were both slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] by the flames from [[Thangorodrim]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
From the earliest writings (for example, the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'') till after the publication of the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' [[Orodreth]] is given as Angrod and [[Felagund]]'s brother instead. This was retained in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', although the changes of their father's name from Finrod to [[Finarfin]] and of ([[Inglor]]) Felagund's name to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] were adopted there. Also, in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' [[Gil-galad]] is the son of [[Fingon]], this was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] which he admitted was a mistake.
