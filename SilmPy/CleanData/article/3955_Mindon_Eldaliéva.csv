'''Mindon Eldaliéva''' was the tower of [[Ingwë]], the [[High King of the Elves]], which was built upon the summit of [[Túna]] in the city of [[Tirion]] within the [[Calacirya]]. The city had many towers of white stone and the highest was the Mindon Eldaliéva, surmounted by a silver lamp whose beams radiated far into the mists of the sea.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

==History==
The [[Eldar]] raised the hill of [[Túna]] and constructed the city of [[Tirion]] and the tower of Mindon upon it in {{YT|1140}}. In {{YT|1142|n}}, [[Yavanna]] gave the [[Noldor]] the tree [[Galathilion]], the image of [[Telperion]] (although it gave no light of its own), and the Elves planted it in the great court beneath the Mindon.<ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>

The house of [[Finwë]] fronted the great square below the Mindon, and it was in this house that the unrest of the [[Noldor]] manifested itself in {{YT|1490}}<ref>{{MR|P2j}}</ref> when [[Fëanor]] drew his sword upon [[Fingolfin]] and accused him of usurping his place and the love of his father.<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>

In {{YT|1495}}<ref>{{MR|P2m}}</ref> when [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]] stole the light of [[Valinor]] and the [[Silmarils]], Fëanor came to the court below the Mindon. There he voiced his grievances against the Valar, persuaded great numbers of the Elves to return to [[Middle-earth]], and swore (with his seven sons) the [[Oath of Fëanor]]. While those of the House of Fëanor did not look back as they began their march, many of the noblest and wisest did glance behind as Tirion receded, and the lamp of the Mindon Eldaliéva was their last sight of their city.

As the Elves marched, a dark figure appeared upon a rock and proclaimed the [[Doom of Mandos]]. Although Fëanor and great numbers of his followers ignored the prophetic curse, [[Finarfin]] repented and returned, to behold once more the beam of the Mindon in the darkness.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Mindon Eldaliéva means "(Our) Tower of the [[Eldar]]" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[mindon]]'' = "lofty tower", ''[[Eldalië]]'' = alternative term for "[[Eldar]]", and ''-[[va]]'' = possessive ending). The possessive ending implies an exclusive, sacred place.
