==History==
===Youth===
The ancestors of Eradan were members of a noble family from [[Númenor]], who served [[Elendil]]. After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they went in exile to [[Middle-earth]] and lived in [[Arnor]], where they served the [[Kings of Arnor|heirs of Elendil]]. After the fall of that kingdom they continued to serve the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]].

While Baranor and a company of Dúnedain patrolled the [[Misty Mountains]] he didn't return. After the loss of his father, Eradan was fostered by his uncle, [[Dunhir]].

===Life as a Ranger===
After he was grown up he started his training to be a Ranger. After only two years he completed his training and started to fight the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and [[Trolls]] who roamed the east of [[Eriador]]. Eradan gained a high reputation as swordsman and archer, and his skills as outdoorsman and tracker were exceptional high. 

When Aragorn doubled the defenses of [[the Shire]] Eradan served as one of the guards of [[Sarn Ford]] for many years under the command of [[Halbarad]]. In {{TA}} 3016 Aragorn became more active in the Shire's defense. In this time Eradan impressed Aragorn with his skills and bravery. Eradan accompenied Aragorn on many of his travels, on which Aragorn taught him even more about tracking.<ref name="Backstory Eradan"/> In {{TA|3018}} he met [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] and [[Andriel]] as they joined the guards of the [[Sarn Ford]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=The Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=24 December 2011}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Aragorn, Eradan, Andriel and Farin in the Prancing Pony.png|300px|thumb|[[Andriel]], '''Eradan''' and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] meet [[Aragorn]] in the [[Prancing Pony]].]]When the [[Nazgûl]] attacked the [[Sarn Ford]] all three fought under the command of Halbarad in an attempt to prevent them entering the Shire. They were defeated and most of the rangers were killed. After the attack, Eradan, Andriel and Farin saw and overheard a meeting between the [[Witch-king]] and [[Agandaûr]]. Agandaûr told the Witch-king he had assembled an army of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] in [[Fornost]]. 

Halbarad sent the three to [[Bree]], where they meet with Aragorn in the [[Prancing Pony]]. They tell Aragorn what happened, who sends them to Fornost, where they have to stop Agandaûr's army before it attacks [[Bree]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Prologue</ref>

In the inner wards of Fornost the companions meet with [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], who've been sent by [[Elrond|their father]] to scout Fornost. Andriel introduces Eradan and Farin to Elladan and Elrohir. After finding out they're appointed to deal with the same task, the two groups decide to work together. Firstly Elladan and Elrohir lead Eradan and his friends to the citadel, but latter on they take seperate roads.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner wards''</ref> But meet again - after surviving several ambushes - at the gate of the citadel. The gate of the citadel has been protected by Agandaûr with [[magic]]. As the sons of [[Elrond]] use all their power and concentration to remove the magical protection, Eradan, Andriel, Farin and Beleram protect them against an attack of [[Orcs]] and a [[Troll]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref>

Inside the Citadel tower the group overhear a conservation between Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], who informs the earlier about intruders. Here, Eradan, Andriel and Farin are again seperated from the sons of Elrond. The earlier fight and kill Tharzog and his guard. After which they proceed to the top of the tower, where they find Agandaûr fighting the sons of Elrond. Agandaûr - seeing he is outnumbered - flees on a [[Fell Beast]]. Although Beleram chases him, he has to give up after Agandaûr creates a thunderstorm.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>
