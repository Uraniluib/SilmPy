'''Amnon''' was a [[Seer]] of the [[First Age]].  His only recorded prophesy was "Great is the [[Fall of Gondolin]]",<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, p. 172</ref> which was quoted again by [[Turgon]], King of [[Gondolin]], at the time the event took place.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 184</ref>

== Inspiration ==
In the Bible, Amnon was the wicked eldest son of David.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was surely aware of this character (as he was a Catholic), and it is curious to speculate on his particular choosing of this name, as it was in his earlier works.
