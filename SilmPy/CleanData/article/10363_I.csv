__NOTOC__
'''''i''''' (plural '''''in''''' in [[Sindarin]]) is the [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] article "the" and relative pronoun "who".
==Sindarin==
===Mutations===
In Sindarin, the singular form causes [[lenition]] to the following word. For example ''[[tâl]]'' "foot" > ''i '''d'''âl'' "the foot".<ref>{{HM|LR}} p. 298</ref>

The plural form causes [[nasal mutation]], and the final -''n'' is assimilated. For example ''[[Perian|Periain]]'' "[[Halflings]]" > ''i'''n+P'''eriain'' > ''i-'''Ph'''eriain'' "the Halflings".<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>

(The affection is usually noted with a hyphen or a dot between article and word.)

===Related forms===
These Sindarin prepositions contain the suffixed article ''-in'':

*''[[nan (preposition)|nan]]'' "to the"
*''[[ben]]'' "according to the"
*''[[nuin]]'' "under the"
*''[[erin]]'' "on the"
*''[[uin (preposition)|uin]]'' "of the"

The above combined articles when before a word, cause a peculiar phenomenon of lenition different from the above.<ref>http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm#mixed</ref>

==As a relative pronoun==
<!-- note: this should be moved to ye/ya -->
In both Quenya and Sindarin, ''i'' is used for the relative pronoun "who" or a conjunction "that", introducing a secondary phrase. In Quenya it is usually the plural form of ''[[ya]]/[[ye]]'' but can also be used in the Singular.

For example:
*''[[Perhael]], '''i''' [[sennui]] "[[Panthael]]" [[esta]]thar [[aen]]'' "[[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], '''who''' ought to be called 'Fullwise'"<ref>{{HM|SD}}, [[King's Letter]]</ref>
*''[[Ilúvatar|Eru]] '''i''' [[or]] [[ilya|ilye]] [[mahalma]]r [[ea (verb)|ea]]'' "the One, '''who''' is above all thrones"

In Quenya, it can also be declined as a noun:
*'''''illon''' [[cam]]nelyes'' "'''from whom''' you received it?"<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 21</ref>
