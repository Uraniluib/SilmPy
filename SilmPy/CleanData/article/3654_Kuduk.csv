'''Kuduk''' (pl. *'''Kudugin''') was the actual [[Westron]] word with which the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]s called themselves. It is translated as "Hobbit."
==Etymology==
It is suggested that this developed from an older word, ''[[k没d-d没kan]]'', meaning '[[holbytlan|hole-builder]]'. Although the Hobbits called themselves ''kuduk'', they had forgotten the meaning of the word.<ref name="App">{{App|F2}}</ref>
==Other versions==
Before this published word, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] considered the form ''c没buc'' pl. ''c没bugin'' which was apparently dropped later.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, p. 49</ref>
