'''Sagroth''' was one of the guards that [[Hardang]], the [[Halad|Warden of Brethil]], had assigned to keep watch at the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]].  He was the first to spot the sleeping [[Húrin]]  when he had come to that place.  A fellow guard, [[Forhend]], said that Sagroth could be trusted to always find trouble, for he knew that Hardang would not be pleased with the discovery of Húrin within Brethil. <ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 274</ref>

Later, when Hardang wanted to send [[Manthor]] away while he dealt with Húrin, he told him to go until Captain [[Avranc]] came to take command (this was an on-the-spot promotion of Avranc).  Manthor immediately quit his service to Hardang and stated that he had left Sagroth, "a woodman older and wiser" than Avranc in command.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 274</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
When "[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]" was in draft form, in the second appearance of Sargoth's name it was emended to ''Galhir'' but then returned to Sargoth.<ref >{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 24, p. 302</ref>
