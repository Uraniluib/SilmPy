{{disambig-more|Host of the West|[[Host of the West (disambiguation)]]}}

The '''Host of the West''' was a combined allied force of [[Elves]] and [[Dúnedain]] during the [[Angmar War]]. 
==Formation==
The host composed of a vast army from Gondor (actually just a small force compared to the full might of Gondor) that arrived in a massive fleet, which could barely find harborage, even after filling [[Forlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]], and the [[Grey Havens]].{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  

Although [[Eärnur|Eärnur's]] arrival at [[Mithlond]] was extremely praised, the horses were praised, for many of them came from the [[Vales of Anduin]] and with them were riders tall and fair, and proud princes of Rhovanion.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> 

[[Círdan]], Lord of Lindon, summoned all who would fight from the [[Elves of Lindon]], as well as the remnants of the [[Dúnedain of the North]]. Among the forces of former Arthedain were some [[Hobbits]] from [[the Shire]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|1973}} [[Arthedain]] was in danger and King [[Eärnil II]] sent his son Prince [[Earnur]] and a massive fleet to their aid. After [[Arnor]] [[fall of Fornost|fell]] to [[Angmar]], Prince [[Eärnur]], in his capacity as [[Captain of Gondor]], reached belatedly [[Lindon]] with his fleet to the aid of Arthedain. 

Although it was too late, the fleet and the host it brought, seemed so massive, that there was much joy and wonder among Elves and Men. The allied host, led by Cirdan and Earnur, marched east across the river [[Lune]] to [[Fornost]] to challenge the [[Witch-king]], and crushed him at the [[Battle of Fornost]] ({{TA|1975}}).

After the main part of the Battle, the Host was joined by a force of Elves of [[Rivendell]] led by [[Glorfindel]], who chased the Witch-king.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>
