}}'''Pearl Took''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Pearl was the eldest child of [[Thain]] [[Paladin Took II]] and [[Eglantine Banks]].<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref> She was the caretaker of [[Lalia Clayhanger|Lalia the Fat]], the rotund, aged, and immensely annoying (to the Tooks) matriarch of the family. Each morning, Pearl was to push her wheelchair outside so Lalia could experience fresh air.<ref name="L214">{{L|214}}</ref>

In {{SR|1401}} she was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. <ref name="Took"/>

One morning in {{SR|1402}}, Pearl was a little bit careless in her custom of tending old Lalia, and the matriarch flew across the steps to her death. Pearl was excluded from the accession ceremony of [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]], who had been waiting to become head of the clan for quite a while (he had already been Thain since the death of his father). She was, however, afterwards spotted with a necklace of pearls believed to be a Took family heirloom.<ref name="L214"/>

==Etymology==
[[wikipedia:Pearl|Pearl]]'s name follows the Hobbit custom of high-class women being named after jewels.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>
