==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), renowned author of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, was an artist in pictures as well as in words. Though he often remarked that he had no talent for drawing, his art has charmed his readers and has been exhibited to large and appreciative audiences. In fact, his talent was far more than he admitted, and his sense of design was natural and keen. This book explores Tolkien's art at length, from his childhood paintings and drawings to his final sketches. At its heart are his illustrations for his books, especially his tales of Middle-earth. Also examined are the pictures Tolkien made for his children (notably in his 'Father Christmas' letters and for the story of [[Mr. Bliss]]), his expressive calligraphy, his love of decoration, and his contributions to the typography and design of his books. ''J.R.R. Tolkien, Artist and Illustrator'' includes 200 reproductions, many in colour and over half published for the first time.}}
