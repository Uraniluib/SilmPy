'''Weather Hills''' was the name among [[Men]] for the north-south range of hills that lay in central [[Eriador]], specifically between [[Bree-land]] and [[Hoarwell]]. The most significant peak was [[Weathertop]]/Amon Sûl, lay at the southern end of the range adjacent to the [[Great East Road]]. 
==History==
In the early [[Second Age]] the Hills were occupied by [[Middle Men]], as well as [[North Downs]] and the [[Lake Evendim]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> In the year {{SA|600}} [[Vëantur]] first returned to [[Middle-earth]] from [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Upon hearing that some of their distant kin had come, these [[Middle Men]] petitioned [[Gil-galad]] to meet the mariners. Twelve men came and rejoiced to meet the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 3</ref>

It marked part of the border between the lands of [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]]. When [[Angmar]] was formed and Rhudaur became hostile to Arthedain, [[Argeleb I]] fortified the range but after the enemies laid siege to the Hills, Argeleb fell ({{TA|1356}}).

With the help of [[Cardolan]] and [[Elves of Lindon|Lindon]], [[Arveleg I]] drove out the enemies from the Hills and Arnor kept a guarded border along the Weather Hills, the East Road and the lower Hoarwell. 

In {{TA|1409}}, Angmar and Rhudaur crossed the Hoarwell, occupied Cardolan, and closed in on Weathertop.

Marks of this fortification still existed in the path [[Aragorn]] led the hobbits on to reach Weathertop.

==Inspiration==
* Possibly the Lickey Hills, Worcestershire, England.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: The Weather Hills, called ''Emyn Sûl'' ("Hills of the Wind") in Sindarin, run some ninety miles north-west to south-east. Local inhabitants work a few small mines or keep grazing sheep.<ref>{{ICE|2023}}, pp. 23, 49</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Weather Hills form the boundary of [[Bree-land]] with the [[Lone-lands]]. A small river originated in the dell of Bleakrift a short distance north-west of [[Weathertop]] and flowed south-west into the [[Midgewater Marshes]]. The Midgewater Pass crossed this river, allowing passage into the hills north of the [[East Road]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], the hills were infested with [[orcs]], goblins, [[half-orcs]] and [[wargs]] both from [[Angmar]] and from [[Isengard]]. The [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] Candaith watched over the hills before travelling south as part of the [[Grey Company]].
