==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an early genealogical table for the Haladin, Halmir had a son named ''Haldor'' which became ''Hundar'' and finally ''Haldir''.  With the final change a second son named Hundar was added to the table and both brothers fought and died in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.<ref name="Haladin">{{WJ|West}}, ''(iii) The Haladin'', p. 236</ref>
