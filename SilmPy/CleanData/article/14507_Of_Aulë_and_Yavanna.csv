'''Of Aulë and Yavanna''' is the second chapter of the [[Quenta Silmarillion]] section within ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

==Synopsis==
[[Aulë]], who was the great smith of the [[Valar]], wished to create life whom he could teach his craft to. His impatience waiting for the [[Elves]] to awake got the best of him and Aulë secretly decided to create the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]]. [[Ilúvatar]], also known as [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] (the One), soon learned of Aulë's actions and Aulë was forced to destroy his creations. However Ilúvatar now did not want to see the [[Dwarves]] destroyed, so he granted them life of their own. They had to however rest until the [[Awakening of the Elves]] who Eru had chosen to be the Firstborn of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]].

When [[Yavanna]], the spouse of Aulë, learned of her husband's deeds, she feared the Dwarves, or even the Elves and [[Men]] to harm her [[plants]] and [[trees]] which she loved. She went to [[Manwë]] to seek protection. Manwë had a vision of the [[Song of Creation]] in which Eru told him not to fear as spirits would also awake to protect what Yavanna held dear.
