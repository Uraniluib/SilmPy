==Summary==
Tolkien reported to Waldman that Sir [[Stanley Unwin]] had written to him personally to tell him that his letter had set [[Allen and Unwin]] a problem.  Unwin had asked if the million words<ref group="note">Tolkien's overestimate of the combined length of ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''</ref> could be broken into three or four somewhat self-contained volumes.

Tolkien perceived that it was Unwin's opinion that his mass of stuff was not suitable for publication, since he had stressed that ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' went together as one long Saga of the Jewels and the Rings and that he was resolved to treat them as one long thing.  ''The Lord of the Rings'' was not divisible except into artificial fragments.  He had told Unwin that he would not be surprised if he declined the monstrous Saga.

There rested the matter, said Tolkien, and he profoundly hoped that Unwin would let go without demanding the manuscript.  Tolkien felt that time was short because he would soon be plunged back into business.  Unwin had also mentioned that ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham|Farmer Giles]]'' had sold only 2,000 copies and Tolkien had replied that he had seen no advertisements.

Tolkien mentioned that he would be moving at some uncertain date but that Merton College would always be able to find him.
