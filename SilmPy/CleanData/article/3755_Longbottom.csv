'''Longbottom''' was a village or town in the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> It was the home of some of the [[Hornblower Family|Hornblowers]]. The village and its surroundings were sheltered from the elements, probably by the valley's sides.

In {{TA|2670}} (1070 by the [[Shire-reckoning]]), a certain [[Tobold Hornblower]] introduced a new herb there.<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> The valley's sheltered aspect, and the relatively warm climate of the Southfarthing, made the region around Longbottom ideal for growing this new plant, [[pipe-weed]], which rapidly became the centre of a thriving industry. [[Longbottom Leaf]] remained one of the most famous varieties of the weed.

==Etymology==
The element bottom is frequent in English place-names (and their surnames like [[wikipedia:Ramsbottom|Ramsbottom]]); it means "valley", especially its head or inner end.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 773</ref>

[[David Salo]] suggests that it represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Langbotm'' meaning "Long Valley".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
