'''Mirrormere''' was the lake located beneath the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] of  [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. It lay in the southeast corner of [[Dimrill Dale]]. Mirrormere was the source of the river [[Celebrant|Silverlode]].
==History==
According to the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]], after [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] had awoken at [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] in the north of the [[Misty Mountains]], he travelled south until he came upon this lake. He looked down in it and saw a [[Durin's Crown|crown]] above his head, being the reflection of stars above, despite the fact it was day and the stars should not have been visible. Taking the crown as a sign, he founded the great city of Khazad-dûm beneath the mountains that fed Mirrormere.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref> A pillar called [[Durin's Stone]] was placed along the banks of the lake to mark the event.

During the events that led up to the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] passed by the lake after escaping [[Moria]]. Despite their hurry, [[Gimli]] would not leave without looking in the lake. [[Frodo Baggins]] joined him, and both saw Durin's crown.<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

==Names==

In [[Khuzdul]], the lake was called '''''[[Kheled-zâram]]'''''.

The [[Sindarin]] name (not appearing in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') was '''''Nen Cenedril''''' ("Lake Looking-glass").<ref>{{HM|RS}}, p. 466 (note 39)</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 37</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Mirrormere is located just west of the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] and is the source of [[Celebrant]]. The player can make out stars on the surface of the lake during the day light hours and more clearly during the night time.
