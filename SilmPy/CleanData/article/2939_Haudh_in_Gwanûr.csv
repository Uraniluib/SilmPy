'''Haudh in Gwanûr''' was the burial mound of [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], erected at their death in {{TA|2885}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

==History==
[[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], the twin sons of [[Folcwine|King Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]], had come South to answer the [[Oath of Eorl]]. They fought the [[Haradrim]] alongside the [[Gondorians]], but were slain on the banks of the [[Poros]].

They were laid to rest near the Crossings of Poros according to the tradition of the [[Rohirrim]], and it is said that all enemies of [[Gondor]] were afraid to pass the tomb.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that ''Haudh in Gwanûr'' means "mound of the brothers" in [[Sindarin]], consisting of ''[[haudh]]'' ("mound, grave, tomb") + ''[[in]]'' (pl. genitive article) + ''[[gwanûr]]''.<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#h Compound Sindarin names] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 19 June 2011)</ref> In editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' prior to the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|2004 edition]], the circumflex (^) was omitted.<ref>Cf.
