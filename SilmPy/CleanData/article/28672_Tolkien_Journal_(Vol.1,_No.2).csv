'''''Tolkien Journal'' (Vol.1, No.2)''' is an issue of the ''[[Tolkien Journal]]''. The issue was reprinted on a folded four page sheet with Volume 1, Issue 1 of ''Tolkien Journal''.

On pages 1-2, "The Ace Books Controversy" by [[Dick Plotz]] includes extracts from a letter in which Tolkien relates details of the saga of the Ace Books Edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''. The extract was reprinted in [[Orcrist 4|''Orcrist'' Issue 4]], as part of "An Ace Mystery: Did Tolkien Write His Own Retraction" by [[Bonniejean Christensen]].

"Tolkien Notes from All Over" (on page 3) includes a plea from Tolkien for an explanation of the cover of the Ballantine edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'': "''Can any member of the T.S.A. tell me what a lion and emus are doing in the vignette, or what is the thing with pink bulbs in the foreground? The publishers won't say and merely sob because I don't approve.''"
