The '''Gulf of Lune''' was a sea-arm in the rough shape of an arrowhead that broke through the range of the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]] into [[Eriador]].

The Gulf of Lune, named after the river [[Lhûn]] or "Lune", was created during the [[War of Wrath]] when [[Beleriand]] was broken. Possibly through the location of the [[Bay of Balar]],<ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Hisweloke - Géographie - Mystère géographiques (1) : Mont Dolmed et cités naines...]</ref> [[Belegaer]] broke through the mountains, creating the Gulf of Lune.

The remnant of Beleriand north of the gulf became known as [[Forlindon]], and the part south of it as [[Harlindon]]. At the eastern end of the Gulf the [[Grey Havens]] were established, but smaller havens were established in Forlindon and Harlindon as well: [[Forlond]] and [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]].

During the [[Second Age]] the ships of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]]s first came to the Gulf of Lune to visit the [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]] under [[Gil-galad]] who remained behind, and during the [[Third Age]] from it the ships of the [[Eldar]] passed away into the [[Aman|West]].
