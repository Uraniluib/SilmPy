===Examples===

==Sindarin/Noldorin==

'''''mindon''''' means "isolated hill ... especially a hill with a watch-tower" in [[Noldorin]].<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 373, 395</ref> Evidently, this meaning was retained in [[Sindarin]] in the contraction ''min'', as [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote in his [[Index questions|unfinished index]] that ''Min-Rimmon'' meant "peak of the Rimmon".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 511</ref><ref group="note">It is a bit unclear if Hammond and Scull interpret the meaning to be Sindarin, or if Tolkien so actually wrote in the unpublished manuscript.</ref>

===Etymology===

From [[Primitive Quendian]] ''minitunda'' or ''minitaun'', derived from [[Sundocarme|roots]] [[MINI]] + [[TUN]].<ref name=LR/>

===Examples===

*[[Min-Rimmon]]
