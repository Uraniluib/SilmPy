The '''Breaking of the Fellowship''' was an event that occurred on [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}. It involved the death of [[Boromir]] at the hands of the [[Uruk-hai]] and the splitting of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], two [[hobbits]], were taken prisoner by the Uruks. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]], the other two hobbits, set out on the last and most dangerous part of the [[Quest of the Ring]] through the [[Emyn Muil]]. The remaining members, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], set out to try and rescue the two captured hobbits, Merry and Pippin.

While the Fellowship camped on the western side of the [[Anduin]] near the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]], they realised that they must choose whether to go to [[Mordor]] and destroy the [[The One Ring|Ring]] or to [[Minas Tirith]] in [[Gondor]] so that the fellowship could aid the defence of the city. Frodo began to feel overwhelmed by the decision and asked to leave in order to think more on the choice. While he was thinking, Boromir came to him, unseen by the Fellowship, and talked of great battles and victories, to which Frodo did not listen much. Then, Boromir asked Frodo to lend him the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir attacked Frodo, who fled to take one of the boats across the Anduin to the eastern shore, in order to start his journey alone. Back in the camp, the other members of the Fellowship had realised Frodo was missing, not knowing that he had fled from Boromir. Merry and Pippin went running off in one direction, Legolas and Gimli in another, and Samwise in another. But Samwise understood his master's plan and ran to the shore to follow Frodo. Boromir fell, pierced by many arrows, defending Merry and Pippin against many Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin were taken, because it was believed that one of them had the Ring, and should thus be taken to [[Isengard]] to be questioned and tortured by [[Saruman]], who wanted the Ring for himself. Aragorn heard Boromir tell that he had attacked Frodo, but Aragorn kept this secret for a long while before revealing it to anyone. Boromir was placed in a boat and sent off the Falls of Rauros.
