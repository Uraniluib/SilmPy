'''Ulmo''' ([[Quenya]], pronounced {{IPA|[ˈulmo]}}) was a [[Valar|Vala]], also known as ''King of the Sea'', ''Lord of Waters'', and ''Dweller of the Deep''.<ref name="UT1">{{UT|1}}</ref> One of the mightiest of the [[Ainur]], he was second in majesty of the [[Aratar]], after [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].

At several points Ulmo was notable for setting himself apart from his brethren, and also for being the friendliest to the [[Children of Eru]].

==Attributes==
Ulmo is the Lord of Waters and King of the Sea.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> He is the Ainu most deeply instructed in music, and it is said that in water the [[Eldar]] hear the echo of the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref> He lives in the deeps under [[Ambar]] who alone has seen where he devises his music and whence he governs all waters, bays and rivers.<ref name=vala/><ref name=s1/>

From the beginning Manwë has been his closest friend and ally and they come together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air, or mists and dew. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.<ref name=ai/>

Ulmo was unique among the Valar in several ways; he was alone, taking no spouse among the [[Valier]]; he didn't dwell in [[Valinor]] but in [[Ekkaia]] from the beginning, preferring the deeps of the seas around and below [[Ambar]], and the rivers. He seldom appeared to the councils of his brethren, save in matters of great importance.<ref name=vala/> 

Likewise, he seldomly wore a [[fana]] but he came to the shores unseen or entered firths of the sea and rivers and it was said his spirit was in the very veins of the world. He spoke through the sound of water, and made music with his horns the [[Ulumúri]]. But whenever he appeared, he was dreadful and terrible "as a mounting wave that strides to the land"; he wore a dark foam-crested helm and a shimmering silver-green mail, and his voice was deep like the ocean.<ref name=vala/>  

Ulmo cared about Arda and the Children of Eru, and through the veins of the world he kept in touch with them and saw every grief and need, and thus knew more of the goings on with them than even Manwë. Even while the Valar were secluded in Valinor or when the Children were under the wrath of his brethren, Ulmo, alone of the Valar, was the one who never forsook them.<ref name=vala/><ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref>

==History==
Ulmo was very close in friendship to Manwë before [[Ea]] was made, and although Manwë was the most dear to [[Ilúvatar]], of all the Ainur Ulmo was most deeply instructed in music. Ulmo with Manwë and [[Aulë]] were the architects of [[Arda]].<ref>{{S|I}}</ref>

He had always distrusted [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. The Dark Lord feared him almost as much as he feared Varda, since the sea cannot be tamed.

When the Valar retreated to [[Valinor]], Ulmo remained to the Outer Sea, and while his brethren neglected the [[Outer Lands]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], Ulmo kept the earth alive under the darkness.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> 

He seldomly came to the Councils of [[Máhanaxar]], but Ulmo defended the Eldar in the council from the potential wrath of [[Mandos]]. 

He opposed [[Oromë]]'s plan to bring the Elves to Aman. But he eventually helped them get to Aman, because he knew that was what they wanted, and he accepted that. He tore a great piece of land off the shores of [[Beleriand]] and used it to transport the Eldar to the blessed coasts of Aman. He anchored the island (it was renamed [[Tol Eressëa]]) in the [[Bay of Eldamar]], which he did because he knew the minds of the [[Teleri]].

When the time came for Melkor to be given a second chance, Ulmo was disappointed when Manwë pardoned Melkor after serving his time in bondage. Ulmo was ever distrustful of Melkor, an opinion shared by Tulkas and Varda.

Ulmo's vassal [[Ossë]], and Ossë's spouse [[Uinen]] were, to the elves, the best known of the [[Maiar]].  Through them Ulmo would learn much of the elves.

During the [[First Age]] Ulmo protected [[Sirion]] and [[Gelion]] and directed more than any other Vala the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]. He urged [[Turgon]] to build [[Gondolin]] and [[Finrod]] to build [[Nargothrond]]. 

He chose [[Tuor]] as his instrument before his birth, by helping [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]] reach [[Gondolin]] and telling [[Turgon]] to accept him, as aid would come from the [[House of Hador]]. Years later, he guided [[Tuor]] directing him to Gondolin as a messenger for Turgon. Despite his warnings, Turgon chose not to abandon Gondolin. Tuor eventually married Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] and fathered [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]]; Ulmo saved [[Elwing]] from the sack of the Havens of [[Sirion]], and thus she took the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] to her husband Eärendil which allowed them to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for their mercy.

==Etymology==
The name ''Ulmo'' is said to derive from the [[Valarin]] '''''Ullubōz'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

Alternatively, Ulmo is a [[Quenya]] title, which means "He who pours" (cf. ''[[ulya-]]'' "to pour" and agentive ending ''[[-mo]]'' "-er").{{fact}}

In the earlier writings his [[Noldorin]] name was '''''[[Ylmir]]''''', among them [[Tuor]]'s ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]''.{{fact}} (Another Noldorin translation of his name is given as '''''Nûron'''''.)<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 378 (entry for NŪ-)</ref><ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 7</ref> The [[Sindarin]] form is ''[[Ulu]]'' ({{IPA|[ˈulu]}}), though he is also called ''Guiar'' ({{IPA|[ˈɡuɪ.ar]}}) and ''Gulma'' ({{IPA|[ˈɡulma]}}).{{fact}}

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Ulmo is referred to by various names: ''Garsecges  frea'' "Ocean ruler", ''ealwaeter-frea'' "All-waters ruler" or ''agendfrea ealra waetera'' "owning lord of all waters".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
His palace, on the bottom of the [[Outer Sea]], was called [[Ulmonan]].<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 270</ref>
