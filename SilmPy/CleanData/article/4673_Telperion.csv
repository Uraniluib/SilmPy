'''Telperion''' ([[Quenya|Q]] pron. {{IPA|[telˈperi.on]}}) was the elder of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], called the '''White Tree''', which shed silver light on the domain of the [[Valar]]. His leaves were of dark green, shining silver beneath, and his boughs were decked with brilliant flowers that shed a rain of silver dew, which was collected as a source of water and of light.<ref name=Days>{{S|Days}}</ref>

==History==
Telperion was the elder of the Two Trees, and bloomed during the first part of the Valian day, followed by [[Laurelin]]. It endured throughout the [[Years of the Trees]], but came to an end in the dreadful [[Darkening of Valinor]]. 

However one of Telperion's flowers survived the Darkening, and was set aloft by the Valar; this was the light of the [[Moon]], carried by [[Tilion]] the [[Maia]].<ref>{{S|11}}</ref>

===Telperion's descendants===
Even though the elder tree did not survive, he was not the last of the White Trees. Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of [[Tirion]] where the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] dwelt together at first. This tree, named ''[[Galathilion]]'', was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was [[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]] on the isle of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{S|5}}</ref>

In the [[Second Age]], a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the [[Númenoreans]] — that was [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], the White Tree of [[Númenor]]. It lasted through the vast majority of the realm's duration, but when [[Sauron]] took control of the island he had king [[Ar-Pharazôn]] chop it down.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

Fortunately [[Isildur]] managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this fruit later came the [[White Tree of Gondor]].

==Etymology==
''Telperion'' comes from ''[[telepi]]'' "silver". The exact etymology of the ending ''-rion'' is not entirely clear, but it can mean something like "great wreathed one" (Cf. ''[[ría]], [[rielle]]'').

The [[Quenya]] form was actually ''Tyelperion'' but Quenya adopted ''[[telpë]]'' from [[Telerin]].<ref>{{UT|6e}}</ref>

==Names==
Another [[Quenya]] name for Telperion was '''Silpion'''<ref>{{MR|P2c}}, p. 59 (commentary to §5)</ref>. The exact meaning of this name is unclear, but it is derived from the root '''[[SIL]]''' "shine (with white or silver light)"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, '''sil-'''</ref> or from the extended root '''[[SILIP]]'''<ref name="SILIP">{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''SIL'''</ref>. It was sometimes glossed the "White Tree of Valinor"<ref name="SILIP">{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''SIL'''</ref>, so "White Tree" is the best available translation.

'''''Ninquelótë''''' was a [[Quenya]] title of Telperion.<ref name=Days/>  ''Ninquelótë'' means "White Flower" or (perhaps more likely in this context) "White Blossom". The [[Sindarin]] equivalent of this Quenya name was [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], and indeed that name was inherited by the White Tree that grew in the [[King's Court]] of [[Númenor]].

'''''Ibrīniðilpathānezel''''' was the name in [[Valarin]] of Telperion.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 401</ref>

In early writings of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] Telperion's names were '''''Silpion''''', '''''Bansil''''' and '''''Belthil'''''.<ref>{{HM|HM}}</ref>
