On [[19 September]] [[1962]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to [[Alina Dadlez]]'''.<ref name=G>{{CG|C}}, p. 598</ref>

*'''Subject:''' Reply to a letter from Dadlez (of [[17 September]]), concerning a translation into Spanish of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (see '''''[[El hobito]]'''''). The Argentinian publishers (in a letter of 14 September<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 1035-6</ref>), commenting on Tolkien's suggestion of the form ''hobitos'', suggest in their turn the form ''jobitos'' (since ''h'' is mute in Spanish). The publishers also write that they "are unable to find the quotation cited by him in the copy of ''The Hobbit'' they are using", concerning ''gnomos''/''gnomes'' (see [[Letter to Alina Dadlez (20 July 1962)]]).<ref name=G/>

==Excerpts==

{{blockquote|I prefer ''hobitos'' since it preserves to the eye more relationship to the original word. I do not much mind the ''h'' being 'mute'; I am sure many [[hobbits]] drop their ''h''s like most rural folk in England.|J.R.R. Tolkien<ref name=RG/>}}

In the words of [[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]], Tolkien also writes that he "gave the wrong reference in ''The Hobbit'' because he had used an older edition".<ref name=G/>
