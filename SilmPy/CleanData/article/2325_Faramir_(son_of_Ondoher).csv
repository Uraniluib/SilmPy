'''Faramir''' was the younger son of King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
When his father and elder brother [[Artamir]] rode to war with the [[Wainriders]], Faramir was supposed to stay in [[Minas Anor]] as regent, according to the custom, as the second in line to the throne.

Not content with that role, Faramir rode out in disguise amongst the [[Éothéod]]. However he was caught with a party of them as they retreated to­wards the [[Dead Marshes]]. The [[Leader of the Éothéod]] came to their rescue, but Faramir died in his arms. After he searched his body he found out that the dead soldier was the Prince of Gondor. 

The Leader went to join [[Minohtar]] at the head of the [[North Road]] in [[Ithilien]].  Minohtar was preparing a message to be taken to the prince when he learned the news that the prince had been killed in battle.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>
