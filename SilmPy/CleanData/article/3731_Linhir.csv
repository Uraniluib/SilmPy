'''Linhir''' was a town in southern [[Gondor]], at the juncture of the River [[Gilrain]] and the River [[Serni]], north of the [[Ethir Anduin|Mouths of Anduin]]. Through it passed the road from [[Pelargir]] to [[Ethring]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

[[Angbor]], the Lord of [[Lamedon]], was here attacked by the [[Haradrim]] and [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. On [[11 March]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Aragorn]] and the [[Grey Company]] arrived at the town<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> (with, of course, the [[Oathbreakers|Army of the Dead]]). Terror came upon their assailants and they fled. The Men of Lamedon fled as well; all save the stout-hearted Angbor. Eventually the Corsairs were driven back to [[Pelargir]], where they were defeated.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:As in the book, Linhir was a city in the region of Central [[Gondor]]. It straddled the rivers [[Serni]] and [[Gilrain]] just past their confluence and therefore was built in both [[Dor-en-Ernil]] and Lower [[Lebennin]], but was mainly considered part of the former. Three brothers, "Erchar", "Garvir", and "Herion", sons of the late "Comeldir", commanded the soldiers of Linhir following [[Aragorn]]'s passage. The brothers were commanded to defend the city, but Erchar and Herion instead attacked the enemy forces in Dor-en-Ernil, resulting in the deaths of many of their men. The brothers were later convinced to return, and when both sides recovered from the terror of the [[Oathbreakers]] the remaining [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] and [[Haradrim]] launched a second attack. The Gondorians were again victorious but suffered heavy losses.
