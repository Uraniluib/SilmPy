The '''Ringló''' ([[Sindarin|S.]]"cold fenland") was an important river of the central regions of [[Gondor]]. It arose in the [[White Mountains]] in a valley in the eastern part of [[Lamedon]] and flowed south-west for some 200 miles<ref name="RKmap">{{RK|Map}}</ref> before joining the [[Morthond]]<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> near [[Cobas Haven]].<ref name="Map2">{{WR|3|XIV}}, West</ref> The [[Ciril]] was a major tributary of the Ringló that entered it from the north.<ref name="RKmap"/>

==History==
Near the confluence of the Ringló and the Morthond was the ancient Elf-haven of [[Edhellond]]. This refuge had been founded at the beginning of the [[Second Age]] by a remnant of [[Elves]] from [[Doriath]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ''Amroth and Nimrodel''</ref> When first discovered by the [[Númenóreans]] the river was named ''Ringnen'' ("cold water"); later changed to Ringló when its upper reaches were explored.

After the founding of [[Gondor]], the Ringló served as the boundary between [[Anfalas]] to the west and [[Belfalas]] to the east.<ref name="RKmap"/>

At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] the lord of [[Ringló Vale]] was [[Dervorin]]. His son marched to [[Minas Tirith]] with a company of three hundred men to aid in the city's defence.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> On [[10 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], the [[Grey Company]], and the [[Oathbreakers|Army of the Dead]] crossed the Ringló on their way from [[Erech]] to [[Pelargir]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Ringló'' was composed of the elements ''Ring'', meaning "cold, chill",<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''ring''</ref> and ''ló'' (earlier ''loga''), meaning "fenland".<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> The second element referred to the fact that at its source the Ringló came from a shallow lake fed by a high snowfield in the White Mountains.<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Ringló''</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The course and placement of the Ringló varied greatly as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In the First Map of [[Middle-earth]] the Ringló flowed to the sea and the Morthond was set well west of it (and [[Dol Amroth]] was far to the west of both).<ref>{{TI|MIII}}</ref> When he developed Outline VI for Book V in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' he drew a map that showed the Morthond east of the Ringló and the Ringló mostly flowed south to the Sea.<ref>{{WR|3|II}}</ref> When Tolkien made the detailed Second Map there were four rivers – [[Calenhir]], Morthond, Kiril (later Ciril), and Ringló – that flowed independently until they all met just before exiting into Cobas Haven.<ref name="Map2"/>
