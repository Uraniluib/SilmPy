'''Orofarnë''' was one of the [[rowans]] of [[Fangorn Forest]], much beloved by the [[Ents|Ent]] [[Quickbeam|Bregalad]]. It was cut down by [[Orcs]] of [[Isengard]], arousing the anger of this impulsive Ent.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>
==Etymology==
In a letter, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explained that ''orofarne'' means "mountain-dwelling" in High-elven ([[Quenya]]).<ref>{{L|168}}</ref> In another manuscript he glossed ''Orofarnë'' as "mountain ash", consisting of the [[Quenya]] elements ''[[Oron#Quenya|oro-]]'' ("hill") + ''farnë?/pharne'' ("any growing thing or plant").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 83</ref>

Editors [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] have made a connection between the [[Qenya]] word ''farne'' ("foliage"; a derivative of the [[Sundocarme|root]] PHAS-, also appearing under the rejected [[Sundocarme|root]] PHARAN-) and the name ''Orofarnë''.<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 9</ref>
