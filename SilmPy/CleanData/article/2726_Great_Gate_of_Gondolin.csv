The '''Great Gate of Gondolin''' was the [[Seventh Gate]] said to have been added to the existing six gates of [[Gondolin]] by [[Maeglin]], after [[Morgoth]]'s victory in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. According to legend, the gate was made of steel and seven stories high, but inconsistencies between accounts mean that its existence cannot be considered certain.
