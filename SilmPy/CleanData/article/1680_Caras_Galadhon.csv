{{Pronounce|Caras Galadhon.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Caras Galadhon''' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkaras ˈɡalaðon]}}) was the city and fortress of the [[Galadhrim]] of [[Lothlórien]].<ref name=FR-II6>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

==Overview==
Caras Galadhon was in the [[Naith]] of Lothlórien, in the [[Angle (Lothlórien)|angle]] between the rivers [[Celebrant]] and [[Anduin]] known as [[Egladil]].<ref name=FR-II6/>

The city was located on a green hill  surrounded by a fosse and a wall whose gates lay to the south-west. The inhabitants dwelt in large [[Telain|flets]] in the trees, reached by white ladders. On the top of the hill, in the greatest of trees, were the house of Celeborn and Galadriel.<ref name=FR-II6/> In the same tree were the highest point in the land.<ref name=UT-6>{{UT|6}}</ref>

==History==
The city was founded in the second millennium of the [[Third Age]] due to the growing threat of [[Dol Guldur]].<ref name=UT-6/> 

During the events of the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] was brought through Lothlórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the lords of the [[Galadhrim]]. They stayed in the city for a month, recovering from their journey through [[Moria]].

In the [[Fourth Age]], after Galadriel had gone into the [[Straight Road|West]], Caras Galadhon was ruled by a lonely Celeborn as capital of a Lothlórien which now spanned both sides of the river [[Anduin]]. Later Celeborn left for [[Valinor]] as well, and Caras Galadhon became an empty place.

==Etymology==
The name ''Caras Galadhon'' is said to be [[Silvan Elvish]].<ref name=UT-6/>. However the word ''[[caras]]'' is also attested as [[Sindarin]].

''Galadhon'' can be interpreted as genitive plural "of trees", showing a case ending not existing in Sindarin but known from [[Quenya]]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s earliest version of Sindarin, called [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]], also possessed this ending. In that case Caras Galadhon means "moated fortress of the trees".

The name could also refer in some way to [[Galadhon]], whom Tolkien conceived to be the father of [[Celeborn]]. In that case the name would mean *"Galadhon's fortress".

==Errors==
In the first edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Caras Galadhon was misspelled "Caras Galadon".

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''
:A view of Caras Galadhon from [[Cerin Amroth]] is only present in the Extended Edition. The Fellowship's stay in the city is a significant portion of the film.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Caras Galadhon scenes are rather brief, mostly limited to the Mirror of Galadriel scene.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Caras Galadhon is the main inhabited area in Lothlorien, where players cannot enter until they prove their friendship to Galadhrim. The map and general layout of the city is replicated from the map in [[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]. The city hosts most major gameplay facilities and is composed of a large number of flets on different levels, connected by multiple ladders and staircases. It is rather hard to navigate and thus several quests consist solely of directing the player to various point of interest, then challenging him to find them again. The Company Pavilion, Galadriel's Garden and the House of Celeborn are also located there.
