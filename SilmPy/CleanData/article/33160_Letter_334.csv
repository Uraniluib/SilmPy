==Summary==
Tolkien was grateful for [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner's]] assistance, for himself, [[John Tolkien]], and [[Priscilla Tolkien]].<ref group="note">Tolkien received the [[Wikipedia:Order of the British Empire|C.B.E.]] at Buckingham Palace on 28 March 1972.  Rayner honoured him with a dinner at the Garrick Club and [[Allen and Unwin]] had arranged their stay at Brown's Hotel in London.</ref>  He enjoyed the party, the hotel accommodation were excellent, and when it rained at 6 a.m. he knew that it would clear up later for the occasion.  The ceremonies inside the Palace had been a little tedious and comic, but Tolkien had been deeply moved by his brief meeting with the Queen.

Tolkien asked if Rayner would use Tolkien's Christian name since they were now very old and dear friends.
