'''Silmo''', an [[Ainur|Ainu]] only appearing in the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]], was appointed guardian of the tree [[Telperion|Silpion]] — to be "ever mindful" of the watering of the tree. For this task, he was chosen by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Irmo|Lórien]], who loved the youthful Silmo.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 73-4</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] has suggested that the [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Tilion]] (a later creation) "perhaps owes something to the figure of Silmo".<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 88</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Silmo'' is a [[Qenya]] name. His name in [[Gnomish]] was '''''Thilim''''' (containing the masculine ending ''-im'').<ref>{{PE|14}}, pp. 12-3</ref>
