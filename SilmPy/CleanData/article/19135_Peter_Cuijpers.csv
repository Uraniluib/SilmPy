'''Peter Cuijpers''' ([[1944]]) is a Dutch translator, who has translated works of Robin Hobb, Fiona MacIntosh and many others.  After the death of [[Max Schuchart]] in [[2005]], a new translator was needed for ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''. Cuijpers had already translated several photo books about the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|movie]] franchise, and was deemed the best option by Mynx publishers. His ''De kinderen van Húrin'' was presented on [[28 April|April 28]], [[2007]].

Cuijpers did not follow Schuchart's translation of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' save on [[translated names]].
