'''The Wild''' was an untamed, dangerous region of [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref> Its boundaries are somewhat indefinite, but it seems to have been approximately equivalent to the region of  [[Rhovanion]], although in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' memoirs a map showed the [[Edge of the Wild]] west of [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref>
