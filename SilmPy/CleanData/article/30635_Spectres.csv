'''Spectres''' were evil creatures only mentioned fleetingly in linguistic writings.<ref>{{HM|LRI}} (entry for ''[[dwimmerlaik]]'')</ref><ref>{{PE|19}}, pp. 17, 101 (footnote 155; cf. [[Sundocarme|root]] [[NASAG]])</ref> Likely ''spectre'' was just another name for [[undead]] beings such as [[ghosts]] or [[wraiths]].

Perhaps spectres were related to the [[Sindarin]] concept ''[[auth]]'' ([[Quenya]] ''[[ausa]]''), referring to a spectral apparition.<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 9</ref>
