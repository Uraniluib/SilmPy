'''Sûza''' is the [[Westron]] word for "province, sphere of occupation, division of a realm"<ref>{{HM|AF}}</ref>, visible in '''Sûza-t''', "[[The Shire]]". 
==Etymology==
Perhaps the second element ''-za'' related to the [[Adûnaic]] word ''[[zâyan]]'', "land"<ref>Andreas Möhn, "[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html Etymologies of the Atani languages]", entry ZAY'N</ref>.

==Inspiration==
<blockquote>'' "[...] actually the ON [[Old Norse]] and mod. Icelandic ''sýsla<ref>{{WP|Sýsla}}</ref>>'' (Swed. ''syssla'', Dan. ''syssel'', now obsolete in sense ''amt'', but occurring in place-names) was in mind when I said that the real untranslated name of the Shire was ''Súza'' [...] hence it was also said [...] that it was a 'district of well-ordered ''business'''."'' <ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 775 (entry for ''Shire'')</ref></blockquote>
