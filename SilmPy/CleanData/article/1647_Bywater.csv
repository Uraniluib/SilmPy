'''Bywater''' was a village in the [[Westfarthing]] of [[the Shire]], north of the [[East Road]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> It housed the [[Green Dragon]] inn and its residents included the [[Cotton Family]] and [[Old Noakes]].

The village was by the [[Bywater Pool]] with most of its holes and houses on the south bank by the road, the northernmost of which was The Green Dragon. On the north bank of the Pool there was a row of [[Smials]] with water-side gardens.  From the middle of the village, [[South Lane]] led to Cottonâ€™s farm. South from the East Road ran the road north to [[Hobbiton]], lined by an avenue of trees. The village had its own post office.

In {{TA|3018}}, the Shire was taken over by [[Saruman]] and his [[Ruffians]]. A year later many houses in Bywater stood empty and some had even been burnt. At the return of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions, Bywater became the centre of the rebellion which ultimately ended with the [[Battle of Bywater]] and the liberation of the Shire.
