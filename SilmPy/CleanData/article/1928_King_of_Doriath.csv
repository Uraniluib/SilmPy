The '''King of Doriath''' was the title of two Elf-lords of the [[Sindar]], who ruled the kingdom of [[Doriath]] for many centuries from its foundation long before the beginning of the [[First Age]] to its destruction at the hands of the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. The Kings of Doriath were at the same time the High Kings of the Sindar.

'''[[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]''' The founder of Doriath with his queen, [[Melian]]. He was lord there for millennia, and in that time his realm was protected from foes by the [[Girdle of Melian]]. Thingol was slain by [[Dwarves]] in approximately I 502, and Melian departed from the realm. He was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter [[Lúthien]]. 

'''[[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]]''' After Thingol's death he came to [[Menegroth]] and ruled the kingdom of his grandfather. Because Dior's treasuries held a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]], the Sons of Fëanor assailed the citadel of Menegroth to recover it. There Dior was slain, and the kingdom ended.
