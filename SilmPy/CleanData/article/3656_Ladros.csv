'''Ladros''' was a highland region to the northeast of [[Dorthonion]]. It was held briefly as a fief by the [[House of Bëor]], but lost to [[Morgoth]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame").
==History==
The region of Ladros seems originally to have been a fief of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] (at least, his brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] held "the northern slopes of Dorthonion"<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>). Finrod later assigned this land to [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)|Boromir]] of the House of Bëor, whose members had long been loyal in his service. Boromir became [[Lord of Ladros]].

Of the House of Bëor, there were three lords of Ladros — Boromir himself, his son [[Bregor]], and Bregor's son [[Bregolas]]. In Bregolas' time, Morgoth overwhelmed Dorthonion and Ladros in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], in which Bregolas himself was slain. His brother [[Barahir]] and [[Barahir's Outlaw Band|twelve faithful men]], became outlaws in their own land, assaulting Morgoth's forces from their hidden lair at [[Tarn Aeluin]] on Ladros' southern borders. They were betrayed by [[Gorlim the Unhappy]],(who was himself deceived by Sauron into divulging the Outlaws' whereabouts.) and all were slain but [[Beren]], who escaped into the south. 

After this time, Ladros fell under the yoke of Morgoth until it was swallowed by the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] at the end of the [[First Age]].
