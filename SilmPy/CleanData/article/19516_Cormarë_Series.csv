The '''''Cormarë Series''''' is a series of scholarly books and essays by [[Walking Tree Publishers]]. The series is named after ''[[Cormarë]]'', or "Ring-day", [[22 September|September 22]]th. This name was chosen because the initiative for this series came on the 10th anniversity of the Swiss [[Tolkien Societies|Tolkien Society]] ''[[Eredain]]'' (founders of Walking Tree Publishers), who named their Anniversary meetings (in 1996, 2001 and 2006) "Cormarë", even though it fell on [[25 March|March 25]].
