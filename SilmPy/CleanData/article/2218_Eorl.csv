'''Eorl the Young''' ([[Third Age]] 2485 – 2545, aged 60 years) was the son of [[Léod]] of the [[Éothéod]], and founder of [[Rohan]].<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Life==
When Eorl was only 16 years old, his father was killed while trying to tame [[Felaróf]], making Eorl [[Lord of the Éothéod]] at that young age. Young Eorl swore to avenge his father and managed to tame him. He "doomed" the horse to carry him for the rest of their lives, and the horse seemingly accepted this burden.<ref name="Eorl"/>

In {{TA|2510}}, [[Borondir|Borondir Udalraph]] came to the north seeking aid, as the [[South-kingdom]] was attacked by the [[Orcs]] and the [[Balchoth]]. On April 15th, Eorl came to the [[Field of Celebrant]], and joined the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|battle]]. For his service to [[Gondor]], he was granted [[Calenardhon]] to dwell in. As a return, Eorl and his descendants would have to come to the aid of Gondor when they requested; this was known as the [[Oath of Eorl]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

Eorl ruled from a green hill under the [[White Mountains]].<ref name="Eorl"/>

Even in his older years Eorl never lost his yellow hair. He died in battle against the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|2545}}. He was buried in the first royal mound, and Felaróf was buried with him.<ref name="Mark"/> 
==Legacy==
Eorl was the founder of Rohan, its first King, the ancestor of the [[House of Eorl]] and all the [[Kings of Rohan]]. His horse Felaróf was the first of the [[Mearas]].

Eorl was known as "the Young" because he became [[Lord of the Éothéod]] at the age of 16 and because he never lost his yellow hair.

His Oath would be answered at least twice: once by [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], and once by [[Théoden|Théoden Ednew]].<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''Eorl''' is an Old English word that can be roughly translated as "one of the nobility, earl". It was the highest of the ranks in North Germanic culture, not introduced to Britain until the late 9th century. The title was known as ''jarl'' in Old Norse,<ref>[[Wikipedia:Jarl in Sweden|Jarl in Sweden]] at [[wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]] </ref> and because of that, the [[Þórsteinn Thorarensen]] used this throughout his Icelandic translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', along with [[Helm|Hjálmur]], [[Thengel|Þengill]], [[Théoden|Þjódan]] and [[Éomer|Jómar]].<ref>[[Arden R. Smith]], ''Transitions in Translations: Upphaflega íslensk heiti'', published in [[Vinyar Tengwar 42]], pages 35-37</ref>

:Compare ''[[Ceorl]]'', the second rank.
