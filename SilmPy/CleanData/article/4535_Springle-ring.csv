The '''Springle-ring''' was a dance of the [[Shire-hobbits]]. It was described as "a pretty dance, but rather vigorous" where dancers leaped up often.<ref name=Party>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

At the [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] the dance was performed by [[Everard Took]] and [[Melilot Brandybuck]].<ref name=Party/> The dance is also mentioned in the [[Buckland]]ish poem ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]'', witnessed by the daughters of [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref>{{AB|Boating}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The word ''[[Wiktionary:springle#English|springle]]'' has several meanings in English, however [[Tolkien]] commented that the name is made-up, ought to evoke the style of the dance.<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] gives the erroneous translation "war-horse ring".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 363</ref><ref>Cf. [http://forums.theonering.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=79495&start=30 Forum discussion]: "...although where this information proceeds from is not given ('springle' does not seem to be a synonym for 'war-horse' in any online dictionary)."</ref>
