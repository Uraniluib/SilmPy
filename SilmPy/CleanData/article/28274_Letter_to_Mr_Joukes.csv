On [[28 August]] [[1967]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|a letter]] to Mr S.E.O. Joukes''' (apparently a native of the Netherlands<ref>[[Ren√© van Rossenberg]], ''[[Hobbits in Holland|Hobbits in Holland: Leven en werk van JRR Tolkien (1892-1973)]]'', p. 36</ref><ref>[[User talk:Ederchil#Dutch name]], as of 30 August 2010</ref>). 

*'''Contents:''' Mr. Joukes wants to name his daughter ''[[Ioreth]]'', but Tolkien writes that it means 'old woman' in Elvish (Tolkien also notes that the name probably does not occur outside ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). Furthermore, Tolkien writes about the translation of the name ''[[Arwen]]''.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 706</ref>
*'''Publication:''' ''[[Hobbits in Holland|Hobbits in Holland: Leven en werk van JRR Tolkien (1892-1973)]]''. An excerpt was also published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' (p. 68).

== Excerpt ==

"[''Arwen''] means in Elvish 'noble maiden', but ... it is also a word in [[Welsh]] meaning 'greatly blessed'"
