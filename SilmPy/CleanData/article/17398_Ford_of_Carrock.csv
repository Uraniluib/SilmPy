The '''Ford of [[Carrock]]''' was, according to [[Glóin]]'s words in [[Rivendell]], a ford that the [[Beornings]] kept open for high tolls during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> 

==Theories==
It is not clear exactly what the Ford of Carrock is. In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Thorin and Company]] traverse a small ford made of "huge flat stones" that connected only the [[Carrock]] with "the grass-land beyond the stream" at the eastern bank of the river. According to [[Gandalf]] "it is easy enough [...] to get from [the eastern] bank to the Carrock by ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel." Gandalf could not cross the river there when he was following the track of [[Beorn]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> 

This small ford remains unnamed (without capitals) in ''The Hobbit'' and it is not clear if the "Ford of Carrock" mentioned by Glóin in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' refers to that ford. [[Robert Foster]] supposed that Glóin's reference should be to the [[Old Ford]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, s.v. ''Ford of Carrock''</ref>
