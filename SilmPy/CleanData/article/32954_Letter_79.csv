==Summary==
[[Wikipedia:Kroonstad|Kroonstad]], said Tolkien, was a real product of current English culture.  [[Wikipedia:Johannesburg|Johannesburg]] is what it would like to be.  Tolkien predicted that in twenty years England would have many Kroonstads, architecturally, morally, and mentally, a landscape blistered with rotting tin mushrooms with nothing else forthcoming.  As before, the Christian Church would have to carry alone the tradition of higher mental civilization, if not driven into new catacombs.  Gloomy thoughts, mused Tolkien, when actually the future was impenetrable, especially to the wise.  The really important was always hidden from contemporaries.  The seeds of what is to be germinated quietly in the dark while everyone was looking at Stalin or Hitler.

After morning lecture Tolkien had found the local pub closed, but hailed by the two Lewises<ref group="note">[[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Warren Lewis]]</ref> and [[Charles Williams|C. Williams]], they found satisfaction at the Kingâ€™s Arms.  Tolkien closed the letter by describing the most marvelous sunset he had seen in years.
