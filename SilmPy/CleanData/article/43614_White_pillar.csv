The '''White Pillar''' was a monument erected upon the highest hill of the headland overlooking [[Umbar]]. The great pillar was white with a crystal globe set on top. The globe absorbed the rays of the [[Sun]] or the [[Moon]] and shone like a star that could, in clear weather, be seen far out to sea or even upon the south coasts of [[Gondor]].<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
In {{SA|3261}} the [[Númenórean]] King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] landed at Umbar and humbled the might of [[Sauron]].<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> Although Ar-Pharazôn's reign represented the darkest times of [[Númenor]], culminating in disaster, [[Elendil]] and his exiled followers remembered the landing with pride; they erected the White Pillar in memory of the event, commemorating the power of their race, and the humiliation of the Dark Lord.

At the end of the [[Kin-strife]] between the factions of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] and [[Castamir]], the sons of the usurper sailed with their followers from [[Pelargir]] to [[Umbar]] in {{TA|1448}}, removing the city from Gondor's control.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> After Umbar fell under the domination of Sauron's servants the memorial of his humiliation was destroyed.<ref name="Gondor"/>
