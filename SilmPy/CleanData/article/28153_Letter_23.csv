== Summary ==
The publishers were again considering the publication of ''[[Mr Bliss]]'', which had previously languished due to the complexity of the illustrations<ref group="note">Discussed in [[Letter 10]].</ref>, but Tolkien did not feel he had the time to undertake redrawing them.

He lamented that he had not managed to progress past the first chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', remarking:
{{blockquote|They say it is the first step that costs the effort. I do not find it so. I am sure I could write unlimited 'first chapters'. I have indeed written many.}}
