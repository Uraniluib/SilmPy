The doors that guarded the entrance to [[Nargothrond]], raised by its builder [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. They were set in the face of a cliff above the river Narog, and approached only by a narrow pathway across the cliff, making Nargothrond secure from enemy attack. 

After Felagund's death, [[TÃºrin]] came to dwell in Nargothrond, and he persuaded King [[Orodreth]] to change this secretive policy, and to build a great bridge before the Doors of Felagund, so that his armies could more easily pass across the [[Narog]]. This was a dire error, because it gave [[Morgoth]]'s forces a means to approach the Doors. After the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], [[Glaurung]] the Dragon came against the Doors of Felagund and destroyed them, allowing the [[Orcs]] to sack the once-mighty citadel.
