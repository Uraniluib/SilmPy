'''''Songs for the Philologists''''' is a collection of poems by [[E.V. Gordon]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] as well as traditional songs. It is the rarest and most difficult to find Tolkien related book. Originally a collection of typescripts compiled by Gordon in [[1921]]–[[1926]] for the students of [[Leeds University]], it was given by [[A.H. Smith]] of University College London, a former student at Leeds, to a group of students to be printed privately in 1935 or 1936, and printed in [[1936]] with the impressuum "Printed by G. Tillotson, A.H. Smith, B. Pattison and other members of the English Department, University College, London". The booklet was printed in hand-set type as an exercise on a reconstructed wooden hand-press.

Since Smith had not asked permission of either Gordon or Tolkien, the printed booklets were not distributed. Most copies were destroyed in the ensuing fire when the University College was bombed during the Second World War, and only a few, perhaps around 14, survived.
