==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the introduction to ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that they were written in the 1930s.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, p, 3</ref>  This work was laid aside while [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote ''The Lord of the Rings'', after which he returned to his work on the elder days.  In his later writings Tolkien relocated the coming of the [[Edain]] over the [[Blue Mountains]] nearly a century earlier, which occasioned a large-scale overhaul of the chronology and genealogies.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''The new genealogies of the Edain''</ref>

In the older ''Grey Annals'' Bëor was followed by his sons [[Bregolas]] and [[Barahir]]. In the new version four generations (''Baran'', Boron, Boromir, and Bregor) were inserted after Bëor, with Bregor the father of Bregolas and Barahir.<ref name="WJBeor">{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor''</ref>
