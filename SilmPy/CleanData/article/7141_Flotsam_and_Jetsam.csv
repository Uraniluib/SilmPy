'''Flotsam and Jetsam''' is the ninth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] told [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] how they had come to be at [[Isengard]] after escaping the [[Orcs]] and being helped by [[Ents]]. Merry told them how the whole forest had marched to Isengard and torn up the gates. Pippin then told them how [[Saruman]] had almost managed to escape but had been spotted in time and taken refuge in the stronghold of [[Orthanc]] that even the iron-tearing ents could not destroy. He also told them how [[Gandalf]] had come by and asked for [[Treebeard]]'s help, which he had given. Pippin told them how [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had come to give Saruman a message, but seeing the destruction he had wanted to leave. At that point Treebeard had captured him and that was how he had come to be cloistered with Saruman.
