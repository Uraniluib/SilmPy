'''Telerin''' was a word used to refer to the tongues of any Elf-people that are of [[Lindar]] origin but is best reserved for the language of the Teleri that came to [[Valinor]], the [[Falmari]]<ref>{{PE|18}}, p.77</ref>; it is a tongue related to both [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]].

It is also called '''''Lindalambe''''' or '''''Lindárin'''''.
==History==
The language of the Falmari descended from [[Common Telerin]], an ancient dialect of the [[Common Eldarin]] spoken during the [[Great March]]. From the viewpoint of the speakers of [[Quenya]] (who considered their language the main direct descendant of Common Eldarin), they considered Telerin (a direct descendant of Common Telerin) a "dialect of Quenya". Telerin was therefore considered a closely related language still largely intelligible.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}</ref> 

However, the phonology of the two languages differed much, with Telerin often being more conservative than [[Quenya]]. In [[Aman]] the speakers of Telerin outnumbered the speakers of [[Quenya]], much as the [[Teleri]] outnumbered the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]]. 

The coexistence with the Teleri, made the Noldor to differientate themselves from the [[Vanyarin|speech of the Vanyar]]. For example the Vanyar pronounced /f/ very soft, almost like /hw/, but the Noldor resisted this change through influence from the Teleri.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> 

Also, the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor who seemed to prefer the Telerin word ''[[telpe]]'' "silver" intead the Quenya form ''[[tyelpë]]''.<ref>{{UT|6e}}</ref>

[[Finarfin]] is said to have learned Telerin. He also gave his sons Telerin-influenced Quenya names.

==Grammar==
A notable difference from Quenya was that the possessive endings were suffixed to a word of something possessed, not possessing. For example "[[Olwe]]'s house" is ''[[cava]]ria Olue'' (lit. house-his Olue).{{fact}}

==Other versions==
''Telerin'' is a name of a language appearing in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', where about 25 words of that language are given.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> This version of Telerin was more related to [[Ilkorin]] than to [[Qenya]] or [[Kornoldorin]].{{fact}}
