'''Faramir's defense of Osgiliath''' was a futile attempt to stem the advance of Sauron's army advancing from [[Minas Morgul]] towards [[Minas Tirith]] through the ruins of the city on the [[Anduin]].
==Prelude==
[[10 March|Two days]] after the departure of [[Frodo Baggins]] from [[Henneth Ann√ªn]], [[Faramir]] barely returned to [[Minas Tirith]] from Osgiliath (he was almost caught by [[Fell beasts]] until [[Gandalf]] saved him).<ref name="App">{{App|Great}}</ref>   

Early in the morning of [[11 March|the next day]] [[Denethor]] ordered his son back to Osgiliath, hoping to make the Enemy pay dearly for the crossing of the river. Despite his warnings that [[Sauron]] could easily afford to lose ten times [[Gondor]]'s losses, and that those so far afield would find retreat perilous, Denethor insisted that Faramir defend the ruined city because no army could cross the river north of [[Cair Andros]] or southwards towards [[Lebennin]].  After the meeting of the Council Faramir took what strength he could to Osgiliath.<ref name="Osgiliath">{{RK|V4}}</ref>

==The Battle==
On 12 March, {{TA|3019}},<ref name="App"/> Sauron's army met and shoved Faramir's scratch forces west out of Osgiliath.  Although the Enemy did pay dearly for the crossing, it was less than hoped.  In secret, numerous floats and barges had been built in East Osgiliath which allowed Sauron's forces to swarm like beetles upon the defenders.<ref name="Osgiliath"/>
==Aftermath==
Faramir retired with his men to the [[Causeway Forts]] where the ongoing battle resumed.  Soon this battle would also be lost, Faramir was struck down by the [[Black Breath]]. Only a sortie by [[Imrahil]] and his knights saved him and the rest of the wounded from that onset.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> Sauron's army advanced and [[siege of Gondor]] would begin.
==Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''

:Orcs, led by [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]], swarm across the Anduin and engage Faramir's garrison throughout the ruins of western Osgiliath. When his forces begin to be overwhelmed and the city is clearly lost, he leads a retreat back to Minas Tirith, harried by the Ringwraiths along the way. Denethor then delusionally orders Faramir to lead a counter-attack to retake Osgiliath, despite Faramir's complaint that the city is completely overrun. The [[Pelennor Fields]] are not protected by the [[Rammas Echor]] and there are no [[Causeway Forts]] on the road between Osgiliath and Minas Tirith.
