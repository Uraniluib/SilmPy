==Summary==
Unspecified troubles led to the edge of a breakdown for Tolkien and he had been ordered by a doctor to rest.  When he wrote this letter he had already done nothing for a week or two and was beginning to feel better.  On 1 September he was going away for a fortnight’s holiday (which he had not planned and could not afford) for his and his youngest son’s health.

He had gotten ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' typed and now submitted it to Allen and Unwin for their consideration, although he admitted it was not long enough for stand-alone publication.  Tolkien stated that he had planned out a sequel and that he had another unfinished story called ''[[The King of the Green Dozen]]''; he offered to finish them off to accompany ''Farmer Giles'' if desired.<ref group="note"> Neither story, the sequel to ''Farmer Giles of Ham'' nor ''The King of the Green Dozen'', were ever completed.</ref>

Tolkien said that he had begun again on the sequel to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' – ''The Lord of the Ring''<ref group="note">In this letter the word “Ring” was not yet plural.</ref>.  It was flowing along and had gotten quite out of hand.  Tolkien had reached about Chapter VII and it was progressing towards quite unforeseen goals.  He felt that it was better than its predecessor and mentioned that [[C.S. Lewis]] professed himself more than pleased.  However, he warned Allen and Unwin, “it is no bed-time story”.
