The '''Brown Lands''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] '''''Berennyr'''''<ref name=rc/><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]|articleurl=http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/readers_by_date.html|articlename=Addenda and Corrigenda to ''The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion'' (2005, 2008, 2014) Arranged by Date|dated=|website=HS|accessed=03-08-2015}}</ref>) or '''Noman-lands''' was a region east of the [[Anduin]] between [[Mirkwood]] to the north and the [[Emyn Muil]] to the south.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>  

The area was the home of the [[Entwives]] who made their gardens there; but during the [[War of the Last Alliance]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], they were driven away when [[Sauron]] ruined the land against the advance of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Allies]] down the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> Thenceforth the area became a desolate desert with arid moors.<ref>{{TT|Marshes}}</ref> The [[Ents]] vainly had crossed the Anduin in search of the [[Entwives]]. [[Treebeard]] appeared convinced that the Entwives were not all destroyed but were "lost".<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

Even by the end of the [[Third Age]], when the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] drifted by in boats upon the Great River, they saw only long, formless slopes with a withered look, without trees or even grass.  What had caused such desolation not even [[Aragorn]] could tell.<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] describes in his unfinished index (for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') the ''Brown Lands'' as a 'translation' of '''''Berennyr''''' (a pluralized compound of [[Sindarin]] ''[[baran (Sindarin)|baran]]'' 'brown, yellow-brown' and ''[[dôr]]'' 'land') "a devastated region, east of [[Anduin]], between [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] and the [[Emyn Muil]]".<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. 343 (quoting from the manuscript "[[Index questions]]")</ref>
