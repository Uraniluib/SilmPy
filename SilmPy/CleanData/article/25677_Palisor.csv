'''Palisor''' was a name used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in his early legendarium for the mid-most region of the [[Great Lands]]. In Palisor lay the [[Cuivi√©nen|Waters of Awakening]], where the Elves awoke.<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, p. 114f</ref>

The [[Dark Elves]] stayed back in Palisor, and in the unfinished [[Gilfanon's Tale]] we learn that the [[Hisildi]] were ruled by the [[sprites|fay]] [[Tu]], whose dwelling was in the caves below the Waters of Awakening. East of Palisor was the [[Murmenalda]] where the [[Men]] awoke.

In the outlines of that story, Palisor was the site of the [[Battle of Palisor]], where Elves and Men fought against [[Fankil]]'s [[Dwarves]] and/or [[goblins]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>
==Conceptual confusion==

In ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index]]'', Palisor is correctly described as the region where "the Elves awoke", in the index for ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. However, in the index for ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Palisor is described to be the region where "the first Men awoke". A misconception is likely to have entered the index, as none of the page references point to any other usage of the name Palisor than the birth-place of the Elves.

==Etymology==

According to [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s reading of the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', 'Palisor' is derived from the root PALA, "whose derivatives have a common general sense of 'flatness', among them ''palis'' 'sward, lawn', whence no doubt ''Palisor''."<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, p. 264</ref>
