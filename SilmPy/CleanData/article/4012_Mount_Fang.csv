'''Mount Fang''' is a picturesque name for [[Orthanc]], the citadel of the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]. 'Mount Fang' translates Orthanc's name as if it were [[Elvish]], but the meaning 'Cunning Mind' was also possible if the name is interpreted in the old language of the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>
