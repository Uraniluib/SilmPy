'''Kirinki''' was one of the many species of birds found in [[Númenor]], and doubtless [[Aman]], that were not known in [[Middle-earth]]. The kirinki were said to be smaller than wrens, with bright scarlet feathers, and voices so high that they could hardly be heard by [[Men]].<ref>{{UT|3}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The meaning of ''kirinki'' is unknown. Perhaps it is a [[Quenya]] word,<ref>"[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/16420 Kirinki (July 25, 2002)]" (and related messages) at the [[Elfling|Elfling mailing list]] (accessed 13 March 2011)</ref> seemingly incorporating the diminutive ending ''-incë''.<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist]" at [[Ardalambion]] (accessed 13 March 2011)</ref>
