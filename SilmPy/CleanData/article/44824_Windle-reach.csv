'''Windle-reach''' was a lower part of the [[Withywindle]] river beginning at the [[Withy-weir]] straight up to the [[Grindwall]].<ref>{{ATB|2}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The word "[[Wikipedia:Reach (geography)|reach]]" can refer to any length of a river or to a level stretch between locks in a canal, but especially to "a straight portion of a stream or river, as from one turn to another"<ref>[http://water.usgs.gov/wsc/glossary.html#R General Introduction and Hydrologic Definitions] (Science in Your Watershed, U.S. Geological Survey).</ref> which is here the most probable explanation, as it gives a word-play combining ''windle'' 'winding' and ''reach'' 'straight'.<ref>See also: [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/w/windlereach.html Windle-reach] (Encyclopedia of Arda).</ref>
