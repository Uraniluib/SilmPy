'''Eämbar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈambar]}}) was a ship built by [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] to act as headquarters for the [[Guild of Venturers]]. It was a massive ship, designed to be more of a dwelling-place than a sailing vessel. Originally anchored off the island of [[Tol Uinen]] in the bay of [[Rómenna]], it was later moved to the ports of [[Andúnië]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>  At some later date the ship was confiscated by the Kings and all of its records (including the accurate charts of [[Númenor]]) perished in the Downfall.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, note 8</ref>

== Etymology ==
"Sea Home" in [[Quenya]] (from ''[[eär]]'' = "sea" and ''[[bar]]'' = "home").
