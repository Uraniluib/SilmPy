'''Barazinbar''' is the [[Khuzdul]] name for '''Redhorn'''<ref>{{HM|TI}}, p. 174</ref>, named [[Caradhras]] in [[Sindarin]]. During the reign of [[Durin VI]], the dwarves of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] mined beneath Baranzinbar seeking ''[[mithril]]''. In doing so, they woke [[Durin's Bane]].<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>

It was also called '''[[Baraz]]''' meaning "Red".<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
From the elements ''[[baraz]]'' "red" and ''[[-inbar]]'' (individually perhaps *''nibar''<ref>[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish] by [[Magnus Åberg]]</ref>) meaning "horn".
