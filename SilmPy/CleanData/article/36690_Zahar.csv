'''''zahar''''' appears to be a [[Khuzdul]] word, only attested in the compound name ''[[Tumunzahar]]''. The whole name is translated "Hollowbold",<ref>{{S|10}}</ref> and [[Magnus Åberg]] has suggested that the element ''zahar'' means "hollow".<ref>[[Magnus Åberg]], "[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.pdf An analysis of Dwarvish]" at [http://www.forodrim.org/index_en.html Forodrim.org] (accessed 5 November 2011)</ref>
