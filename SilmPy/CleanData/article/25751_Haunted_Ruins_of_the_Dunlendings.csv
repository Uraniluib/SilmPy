== Cover/Jacket Text == 

Three low-to-mid level adventures which each stand on their own and can be set up in minutes. 

Sixteen merchants have died on the treacherous road between the towns of Cabed Angren and Sarn Erech. Forlong, a wealthy landowner, believes that bandits are behind the killings and has offered a rich reward for their extermination. Are you cunning enough to unravel the mystery surrounding The Lonely Tower? 

Setmaenen, an abandoned calendar-temple of the ancient Daen Coentis, harbors a king's fortune in jewels and treasures. But the holy place is protected by powerful wards and traps, guarded by ghosts, and tainted by a cursed artifact of the Dark Lord. Can you defeat the supernatural forces that lurk among The Seven Stones? 

Only Tarien, Lady of a wealthy DÃºnadan family, escaped with her infant grandson when Dunnish warriors attacked her rural home. Her son, Derovin, was captured and taken to the haunted butte called Hogo Tarosvan. The Lady seeks revenge and the safe return of her son. Have you courage enough to search beyond The Phantom Doors? 

Peril lurks among the Dunnish ruins, but glory and wealth follow danger in these 3 exciting adventures!
