The '''Gwathló''', also known as '''Greyflood''' and previously known as '''Gwathir''', was the name of the river separating [[Minhiriath]] from [[Enedwaith]]. It began at the confluence of the rivers [[Mitheithel]] ([[Hoarwell]]) and [[Glanduin]], from whence it flowed south-west until it emptied into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] at [[Lond Daer]]. The only crossing point was at [[Tharbad]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
===The Second Age===
[[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]], the son of [[Tar-Meneldur]], was the first [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] to find the mouth of the Gwathló. After the king forbade the cutting of trees in [[Númenor]], Aldarion established a haven called [[Vinyalondë]] or "New Haven" at the mouth of the river the Númenóreans called the [[Gwathir]], or "River of Shadow". There Númenórean ships could be repaired and men could go forth and cut timber.<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

When explorers from Aldarion's ship ventured up the river in small boats they found huge trees overshadowing the waters. They thus named the river the ''Gwath-hîr'' ("Shadow-river") which became ''Gwathir''. However, later when the Númenóreans penetrated further up the river they found great fens, the ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' or "[[Swanfleet]]". Mistakenly believing that the fens were the source of the river they changed the name of the waterway to ''Gwathló'', where the ''lô'' meant fenland and thus the new name meant the "shadowy river from the fens". This [[Sindarin]] name was translated into [[Adûnaic]] as ''Agathurush''.

The lumbering activities of the Númenóreans began along the banks of the Gwathló so that the timber could be floated downstream to the haven. Wanting more wood for their ships the Númenóreans cut great roads into the forests north and south of the river, which aroused the enmity of the scattered forest dwellers. These people attacked the Númenóreans but they were driven away, either north-west into the [[Eryn Vorn]] or south-east into [[Dunland]]. Eventually the lands along the Gwathló became denuded of trees. As more Númenórean settlements were established in [[Middle-earth]] the name of ''Vinyalondë'' was changed to ''Lond Daer'', or in full ''Lond Daer Enedh'', the "Great Middle Haven".<ref name="LD">{{UT|6d}}</ref>

In {{SA|1695}} [[Sauron]]'s forces invaded [[Eriador]] and by {{SA|1699|n}} he had overrun the region.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> He pressed on with the intention of taking [[Lindon]] while leaving a powerful detachment to contain [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. Unbeknownst to the Dark Lord in {{SA|1695|n}} [[Gil-galad]] had sent messages to Númenor requesting aid. The great fleet of [[Tar-Minastir]] arrived in {{SA|1700|n}} and the Númenóreans and the Elves drove Sauron back from the river [[Lhûn]] and pushed him further back from the [[Baranduin]]. Worse for Sauron was to follow, for the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] had sent a host to Lond Daer and they attacked the rear of Sauron's army. In the [[Battle of the Gwathló]] Sauron was heavily defeated and escaped with but a small bodyguard.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

===The Third Age===
During the time of the Númenóreans the ford below the Swanfleet had merely marked the end of navigation. However, after the establishment of the Kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] a great [[Bridge of Tharbad|bridge]] was built at this point so that the North-South Road could connect the two realms. [[Tharbad]] arose as a garrison town of soldiers, mariners and engineers. The town lasted until the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}}, after which it fell into swift decay.<ref name="LD"/>

In {{TA|861}} when the kingdom of Arnor was divided,<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the portion that became [[Cardolan]] had the Gwathló as its southern boundary.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

The bridge at Tharbad long remained intact, but in {{TA|2911|n}} the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] froze the river and in {{TA|2912|n}} great floods ruined Tharbad and it became deserted.<ref name="TA"/> In {{TA|3018}} when [[Boromir]] came to Tharbad he found only a dangerous ford and in crossing lost his horse.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>
