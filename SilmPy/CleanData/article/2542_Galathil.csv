'''Galathil''' was a grandson of King [[Thingol]]'s brother [[Elmo]], and himself the brother of [[Celeborn]], the [[Lord of Lórien]]. His daughter [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]] wedded [[Dior]], Thingol's Heir, and so Galathil was a distant ancestor of both [[Elrond]] and [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Galathil and his close kin shared names with the [[White Tree (disambiguation)|White Trees]].<ref name=UT6e/><ref name=PMV/>{{rp|147-8}}

The conception of this name was based on Tolkien's idea that Celeborn's name was first devised to mean 'Silver Tree', and his close kin all had 'tree-names'.<ref name=UT6e>{{UT|6e}}</ref>  Although he later changed what he wanted Celeborn's name to mean, refering to 'silver' and 'tall' from the adjective ''ornā'' (uprising, tall) instead of 'silver' and tree' from the noun ''ornē'' (tree), he did not revise the name meanings of his close kin.<ref name=UT6e/> 

Based on Tolkien's original version of the family's names, Galathil is a name that can be seen in the tree name ''Galathilion'', which was another name for [[Telperion]]. This was also the name of the White Tree of [[Tirion]], '[[Galathilion]] the Less', and its seedlings were ''Celeborn'' in [[Eressëa]] and ''Nimloth'' in [[Númenor]].<ref name=PMV>{{PM|V}}</ref>{{rp|147-8}}  In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Galathilion was the tree of Tol Eressëa, and [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] was its seedling.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref><ref name=PMV/>{{rp|163-4}}
