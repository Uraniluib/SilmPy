'''Kibil-nâla''' was the [[Dwarvish]] name for the river that ran through [[Lothlórien]], known to the [[Elves]] as [[Celebrant]] and to [[Men]] as the [[Silverlode]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

==Etymology==

*''[[kibil]]'' ("silver") + ''[[nâla]]'' (?"channel; path; rivercourse")

The river's name seems to come originally from the workings of the Dwarves, as they seem to have discovered silver in the river.<ref>{{TI|VIII}}, p. 175</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest drafts of [[Appendix A]], the river's name was given as '''Zigil-nâd'''.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, pp. 279, 286</ref> Considering the meaning of ''[[zigil]]'', [[Edouard Kloczko]] has proposed that ''Kibil-nâla'' is not the name of the actual river, but only of "the reappearance of the river". He connects ''kibil'' to [[Adûnaic]] ''[[khibil]]'', "spring".<ref>[[Edouard Kloczko]], [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/268 Elfling message 268]</ref> This seems unlikely, as Tolkien explicitly stated: "''Silverlode'' dwarfish [sic] ''Kibilnâla''".<ref>{{TI|Lothlorien}}, p. 241 (note 36)</ref>
