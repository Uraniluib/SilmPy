'''''Darker than the Darkness''''' is a set of two additional adventures for the ''[[Lord of the Rings Adventure Game]]'': "Darker than the Darkness", written by Margaret and Dan Henley, and "Bad Men, Full O' Thievery", written by Matthias and Karen Birkner. 

== Back Cover Text == 

Now, like Bilbo (and Frodo), you too can have great adventures - pausing in Rivendell before daring the perils that lurk in Middle-earth's forgotten nooks and crannies.

'''Challenge Awaits You!'''

''"Darker Than The Darkness"'' is the first sequel to the ''Lord of the Rings Adventure Game''™. On the downs southeast of Bree, you must defeat a dread force or face a fate worse than death. Then challenge the Bandit-king who rules the Great East Road.

'''Its's Fun!'''

All ''Lord of the Rings Adventure Game'' sequels use the same fun and user-friendly storytelling format you mastered in your first adventure ''"Dawn Comes Early."'' You'll start playing as soon as you turn the title page! ''(Remember, you do need the boxed game to play!)''

'''The Excitement Goes On!'''

Look for the next sequel adventure when you're ready for more fun. ''"Over The Misty Mountains Cold"'' starts where ''"Darker than the Darkness"'' ends, revealing a new menace that threatens all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.

When you're ready for more epic adventuring in J.R.R. Tolkien's world, check your game- or bookstore for the best-selling ''Middle-earth Role Playing''™. It's the perfect next step up!
