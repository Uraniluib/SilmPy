==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
There were two versions of the genealogical table for the House of Hador.  In the first version of the table there was a note that Belemir and Adanel had ''five'' children and that Beren was their fifth.  In the second version there was no reference to these other children.  The section of the second version shown above shows only the first Beren although the other children may have existed.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (ii) The House of Hador'', p. 233</ref>  The two unnamed siblings of Emeldir were noted in the final version of the House of Bëor genealogy<ref name="WJwest"/> and so are included in the table.
