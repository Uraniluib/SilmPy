'''The Eagle and Child''', also known as "Bird and Brat" and "Bird and Baby",  was the public house where the [[Inklings]] would meet on Tuesday mornings.

[[Christopher Lee]] visited the pub during the 1950s, and one time he met [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in person.

In the back room, there is a small plaque on the wall commemorating The [[Inklings]] meetings.

In April [[2006]], British Consumer Campaign "The Campaign for Real Ale" (CaMRA) announced that they would be placing commemorative plaques outside British pubs of historical or cultural significance. In the initial list of 14 proposed plaques, "The Eagle and Child" was named.

The [[Inklings]] also met at the [[Lamb and Flag]] which is directly across the road.
