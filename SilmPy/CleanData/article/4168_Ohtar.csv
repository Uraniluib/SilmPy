'''Ohtar''' was the squire of [[Isildur]].

==History==
Ohtar was apparently a [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnadan of Arnor]] and by the first years of the [[Third Age]] he was fully trained and experienced and had attained the rank of "Soldier". He served as the squire of [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] [[Isildur]], and was dear to him.<ref name=UTnote/>

He accompanied Isildur's retinue from [[Gondor]] to [[Arnor]], when they were ambushed by the [[Gladden Fields]]. Ohtar was one of only three survivors of the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]. He rescued the shards of [[Elendil]]'s sword, [[Narsil]], and brought them safely back to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

==Etymology==
On the name ''Ohtar'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] writes: 
:''Ohtar is the name only used in legends; but it is probably only the title of address that Isildur used at this tragic moment, hiding his feelings under formality. ''Ohtar'' 'warrior, soldier' was the title of all who, though fully trained and experienced, had not yet been admitted to the rank of ''roquen'', 'knight'. But Ohtar was dear to Isildur and of his own kin.''<ref name=UTnote>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 17.</ref>
