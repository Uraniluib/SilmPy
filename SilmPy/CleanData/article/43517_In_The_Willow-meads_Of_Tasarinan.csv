'''In the Willow-meads of Tasarinan''' is a song that was sung by [[Treebeard]] on [[29 February]]{{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> as he strode through [[Fangorn Forest]], taking [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to his home of [[Wellinghall]] at the foot of the mountain [[Methedras]].  Treebeard had been telling the hobbits of the "broad days" in the [[First Age]] when the forests were much more extensive and after a bit of silence began chanting this song as he walked.

<poem style="font-style:italic;margin-left:20px;">
In the willow-meads of [[Nan-tathren|Tasarinan]] I walked in the Spring.
Ah! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!
And I said that was good.
I wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of [[Ossiriand]].
Ah! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir!
And I thought that was best.
To the beeches of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]] I came in the Autumn.
Ah! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in Taur-na-neldor!
It was more than my desire.
To the pine-trees upon the highland of [[Dorthonion]] I climbed in the Winter.
Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon [[Orod-na-Thôn]]!
My voice went up and sang in the sky.
And now all those lands lie under the wave,
And I walk in [[Ambaróna|Ambarona]], in [[Tauremorna]], in [[Aldalómë]],
In my own land, in the country of Fangorn,
Where the roots are long,
And the years lie thicker than the leaves
In Tauremornalómë.
