'''Forlindon''' was a name for the northern part of [[Lindon]], north of the [[Gulf of Lune]] and west of the [[Blue Mountains]]. The land was traversed by a river which ended on the northern shore of the Gulf; the haven of [[Forlond]] was built there, on its mouths.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Off its north-western coasts stood the island of [[Himring]], where [[Maedhros]]'s fortress had once stood.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
Prior to the [[Great Battle]] the land of Lindon had been part of [[Ossiriand]]; afterwards the remnant was called Lindon, split into Forlindon and [[Harlindon]] by the newly created Gulf of Lune.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

[[Gil-Galad]] lived in Forlindon in the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Forlindon'' likely means "North Lindon",<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 30 (note 47)</ref> apparently derived from ''forn'' ([[Sindarin]]; "right, north") + ''[[Lindon#Etymology|lindon]]''.<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 22 October 2011)</ref>
