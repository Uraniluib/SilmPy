{{Adaptation}}
The '''Lay of Leithian ''adapted''''' is a fan-originated attempt to reconcile the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' with the later mythology as given in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

The intent of the project is to provide a modern edition of an unbroken account of the tale, told from beginning to end, utilizing [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s latest writing and thought on the subject as much as possible. Some minor revisions, emendation and additions to Tolkien's original work are present but noted. The site is fully annotated and contains all of Tolkien's latest text and revisions integrated into the body of the poem.  The final section of the tale, as told in ''The Silmarillion'', is appended to the end to fill in the remainder of the story where the fragment leaves off.
