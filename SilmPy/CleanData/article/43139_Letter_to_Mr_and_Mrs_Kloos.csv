==Excerpts==

{{Quote|[The [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]] has part of his origin in the fact that both my grandfathers were longeval. My [[John Benjamin Tolkien|father's father]] was in his eleventh year when [[Wikipedia:Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] was fought; my [[Tolkien Family|mother's father]], a much younger man, was born before [[Wikipedia:Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria]] came to the throne, and survived till his ninety-ninth year, missing his 'hundred' (with which he was as much concerned as [[Bilbo]] was to surpass the Old Took) only because he mowed a large lawn that spring and then sat in the wind without a jacket.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name=RC/>}}

{{Quote|[The incidents of the [[Witch-king]]'s [[Morgul-knife|knife]] in [[Flight to the Ford|Book I, Chapter 12]], and of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s [[Daggers of Westernesse|sword]] in [[The Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Book V, Chapter 6]]] were intended to be integrated with the entire mytho-historical background, events in an agelong war. [[Frodo]] received his wound from the Witchking under [[Weathertop]], the bulwark of the ancient fortified line made by the [[Númenóreans|Numenoreans]] against his kingdom; Meriadoc's dagger was taken from the gravemounds of the same people. It was made by smiths who knew all about [[Sauron]] and his servants, and made in prophetic vision or hope of ending just as it did. [spellings ''sic'']|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name=RC/>}}
