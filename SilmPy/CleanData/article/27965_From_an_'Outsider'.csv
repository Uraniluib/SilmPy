'''From an "Outsider"''' is the title of a memoir written by [[James Dundas-Grant]] and originally published in ''[[Remembering C.S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis at the Beakfast Table and Other Reminiscences]]'' (1979). Although foremostly a recollection of his teacher [[C.S. Lewis]], Dundas-Grant also recalls memories of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. They first met at Lewis's rooms in Oxford in [[1944]]:

{{quote|It was thus I came to meet [C.S. Lewis's] great friend Tolkien: tall, swept-back grey hair, restless. He read to us parts of his manuscript for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', asking for criticism.|"From an 'Outsider'"}}

After [[World War II]], Dundas-Grant joined the [[Inklings]] at the [[Eagle and Child]]:

{{quote|We met every Tuesday morning over a glass of beer. [[Warren Lewis|Warnie]], [C.S. Lewis's] brother, was there; MacCallum of Pembroke; Father [[Gervase Mathew]], O.P., from Blackfriars; Tolkien of Merton and Havard. Others came and went. We sat in a small back room with a fine coal fire in winter. Back and forth the conversation would flow. Latin tags flying around. Homer quoted in the original to make a point. And Tolkien, jumping up and down, declaiming in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]].|"From an 'Outsider'"}}

After the death of Lewis, Dundas-Grant finally recalls that he attended a Mass in memory of Lewis, together with Tolkien and [[Robert Havard]].
