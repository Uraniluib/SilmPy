In his notes on 'Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth,' he claimed that his notions, based on 'beauty, majesty and simplicity' sprang from his understanding of Mary. Writing in an unpublished letter to Clyde Kilby, Tolkien refers to those who fail to accept fully 'all' the consequences of the Incarnation story as told in Scripture. 'There is something missing from any kind of Christian thought that could make such an omission.'<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.speroforum.com/forum/topic.asp?whichpage=1&TOPIC_ID=6436&#122664|articlename=Mary and Lord of the Rings|dated=|website=[http://www.speroforum.com/forum/default.asp Spero Forum]|accessed=31 December 2011}}</ref>
