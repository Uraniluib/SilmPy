'''Dor Firn-i-Guinar''', the '''Land of the Dead that Live''', was the name given by the [[Eldar]] to the region surrounding the isle of [[Tol Galen]] in southern [[Ossiriand]], where [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] lived after their return from the dead.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> It is told that the country was exceptionally beautiful, even reminding of the blessed land of [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>

==Etymology==

''Dor Firn-i-Guinar'' is the name appearing in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'',<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> apparently consisting of the [[Sindarin]] elements ''[[dor]]'' "land" + ''[[firn]]'' "dead" + ''[[in]]'' "who, that" + ''[[cuinar]]'' "live".<ref name=Tolkiendil>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 10 November 2011)</ref>

In his manuscripts, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] experimented with many variations on how to translate ''Land of the Dead that Live'': ''I·Cuilwarthon'', ''I·Guilwarthon'', ''Cuilwarthien'', ''Gwerth-i-cuina'', and ''Gwerth-i-guinar''.<ref>{{HM|IX}} (entries for ''Land of the Dead that Live'')</ref> In a [[1972]] letter, Tolkien used the name ''Dor Gyrth i chuinar''.<ref>{{L|332}}, p. 417</ref>
