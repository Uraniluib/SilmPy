'''Malbeth''' was a [[seer]] and royal counsellor gifted with [[foresight]] who is remembered in lore for two prophecies concerning the fate of the descendants of [[Isildur]]. 

==History==
Malbeth was probably a [[Dúnedain of the North|Dúnadan of Arthedain]] who appears to have been a royal counsellor.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Malbeth"</ref><ref group=note>Malbeth's Númenorean ancestry is also evidenced in the length of time between the dates of the seer's known prophecies (1864 and 1975); at the time of the second prophecy, Malbeth must had been well over 100 years old.</ref> 
===Last King of Arthedain===
In {{TA|1864}} when the son of [[Araphant]] (fourteenth [[Kings of Arnor|King]] of [[Arthedain]]) was born, Malbeth advised Araphant to name his son [[Arvedui]] meaning "''last king''",{{quote|Arvedui you shall call him, for he will be the last in Arthedain. Though a choice will come to the Dúnedain, and if they take the one that seems less hopeful, then your son will change his name and become king of a great realm. If not, then much sorrow and many lives of men shall pass, until the Dúnedain arise and are united again.|[[Appendix A]]}}
In {{TA|1975}} Arvedui was forced north by the forces of [[Angmar]] to the Ice Bay of [[Forochel]] to seek the help of the [[Lossoth]]. [[Círdan]], hearing of Arvedui's plight from Arvedui's son [[Aranarth]] sent a ship to rescue him in the spring of that year. The Snowmen advised the king not to board the ship as they could smell danger in the air, they suggested that the king should wait until the summer when the [[Witch-king]]'s power isn't so strong. Arvedui did not heed the advise and he perished when the ship broke upon some ice in a severe storm; thus, Malbeth's prophecy was fulfilled.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

===Paths of the Dead===
Malbeth's second prophecy was in the days of the Arvedui (ruled {{TA|1964}} - {{TA|1974|n}}), the last king of Arthedain, in which the seer foretold [[Aragorn]]'s passage through the [[Paths of the Dead]] even though the event was over a thousand years in the future:{{quote|Over the land there lies a long shadow,<br>westward reaching wings of darkness.<br>The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings<br>doom approaches. The Dead awaken;<br>for the hour is come for the oathbreakers:<br>at the [[Stone of Erech]] they shall stand again<br>and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.<br>Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them<br>from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?<br>The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.<br>From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:<br>he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.|[[The Return of the King]], "[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]"}}<ref name=company>{{RK|Company}}</ref>
==Legacy==
Malbeth's second prophecy was also fulfilled in {{TA|3019}} during the [[War of the Ring]] when Aragorn (sixteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]) learned from the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' that [[Gondor]] was being threatened from the south by a fleet of [[Corsairs]] from [[Umbar]]. He needed a route to get to them in haste, and Elrond's message ("''Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the Paths of the Dead''") told him how.

Aragorn (with [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]] and the [[Grey Company]]) travelled through the Paths of the Dead to the Stone of Erech where Aragorn blew a horm to summon the [[Oathbreakers]]. He told them he was [[Isildur]]'s heir and so they fulfilled their oath and defeated the Corsairs which helped Gondor win the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=company />

==Etymology==
Malbeth's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Golden Word" from ''[[mal]]'' meaning "gold", and ''[[peth]]'' (becoming lenited to ''beth'') meaning "word, voice".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.realelvish.net/book_names.php|articlename=What do all those Names in the Books Mean?|website=[http://www.realelvish.net/ Merin Essi ar Quenteli!]}}</ref>
