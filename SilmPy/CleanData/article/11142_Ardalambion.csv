'''Ardalambion''', or '''[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/ www.uib.no/People/hnohf]''', is a linguistic website launched in [[1997]], concentrating on the languages of Tolkien in general. The website is maintained by [[Helge Fauskanger]].

It has articles on both the better-known languages, such as [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], and the lesser-known, such as [[Telerin]] and [[Valarin]].  It also includes language courses and wordlists, word-by-word analyses of the corpus and other miscellaneous articles.

The name translates as "Of the languages of Arda".
