The '''Sceptre of Annúminas''' was a silver rod, originally the symbol of office of the [[:Category:Lords of Andúnië|Lords of Andúnië]] in [[Númenor]]. It survived the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]], and was held by the [[Kings of Arnor]] while that realm lasted.

After that the sceptre was kept in [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}} "The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain"</ref>
