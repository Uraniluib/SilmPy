'''Valaquenta''' ([[Quenya|Q]]. "Account of the Valar (=Powers)") is a text that accompanies [[Quenta Silmarillion]].

The text presents knowledge on the Ainur as derived from the [[Eldar]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> It is not written however by their own first-hand point of view. There are also some references that are out of context, like the [[Númenóreans]], which indicate that the text was written during or after the [[Second Age]].

== Summary ==
''Valar'' is the name given to the chief [[Ainur]] following their descent to [[Arda]]. The Ainur were angelic spirits created by the supreme deity, [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]]. The most powerful of the Valar was [[Morgoth|Melkor]], who became corrupt, and ceased to follow the will of Ilúvatar. The fourteen remaining Valar continued in Ilúvatar's will.<ref>{{S|IIa}}</ref>

===The Valar===
The Ainur had either male or female forms, some were couples, while some were siblings in Ilúvatar's mind. Thus, there were seven male Valar, and seven female ("[[Valier]]"). Of the fourteen, those eight with the greatest might (called [[Aratar]]) were responsible for some attribute of life in [[Arda]] (e.g., crafts, mining, agriculture, etc.). The king of the Valar, and of all Arda was [[Manwë]].<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

===The Maiar===
On their descent to Arda, the Valar, were followed by Ainur of lesser might, the [[Maiar]], who were their subjects, students and assistants in governing Arda. The Valar had the ability to change their physical appearance, or to bear no shape at all.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

===The Enemies===
Of the enemies are mentioned Melkor, [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrogs]], spirits who were seduced by him and fell into hate.<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

== History of Composition ==
Although sequential descriptions of the Valar go back to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the earliest writing that resembles the Valaquenta is found in the text called ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]''.<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}</ref>  It then became Chapter 1 of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' (entitled ''Of the Valar'').  In revisions to the Quenta Silmarillion done in 1958, the section was split off into a separately titled work.<ref>{{MR|P3II1}}</ref>  There is nothing to indicate why Tolkien felt that the piece should stand alone.  While it is not a narrative, neither is the chapter ''[[Of Beleriand and its Realms]]'', and Tolkien never seems to have considered removing that section.

Within the [[Legendarium]], the ''Valaquenta'' was preserved through ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]'' by [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>
