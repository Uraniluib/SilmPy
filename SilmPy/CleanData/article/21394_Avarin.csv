'''Avarin''' is a term used to refer to the combined languages of the [[Avari]].

==Structure==

There were at least six different languages, or dialects, in the Avarin group.<ref name=Author>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 9, p. 410</ref> The various dialects did not have a common development,<ref name=PE19>{{PE|19}}, pp. 18-28</ref> although all descended from [[Primitive Quendian]].<ref name=Author/>

Three larger divisions of Avarin are recorded: West Avarin, North Avarin and East Avarin. The West Avarin group was nearest to the [[Eldarin]] languages of the west; North Avarin was very peculiar, with no initial consonant groups. Not much is known of East Avarin.<ref name=PE19/>

==Other versions==
The Avarin were called [[Lemberin]] tongues which originally intended to have a resemblance in sound to Goidelic, Baltic, and Finnic languages.<ref>[[David Salo]]'s [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36029 post] in [[Elfling]]</ref>
