'''"Precious"''', alternatively '''"the Precious"''', '''"my Precious"''' or '''"his Precious"''', was a name given to [[the One Ring]] by various [[Ring-bearers]].  Its use indicated the morbid covetousness induced in holders of the Ring by the Ring itself. 
 
==History==
The very first Ring-bearer (besides [[Sauron]]) was the first to apply the term "precious" to the One Ring.  In {{TA|2}},<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Isildur]], who had taken the Ring from Sauron, wrote a [[Scroll of Isildur|scroll]] in which he described what he claimed as an heirloom for the [[Arnor|North Kingdom]].  At the end ofthe document he wrote:
 
:''But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair.  It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.''<ref name="Council">{{FR|II2}}</ref>
 
Centuries later, in {{TA|2463|n}}, [[Gollum]] took possession of the Ring after murdering [[DÃ©agol]].  In {{TA|2470|n}}, Gollum hid in the [[Misty Mountains]], taking the Ring with him into darkness.<ref name="TA"/> When he began calling the Ring his "precious" is unknown, but by {{TA|2941|n}} when he met [[Bilbo Baggins]] he was referring to "my precious" constantly.<ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref> It is difficult to distinguish whether Gollum was referring to the Ring or to himself when he used this term, which seems to indicate how much the Ring dominated his mind.
 
On [[22 September]] {{TA|3001|n}} Bilbo held his [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]].<ref name="TA"/>  After vanishing after his speech he returned to [[Bag End]] to make his final preparations to depart from [[the Shire]].  When [[Gandalf]] urged the old hobbit to leave the Ring for [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo became angry.  He announced:
 
:''It is mine, I tell you. My own.  My precious.  Yes, my precious.''<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>
 
Eventually Gandalf was able to persuade Bilbo to relinquish the Ring, but Bilbo's behavior and his use of the word "precious" alarmed the wizard and spurred him to investigate the history of Bilbo's magic ring, leading him to Isildur's scroll.<ref name="Council"/>
 
In the [[Cracks of Doom]] on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> Frodo claimed the Ring for himself and was immediately set upon by Gollum. Gollum won the fight and danced about with the Ring, shouting, "Precious, precious, precious! "  He then slipped and fell into the chasm and the last word he wailed was "precious".<ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref>
