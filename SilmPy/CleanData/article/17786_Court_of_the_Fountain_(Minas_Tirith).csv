The '''Court of the Fountain''' was part of the highest level in the citadel of [[Minas Tirith]], near the steps to the [[Tower of Ecthelion]].  This courtyard held the [[White Tree of Gondor]] and was guarded by the [[Guards of the Citadel]].  It was paved with white stones except around a fountain, where a sward of green lay.  The [[Dead Tree|dead White Tree]], seen by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] as he hurried after [[Gandalf]], drooped over the fountain.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>
