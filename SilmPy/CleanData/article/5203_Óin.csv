'''Óin''' ({{TA|2774}} - {{TA|2994|n}},<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> 220 years old) was one of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who set out to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] from [[Smaug]].   Later, he followed [[Balin]] in an ill-fated attempt to retake [[Moria]].

==History==
Óin was the son of [[Gróin]] and older brother of [[Glóin]], both of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name="Durin"/>

===The Quest of Erebor===
Óin was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]].  He wore a brown hood.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

Óin and Glóin were noted for their ability to start fires, although both failed on the night that the company met the [[trolls]].  In their frustration they began to quarrel and eventually to fight, which was the incident that prompted the company to head for the fire seen far off on a hill.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

In the glade where the wolves came to gather, Óin was one of five Dwarves who climbed up to fairly comfortable seats in a huge pine tree.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Óin and Glóin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Óin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria===
In {{TA|2989}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Óin had followed Balin with a [[Balin's Colony|colony]] of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient mansions of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which were occupied by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>  At first the colony did well, but on [[November 10]], {{TA|2994|n}} Balin was killed, and the Orcs returned. They took the [[Great Gates|East-gate]]/[[First Hall]] then the [[Second Hall]] after a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle]] which Óin likely fought in.  
Óin went with a party to find escape via the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] but they found the water up to the doors and he was killed by the [[Watcher in the Water]]. Of his party only four returned five days after they had left, and soon thereafter all the remaining colonists were killed in a [[Last Stand of Balin's Colony|final stand]] in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>

When [[Frodo Baggins]] came to [[Rivendell]] he met [[Glóin]], who delighted in telling the hobbit about the doings of the renewed dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain.  But when Frodo asked about [[Óin]], Balin, and Ori, Glóin's face darkened and he said that he did not know.  Their fate was largely why the Dwarves had come to Rivendell at that time, to seek news from [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

:{{Blockquote|Along with his brother Gloin, Oin is a distant cousin of Thorin Oakenshield. A brave Northern Dwarf, Oin joins The Company of Thorin Oakenshield out of a sense of loyalty to his kin, and also because he has a substantial sum of money invested in the venture. Well read with an enquiring mind, Oin is the healer among the Company, often applying an herbal salve of his own invention – which has since come to be known as ‘ointment’ after its maker.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="HobbitApp">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}
:Perhaps the oldest of the 13 Dwarves (next to Balin), Óin is also hard of hearing, as he carries an ear trumpet (which got trodden on by a [[Orcs|Goblin]] in [[Goblin-town]] when the company was captured, though he mostly manages to bend it back into its original shape after their escape).  Because of the fact that he was the group's de facto medicine man (and also presumably due to his older age), he opts to stay behind in [[Lake-town]] (along with [[Fíli]]) to look after [[Kíli]] when [[Thorin]] deems him too ill (from having been struck by a poisoned arrow) to accompany the group on the final leg of their quest up to the Lonely Mountain.  He is in awe of [[Tauriel]]'s Elvish healing powers when she ultimately heals Kíli's wound.
