==Summary==
Tolkien said he appreciated shrewd sound-hearted maiden aunts, a blessing to those that have them.  He had a professional aunt, one of the first to take a science degree, who had gone botanizing in Switzerland in her late eighties.  She had been part of the party that included Tolkien that long ago had hiked through the mountains and high passes of that country.  Near the [[Wikipedia:Aletsch Glacier|Aletsch]] they had nearly been crushed by an avalanche of boulders loosened by the sun (one passed between Tolkien and the hiker in front).  That and the "thunder battle" (a bad night spent in a cattle-shed) had appeared in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

Tolkien told Reeves that he enjoyed her story.<ref group="note">Joyce Reeves had published ''Woorroo'' and send Tolkien a copy.</ref>
