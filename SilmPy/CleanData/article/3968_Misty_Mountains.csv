The '''Misty Mountains''', '''Mountains of Mist''' or '''Towers of Mist'''<ref name=s3/> ('''''Hithaeglir''''' in [[Sindarin]]<ref group="note">The Hithaeglir were misspelled as "Hithaiglin" on the original ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' map. </ref> as a plural) was a great mountain range that lay between [[Eriador]] in the west and the Great River [[Anduin]] in the east. 

== Geographic Features ==
In the far north, the Misty Mountains formed a '''T''' with the [[Grey Mountains]] and the [[Mountains of Angmar]].<ref name=map/> They ran 795 miles (1,280 kilometres){{fact}} to the [[Gap of Rohan]] in the south, where they approached vertically the [[White Mountains]]. The Gap was a passable valley between the southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the White.<ref group="note">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimates in the ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' that some of the peaks may have been as high as 12,000 feet (3,660 meters), comparable to the Alps in Europe. Tolkien had visited the Alps in his youth and was greatly impressed by them.</ref>

The lands around the Misty Mountains included several forests, rivers and other populated areas. Such realms under the Mountains had been [[Angmar]], [[Eregion]], [[Dunland]], [[Lothlórien]], [[Fangorn]] and others.<ref name=map/> While Elves guarded both sides of the Misty Mountains, few ever crossed them.

=== Important Peaks ===
The northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains can be considered Mount [[Gundabad]],<ref name=map/> where according to legend, [[Durin]], eldest of the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], awoke. Later it became a [[Orc-holds|haven for Orcs]].

The greatest [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] realm in Middle-Earth, [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The city was built under three peaks, the [[Mountains of Moria]]: Redhorn (''[[Caradhras]]'' in Sindarin), Silvertine (''[[Celebdil]]'') and Cloudyhead (''[[Fanuidhol]]'').<ref name=south>{{FR|South}}</ref> Inside Silvertine the Dwarves built the [[Endless Stair]], a stairway from the foundations of the mountain to its peak. 

The southernmost mountain was [[Methedras]] (Sindarin for "Last Peak").<ref name=map>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

=== Passes===
[[Image:Alan Lee - The Pass of Caradhras.jpg|thumb|250px|"The Pass of Caradhras" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
The most important passes were the [[High Pass]] and the [[Redhorn Pass]]. There was also a pass at the source of the [[Gladden River]].<ref name=south/>

== History ==
The Misty Mountains were created by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] during the [[Years of the Trees]] as a hindrance for [[Oromë]], who would hunt his fell creatures. They would later serve as a deterrent for the Elves during the [[Great Journey]], causing some to turn south. The Elves that would not cross the Misty Mountains would become the [[Nandor]].<ref name=s3>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

It is said that ancient [[bears]] lived in the Mountains until [[Giants]] arrived and the bears left to the lowlands.<ref name=queer>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

The great Dwarven city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] (later called the "Black Pit" of [[Moria]]) was located near the middle of the mountain chain.  There [[Durin's folk]] lived for thousands of years with a kingdom which spread as far as Gundabad and as far east as the [[Iron Hills]]. 

At the southern tip of the Misty Mountains, beneath Methedras, was [[Isengard]], which was originally a [[Gondor|Gondorian]] fortress but was later given to [[Saruman]].

Around {{TA|1050|n}}, the [[Harfoots]] migrated west across the Misty Mountains, fleeing the ever more numerous Men and the Shadow growing in [[Mirkwood]], thus the [[Hobbits]] entered history. Later the other two groups of Hobbits, the [[Stoors]] and [[Fallohides]], migrated west as well, until by 2500 no Hobbits could be found east of the mountains. 

When the Dwarves were strong, the mountains were generally free of Orcs, but when the [[Shadow]] was strong, Orcs bred in Mount Gundabad, in [[Goblin-town]], later in Moria itself, and everywhere in between. In {{TA|1300}} the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] started increasing and harassing the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=b2>{{App|B2}}</ref>

The awakening of [[Durin's Bane]] drove the Dwarves from their city.  It also seems that some Dwarves, either before or after the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], dwelt on the eastern side of the mountains near Goblin-town. 

In {{TA|2480}} the Orcs began establishing secret strongholds in the Mountains barring all the passes to [[Eriador]] from [[Rhovanion]], while Sauron populated Moria with his creatures.<ref name=b2/>

Near the east exit of Goblin-town the Eagles kept an [[Eagle's Eyrie|eyrie]] to keep watch on the Orcs.<ref name=council>{{FR|Council}}</ref><ref>{{FR|South}}</ref> 

[[Gandalf]] believed that it was the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] that had driven the people of [[Beorn]] away, and he promised to return there.<ref name=queer/>

[[Thorin and Company]] used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains, and witnessed the mysterious [[Giants]]. Later they were captured by the Orcs of Goblin-town.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>

It seems that Beorn's people returned to the Mountains. Once the Orcs were decimated, the [[Beornings]] kept open the passages of the [[Ford of Carrock]] and the [[High Pass]] in return for tolls.<ref name=council/>

The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] faced the challenge to pass the Mountains. They decided to avoid the High Pass or the Gap of Rohan because of the threat of Orc patrols and Saruman's forces. They attempted to cross Redhorn Pass, but a powerful blizzard blocked it, forcing them to journey through Moria. There [[Gandalf]] was lost trying to stop Durin's Bane, and after falling into the abyss, he chased him up to the Dwarven [[Endless Stair]] and [[Battle of the Peak|fought on the peak]] of Silvertine.<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>

It is said that in the [[Fourth Age]] [[Durin VII]] led the Dwarves back to Moria.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

:Misty Mountains appear as both a major game region and within other game areas. The region of "Misty Mountains" consists of the part of the mountain range adjacent to Rivendell Valley, including both [[High Pass]] and [[Goblin-town]]. The mountain range in a broader sense can also be accessed from other in-game regions, including the pass Caradhras in [[Eregion]], former settlement of Dwarves under [[Thrór]] in eastern [[Enedwaith]], a village on the slopes of mount [[Methedras]] in [[Dunland]], the cliffs of [[Zirakzigil]] in Moria and the eastern slopes of the Mountains in [[Lothlórien]].
