== Excerpts ==

“Being influenced by, or making use of, events or experience of one’s life (which is inevitable) has nothing to do with allegory.”

“You will not find it possible, I think, to acquire a copy of the first edition... they are very scarce, most of the stocks having perished in the London blitz.”
