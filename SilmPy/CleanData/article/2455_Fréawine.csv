'''Fréawine''' ([[Third Age]] 2594 – 2680, aged 86 years) was fifth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Fréawine was the son of [[Fréa]] and grandson of [[Aldor]] the Old. On account of his grandfather's immensely long reign, Fréawine, like his father before him, became [[Rohan]]'s King in his old age, when he was already more than sixty years old. Little is said of his twenty-one years as King, except that it was a time of peace and plenty in the Mark. Fréawine was succeeded by his son [[Goldwine]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

It's possible that Fréawine had other descendants who eventually were mingled with the [[Dunlendings]] who returned after the time of Goldwine. Lord [[Freca]] claimed to be one of his descendants.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Fréawine is an [[Old English]] name that means "lord-friend".
