'''Ezellohar''', also called '''Corollairë''', was the '''Green Mound''' before the western gates of [[Valmar]], the city of the [[Valar]]. After being hallowed by [[Yavanna]] and watered by the tears of [[Nienna]], it was the place where the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]] grew.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>  Later [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]] came to Ezellohar and attacked the Two Trees and Ezellohar was blackened.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Ezellohar'' (pron. {{IPA|[eˈzelːoxar]}}) is [[Vanyarin]] for "Green Mound", containing the element ''ezel'', ''ezella'', ''ezello'' ("green").<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref><ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 9, pp. 356-7</ref> ''Ezellohar'' was derived from the [[Valarin]] name '''''Ezellôchâr'''''.

''Corollairë'' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌkorolˈlaɪre]}}) is a [[Quenya]] name, which appears to be a compressed version of ''Coron Oiolairë'' or "Mound of Ever-summer" (from ''[[coron]]'', "mound"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''coron''</ref> and ''[[oio]]'', "ever"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, '''OY'''</ref> plus ''[[lairë]]'', "summer"<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>).
