'''Utumno''' (in [[Quenya]]) or '''Udûn''' (in [[Sindarin]]) was a fortress of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] in the far north of [[Middle-earth]]. It was the first and greatest of Melkor's citadels, delved in the earliest days. It was the home to hosts of demons, the fallen [[Ainur]] who allied with Melkor, and numerous monsters of corruption were made in mockery of Middle-earth's naturally intended creatures and beings.<ref name="Captivity">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

==History==
Utumno was built by Melkor after his first expulsion from [[Arda]]. The [[Valar]] had by this time created the [[Two Lamps]]. Utumno was built under the [[Iron Mountains]], where the light of [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]] was dim and cold. Though the Valar did not yet know it, from this place, "the blight of his [Melkor's] hatred flowed out thence, and the Spring of Arda was marred."<ref name="Beginning">{{S|Beginning}}</ref>

Melkor used Utumno as his base of operations from the Valian Year 3400 until {{YT|1090}}, when the Valar assailed Melkor's fortress, which fell in {{YT|1099}}.<ref name="P2a">{{MR|P2a}}</ref>{{rp|53}}<ref name="P2e">{{MR|P2e}}</ref>{{rp|74-5}} From there he had destroyed the [[Two Lamps]], so that the [[Valar|Powers]] left [[Almaren]], their dwelling-place in [[Middle-earth]], and removed into the West. He then began his corruption of Arda.<ref name="Beginning"/> Utumno was also where the first captured [[Elves]] were taken and the creation of [[Orcs]] began as a mockery of the [[Firstborn]].

Utumno was laid waste in {{YT|1099}}, in [[Siege of Utumno|the war]] that the Valar began against Melkor for the [[War for the Sake of the Elves|sake of the Elves]]. The [[Valar]] attacked Udûn in full force, and destroyed it utterly, carrying its master back to Valinor as their prisoner. Melkor was chained and dragged as a captive to [[Valinor]].<ref name="Captivity"/>

Melkor had established a second and lesser fortress at the western end of the [[Iron Mountains|Ered Engrin]] to act as the first line of defence for Utumno from Aman.<ref name="Captivity"/> This became [[Angband]], which was at first held by [[Sauron]]. After the destruction of Utumno, Melkor chose to rebuild and fortify Angband as his lair.

==Etymology==
The name ''Utumno'' (pron. {{IPA|[uˈtumno]}}), contains the stem ''Utumnu-''. An older version of the name, ''Utumna'', is said to derive from ''Tumna'' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "low-lying, low, profound, deep").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>{{rp|269, 271}}

The name ''Udûn'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "dark pit, Underworld"<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 297</ref> or "hell"<ref>{{HM|LRI}}</ref>.

In the ''Annals of Aman'', Tolkien wrote: "'Utupnŭ √TUP cover over; hide'" and "'that stronghold was ever after called Utumno the Deep-hidden.'" In Etymologies (V.394) with the stem TUB, the original form of the name is given as ''Utubnu''.<ref name="P2a"/>

'''Udûn''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈuduːːn]}}) was the less commonly used [[Sindarin]] name of [[Utumno]]. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', this name appears just once, in [[Gandalf]]'s words to [[Durin's Bane]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

It survived, though, as a name for [[Udûn (valley)|the northern valley]] of [[Mordor]] that lay behind the [[Morannon]]. Undoubtedly, [[Sauron]] chose this name in memory of his ancient master's greatest stronghold.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was not entirely consistent with the location of Utumno, but it was always located within the northern Middle-earth, in or behind the Iron Mountains.

As noted from one of Tolkien's earlier sketch maps about Utumno from the [[Ambarkanta]], Utumno was previously spelled as "Utumna" and was north of the Iron Mountains, towards the western end of the mountain chain.<ref>{{SM|4}}</ref>
