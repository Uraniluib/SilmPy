==Summary==
Pauline Baynes had been contracted to illustrate ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''.  Tolkien had not seen her pictures until the day before.  He wrote to say that he was pleased beyond even the expectations aroused by the first examples.  They were more than illustrations, he extolled, they were a collateral theme.  Friends politely commented that they reduced his text to commentary on the drawings.
