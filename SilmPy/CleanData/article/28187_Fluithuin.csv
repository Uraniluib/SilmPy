In the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]], [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] is described as the son of [[Morgoth]] and the '[[ogres|ogress]]' '''Fluithuin''' or '''Ulbandi'''.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, ''Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin, Gothmog''</ref> Both 'ogresses' and the idea that the [[Valar]] had children were discarded by Tolkien fairly early on.
