The '''Angle''' in [[Eriador]] was the wedge of land between the rivers of [[Hoarwell]] and [[Bruinen|Loudwater]], south of the [[Trollshaws]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The Angle was originally part of the realm of [[Arnor]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>  In {{TA|861}}, in the division of Arnor,<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> the Angle became part of the kingdom of [[Rhudaur]].<ref name="Eriador"/>

The [[Stoors]], a branch of the race of [[Hobbits]], crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] westward into [[Eriador]] during the middle years of the [[Third Age]]. They were said to have emerged from the [[Redhorn Pass]] in about {{TA|1150|n}}, and from there they spread out across the wide lands, settling along their favoured riverways as far south as [[Tharbad]] and the [[Dunland]] borders. Their most noted settlement, though, was on the more northerly tongue of land - the Angle.<ref name="TA"/>

The [[Stoors]] only remained in the Angle for some two hundred years before they moved on again, but at this point their kind divided. Some travelled west and north, and their descendants eventually merged with the other [[Hobbits]] of [[Bree]] and [[the Shire]]. Others returned across the [[Misty Mountains]] and travelled back down into the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name="TA"/>

By the later centuries, when [[Aragorn]] and the [[Hobbits]] passed by the Trollshaws, the area probably had been deserted.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref><ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Angle"</ref>
