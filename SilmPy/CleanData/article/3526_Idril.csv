'''Idril Celebrindal''' was the daughter of King [[Turgon]] of [[Gondolin]]<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref> and [[Elenwë]], the wife of [[Tuor]], and the mother of [[Eärendil|Eärendil the Mariner]].

Of the [[Noldor]] who [[Flight of the Noldor|returned]] to [[Middle-earth]] documented to have [[Vanyar|Vanyarin]] ancestry, Idril has the most, being five-eighths Vanyarin by ancestry.  Her full-Vanyarin mother [[Elenwë]] fell during the crossing at [[Helcaraxë]], and so did not step foot in Middle-earth.  Idril's son [[Eärendil]] is also documented the most heavily Vanyarin of the [[Half-elven]], being five-sixteenths Vanyarin by ancestry.

== History ==

Idril Celebrindal was the only child of Turgon.  She participated in the [[Flight of the Noldor]], and in the crossing of the [[Helcaraxë]] her mother Elenwë, died. Together with [[Angrod]]'s son [[Orodreth]] she was one of the two Noldor in the third generation to come into exile. Idril was loved in secret by her cousin [[Maeglin]], the son of [[Eöl]] the Dark Elf and [[Aredhel]], Turgon's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, and the fact they were too closely related.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

When Tuor, son of [[Huor]] arrived in [[Gondolin]], Idril fell in love with him.  Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), and remembering the last words of Huor, he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second union of the [[Eldar]] and [[Edain]], after [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]].  Idril encouraged Tuor to build the secret passage known as [[Idril's secret way]], and thus enabled many to escape the [[Fall of Gondolin]].  In Gondolin she had a son, [[Eärendil]].

After the fall of Gondolin, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the [[Havens of Sirion]], where they also received [[Elwing]] daughter of [[Dior]] son of Beren and Lúthien.

When Tuor grew old he departed in his ship named Eärrámë for the [[Aman|West]], and Idril went with him. It is believed by the Elves and [[Dúnedain]] that Idril and Tuor arrived in Valinor, bypassing the [[Ban of the Valar]], and it is said that Tuor became reckoned in the kindred of the Elves, so that they both live in [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

== Etymology ==




The name Idril is the [[Sindarin]] form of her [[Quenya]] name ''Itarildë'' (or ''Itarillë''), which means "Sparkling Brilliance".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''ril''</ref>

She was called [[Celebrindal]], "Silver-foot", because she always went barefoot.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>
