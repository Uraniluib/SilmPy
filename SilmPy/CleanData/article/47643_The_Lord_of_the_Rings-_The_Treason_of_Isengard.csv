==Cancellation==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings- The Treason of Isengard - Witch-King Concept Art.jpg|thumb|300px|Concept art of the [[Witch-king]].]]{{Blockquote|Scheduled for release in Q4 2003, Treason of Isengard was dropped from the release schedule when it was determined that the game was not shaping up as strongly as anticipated and would likely not satisfy the expectations of Tolkien fans.<br/><br/>Vivendi Universal Games remains committed to developing and releasing quality games based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien, and we look forward to the release of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring this November, as well as Middle-Earth Online next year.|Official statement of [[Vivendi Universal]]<ref name="Gamespot-interview"/>}}

Treason of Isengard was cancelled in september 2003. In an interview with [[wikipedia:Gamespot|Gamespot]], Andrew Shiozaki, senior brand manager of Vivendi, explained that Vivendi had reviewed their complete line-up of [[Middle-earth]] video games, which besides Treason of Isengard included ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', the [[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|''War of the Ring'' strategy game]] and the MMORPG ''[[Middle-earth Online]]'' (which eventually was released as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' by [[Turbine]]). It was deemed that Treason of Isengard failed the standards that Vivendi had set for their Middle-earth video games and was therefore cancelled. Instead, they focussed on the remaining three video games.<ref name="Gamespot-interview"/>

==Soundtrack==
Brad Spear, who previously composed music for the ''Fellowship of the Ring'' video game, composed original music for Treason of Isengard, as well as tracks based on themes composed by [[Chance Thomas]] for ''[[Middle-earth Online]]'' (which later became known as ''The Lord of the Rings Online''). Several music demo's were available for download on the - now offline - site <nowiki>www.lotr.com</nowiki><!-- , this included tracks known as "The Elves Return to the Sea" and "The Battle of Pelennor Fields".<ref> http://www.assemblergames.com/forums/showthread.php?50475-LOTR-Treason-of-Isengard-(Unreleased)-Demo </ref> (needs checking)-->.
