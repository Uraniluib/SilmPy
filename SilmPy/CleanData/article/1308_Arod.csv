'''Arod''' was a light horse of [[Rohan]]. It bore a Knight of Rohan in [[Éomer]]'s [[éored]] that engaged the [[Orcs]] outside [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]]. His rider was lost during the skirmish, but Arod himself survived and remained with the rest of the éored on their way back. In [[the Wold]], Éomer gave him to [[Legolas]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> 

Arod served his new rider faithfully, and for much of this time, Arod carried also Legolas's friend [[Gimli]]. At the [[Paths of the Dead]] Legolas spoke [[Elvish]] to calm the beast so that it would enter the [[Dark Door]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> Presumably he bore Legolas on his way throughout the [[War of the Ring]] and during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Arod"</ref>
==Etymology==
In [[Old English]] which represents [[Rohirric]], the name means simply 'quick, swift'.<ref name=guide/>

By coincidence, there is also a [[Sindarin]] word ''arod'' meaning "noble"<ref>{{VT|41}} p.9</ref>.
==Portrayal in adaptations==
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'', Arod is played by a white stallion named Percy. According to [[Orlando Bloom]], it was the friendliest horse on the set.
