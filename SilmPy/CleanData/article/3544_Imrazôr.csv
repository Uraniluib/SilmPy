'''Imrazôr''' was a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] [[Prince]] of [[Belfalas]] at the end of the second millennium of the [[Third Age]]. He was said to have wedded an [[Elves|Elf-maid]] named [[Mithrellas]], a wandering companion of [[Nimrodel]]. His son [[Galador]] was the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ''Amroth and Nimrodel''</ref>
==Etymology==
The meaning of the name is not known, however it includes [[Adûnaic]] ''[[zôr]]'' which means "flame" or "foam".

The first element ''imra'' (perhaps from *''imar'') is not translated but it also appears in the name [[Imrahil]] and perhaps [[Imâr]].
