==Summary==
Tolkien said that [[Houghton Mifflin]]'s ''[[The Two Towers]]'' blurb must have been written by someone who had not read the book, but relied on hearsay inaccurately remembered.  "Giving away the plot" is silly and unnecessary; but at least the plot given away might be for the book described.
