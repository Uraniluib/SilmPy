'''Belegund''' ({{FA|422}}-{{FA|460|n}}) was a descendent of [[Bëor]], and a member of [[Barahir's Outlaw Band]].
__NOTOC__
== History ==
Belegund was the younger son and third child of [[Bregolas]]. His brother was [[Baragund]] who was elder to him, and his sister was [[Beleth]] who was the eldest among his siblings. Belegund had only one daughter, [[Rían]], with an unnamed wife.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) House of Bëor'',  p. 231</ref> Belegund and his brother Baragund partook in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] under the command of their uncle [[Barahir]] who was their father's brother. They survived, but were beaten back.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> With Barahir and ten others, they formed a small band and lived as [[Barahir's Outlaw Band|outlaws]] in [[Dorthonion]], near [[Tarn Aeluin]]. 

They lived in hiding for some time, until [[Morgoth]]'s agents captured [[Gorlim]] and coerced him into giving the location of their hideaway. [[Orcs]] were sent to raid it, and succeeded. Belegund and the outlaws were killed. Only [[Beren]] survived, as he had been away on an errand.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>
Belegund was the grandfather of [[Tuor]] by Rían his daughter.
