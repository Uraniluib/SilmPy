'''Ascar''' was the northernmost of the rivers that flowed through [[Ossiriand]]. It emerged near [[Dolmed]] and, the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] from the [[Blue Mountains]] lay along its northern bank, until it met [[Gelion]] at [[Sarn Athrad]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> 
==History==
After the murder of King [[Thingol]] of Doriath the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] easily entered [[Menegroth]] where they [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|ransacked]] and plundered the halls, retaking the [[Nauglamír]]. The victorious Dwarves marched along the banks of the Ascar with their spoils.  Suddenly, [[Beren]], [[Dior]] his son, and a host of [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] attacked the Dwarves.  After the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] Beren reclaimed the Nauglamír, but had the rest of the treasure of Doriath cast into the Ascar.  From that time forth the river was renamed [[Rathlóriel]] ("Goldenbed").<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Asgar'' in [[Noldorin]] means "rushing" or "impetuous",<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Ascar''</ref> derived from [[Sundocarme|root]] A-[[SKAR]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, ''Ascar'' is referred to as ''Baening''. [[Christopher Tolkien]] tentatively interpreted the O.E. name as "river filled with bones (of the Dwarves)", but doubted that it was his father's intended meaning.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

The name ''Rathlóriel'' means "Golden-bed".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> In the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', the name ''Rath Loriel'' is said to contain the [[Noldorin]] word ''[[Rath#Noldorin|rath]]'' ("coarse, river-bed") and ''[[glaur|lor-]]'' ("gold").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 368, 383</ref><ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 11</ref>
