Academy Award-nominated American actor '''Brad Dourif''' (born 1950) played [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].

Throughout the filming he stayed totally in character, and only after [[Peter Jackson]] called "cut" for the last time did he drop the accent he adopted for the role. When Jackson heard his real accent, he assumed Dourif was just joking around.

==Quotes==
{{quote|What got me excited to do Grima Wormtongue is when I was young I went through a period in boarding school were I was picked on alot. And there is something about Grima, he has been picked on when he was a kid, he (Grima) is so distrustful, he is so easily corrupted, He is so ugly, and he wants somebody, he wants to love somebody, and he can't, because nobody will have him.|Brad Dourif,  ICON 20, March 31st, 2001}}
