The '''Nauglamír''' or '''Necklace of the Dwarves''' was a famed piece of jewellery; combined with the craft of [[Dwarves]] and gems from [[Valinor]] it was of great grace and beauty which it gave to its wearer. Despite being loaded with gems, it sat lightly on the neck.<ref name=return/>

It bore the [[Silmaril]] rescued by [[Beren]] from the [[Iron Crown]], and it became jewellery more beautiful than anything ever before seen in [[Arda]]. But because of the Silmaril it was coveted by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] and entangled in the [[Doom of the Noldor]]. 

==History==
The Nauglamír was made for [[Finrod]] by [[Dwarves]] of the [[Ered Luin]] and was the most renowned of their works in that age. They fastened on it gems that Finrod brought from [[Valinor]].<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref> It was his most prized treasure in Nargothrond and the most famed Dwarven work of the [[Elder Days]].<ref name=doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

During and after the [[Fall of Nargothrond]]<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> the Nauglamír remained therefore forgotten in the hoard of [[Glaurung]]. [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] found it and brought the famous treasure to the Kingdom of [[Doriath]], and threw it on the floor, bitterly "thanking" [[Thingol]] for fostering [[Turin Turambar|his son]] and [[Morwen|wife]]. When Húrin left, [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] had been invited to [[Menegroth]] by Thingol and decided to refashion it and fasten the [[Silmaril]] of [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]] on it.<ref name=doriath/>

The Dwarves were enthralled by its gems and of course the Silmaril, and demanded it from Thingol, claiming it as just payment for their labours. Thingol realized that they wished to possess the Silmaril, and sent them from Doriath without any payment, an event which led directly to his murder. The Dwarves fled, only to be slaughtered by the avenging Elves who killed all but two and returned the Nauglamír to Doriath. However a great host from [[Nogrod]], roused to war, and begun the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves]], stealing the entire treasure of Doriath including the Nauglamír. But they were waylaid by Beren Erchamion at [[Sarn Athrad]]. The Dwarves were all [[Battle of Sarn Athrad|slain]], and the treasure was cast into the [[Ascar|River Ascar]], except for the Nauglamír, which Beren took to Lúthien.<ref name=doriath/> 

Lúthien wore the Nauglamír for the rest of her life, their combining beauty being the fairest beauty east of Valinor. At her second death, a Lord of the [[Green-elves]] brought it to her son, [[Dior]], back to Doriath; but when the [[Sons of Fëanor]] heard about its whereabouts, they attacked Doriath in an attempt to claim the Silmaril in the [[Second Kinslaying]] where Dior was killed. This attempt failed, as Dior's daughter [[Elwing]] fled to the [[Havens of Sirion]] saving the Nauglamír.<ref name=doriath/>

The Sons of Fëanor were still after the Silmaril, and attacked the Mouths of Sirion, resulting in the [[Third Kinslaying]]. Elwing cast herself into the sea with it. It is not known what happened to the Nauglamír, but Elwing and the Silmaril were saved by [[Ulmo]] who brought her in the hands of Eärendil; it was its light that guided him through the [[Shadowy Seas]] and he found his way to Valinor. The [[Valar]] then set this Silmaril as a Star and worn on his brow.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>

==Etymology and Names==

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] the word ''nauglamîr'' is listed as [[Doriathrin]],<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 373 (root [[MIR|MIR-]])</ref> while the true [[Noldorin]] idiom is said to be ''[[Mîr]] [[Na (Sindarin)|na]] [[naug|Nauglin]]'' or ''Nauglvir'' (-> ''Nauglavir'').<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 375 (note that [[Christopher Tolkien]] uses the capitalized form of ''Mîr'' in the Index; cf. p. 442)</ref>s 

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two'', the Nauglamír, then called ''Nauglafring'', is more important: it more directly causes the death of Thingol as it gets caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the Girdle of [[Melian]] and is attacked by the Dwarves. Thingol, unhorsed, is slain, after which Melian's protection is lifted and Doriath is sacked.<ref name=lt2iv>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

The old form of the Nauglamír, the ''Nauglafring'' is in [[Goldogrin]]. The first element is ''naugl-'', "dwarf", and the second element is ''fring'', "carcanet, necklace".<ref name=lt2iv/><ref>{{LT2|IVn}}</ref>
