'''The Timeless Halls''' are the dwelling of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], as distinct from the [[Void]]. They have existed before and outside the boundaries of the [[Eä|universe]], and may or may not have a physical form. Although without limit, they are said to stretch from the [[Abyss]] to the [[Firmament]].

In [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] [[Song of Eärendil]], the [[Ilmarin|halls]] of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]] are referred to as "The Timeless Halls."
