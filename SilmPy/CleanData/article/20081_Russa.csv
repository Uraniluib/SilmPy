__NOTOC__
'''''russa''''' is a [[Quenya]] adjective which means "red-haired" or "russet".
==Etymology==
It obviously derives from a [[root]] *RUS-. See [[RUSKÄ€]]<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 385</ref>
==Examples==
*[[Ambarussa]]
*[[Minyarussa]]
*[[Atyarussa]]
* [[Russandol]] = Copper-Top
==See also==
*''[[russe]]''
==Inspiration==
The word ''russa'' represents the color called "russet" in English, which derives from the Latin word ''[[Wiktionary:russus|russus]]'' "red". Although we can't know if the similarities between the Quenya word and ''russet/russus'' were intentional by Tolkien, it is possible that they are.
