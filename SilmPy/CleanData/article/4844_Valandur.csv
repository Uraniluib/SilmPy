'''Valandur''' ({{TA|462}}<ref name=elendil>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref>-{{TA|652|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> age 190 years) was the eighth [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
In {{TA|552|n}} he had a son, Elendur.<ref name=elendil/> He succeeded his father, [[Tarondor (King of Arnor)|Tarondor]], to the throne in {{TA|602|n}}. 

Little record remained of his reign of fifty years, except that it was cut short in {{TA|652}} when he died prematurely. He was first and only King of [[Arnor]] after [[Isildur]] who died violently.<ref group=note>This is deduced from the dagger symbol (†) next to his death date in the [[Appendix A]], although the narrative doesn't mention anything about his life.</ref>

He was succeeded by his son, [[Elendur (King of Arnor)|Elendur]], upon his death.<ref name="North"/>
==Etymology==
Valandur's name is [[Quenya]] for "Servant of the Valar" from ''[[Valar]]'', and the suffix ''[[dur|-dur]]'' meaning "servant of, devoted to".
