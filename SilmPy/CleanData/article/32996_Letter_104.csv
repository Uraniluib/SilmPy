==Summary==
For the first time Tolkien dined at the [[Wikipedia:Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] high table, which had been very agreeable but odd.  The dons met, chatted amiably, and when enough were there then grace was said.  They then sat, dined, drank port, had coffee, smoked, and read newspapers.  All agreeably informal but shocking to one accustomed to the severer ceremonies and strict precedence of medi√¶val [[Wikipedia:Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke]].
