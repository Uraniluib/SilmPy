'''''anca'''''<ref group="note">Both the forms ''anka'' and ''anca'' occur in the published ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' (cf. {{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 348, 374). However, in the corrigenda to ''The Etymologies'', it is suggested that [[Christopher Tolkien]] had made a misreading of the original manuscript or that a printing error had occurred: the form used in both places is actually ''anka'' (cf. {{VT|45a}}, p. 5). Although this is the only attested occurrence of ''anka/anca''<!-- As known to User:Morgan, as of 29 November 2010 -->, the latter form is used on [[Tolkien Gateway]] in order to have a regularized Quenya spelling (''c'' for ''k'', in line with [[Helge Fauskanger]]'s use in [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/wordlists.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo (Quenya Wordlists] (accessed 29 November 2010).</ref> is a noun meaning "jaws" in [[Quenya]].<ref name="Names">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref>
