By tradition, the [[Éored|Riders of Rohan]] were led by three marshals of the Riddermark. These were named, in descending order of seniority, the [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|First]], Second and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshal]]s. In the early years of the reign of [[Théoden]], the seventeenth King of Rohan, he had taken the role of First Marshal himself, but in the years of his decline there was effectively no Rider in this post. The next rank, that of Second Marshal, was held by Théoden's son [[Théodred]], whose command was based at [[Helm's Deep]]. 

Théodred's men were defeated by [[Saruman]]'s forces at the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], in which Théodred himself was slain. After that time, the traditional ranks were no longer strictly adhered to. Théodred's post as Second Marshal was effectively filled by [[Elfhelm]], though he was never given the official title. After the [[War of the Ring]], [[Éomer]] (formerly the Third Marshal of the Mark), now King of Rohan after Théoden was killed at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], completely revised the old tradition of the three marshals, and instead gave Elfhelm the title of [[Marshal of the East-mark]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>
