'''Turgon''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2855|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref> – {{TA|2953|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 98 years) was the twenty-fourth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Turgon was the son of Steward [[Túrin II]]. As many of the Ruling Stewards were named after legendary figures of the [[First Age]]<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 203</ref> Turgon was named after [[Turgon]], the [[Hidden King]] of [[Gondolin]]. Unlike his father's reign (and his son's), his rule was apparently peaceful and uneventful, as no significant events for Gondor are recorded during those thirty-nine years.

However, it was near the end of his rule, in {{TA|2951}}, when [[Sauron]] declared himself openly in [[Mordor]]; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding [[Barad-dûr]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

His son [[Ecthelion II|Ecthelion]] succeeded him to the throne.
