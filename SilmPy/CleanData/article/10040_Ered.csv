==Other versions==
''ered'' is the plural form used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in his writings of the 1930s and 1940s (including ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') and by [[Christopher Tolkien]] in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''. In his later work on the Silmarillion in the 1950s and 60s, J.R.R. Tolkien often used the plural form '''''eryd''''' instead, for example ''Eryd Lindon''<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 385</ref> and ''Eryd Gorgoroth''<ref>{{MR|P3II9}}, p. 297</ref> replacing earlier ''[[Ered Lindon]]'' and ''[[Ered Gorgoroth]]''.

In the normal pluralization rules of [[Sindarin]], the form ''eryd'' would be the proper plural, because an ''o'' in the final syllable of a singular noun became ''y'' in the plural, such as ''emyn'' the plural of ''[[amon]]'' "hill" and ''gelydh'' the plural of ''[[golodh]]'' "Noldo". To explain the presence of ''ered'' in ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien considered modifying the internal history of the Sindarin pluralization, so that the ''y''-plurals of the [[First Age]] had changed to ''e'' by the [[Third Age]], except in limited cases such as before nasals like ''n'' and ''m'' (to explain ''emyn'', which also appeared in ''The Lord of the Rings'').<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 33</ref><ref group=note> Tolkien even noted: "Use ''Eryd'' in ''Silmarillion''" ([[Parma Eldalamberon 17|PE17]], p. 33). Perhaps Christopher used ''Ered'' in ''The Silmarillion'' to be consistent with ''The Lord of the Rings''.</ref>
