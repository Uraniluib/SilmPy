'''Dwimorberg''' or '''Haunted Mountain''' was one of the [[White Mountains]]. To the west, there was the ancient hold of [[Dunharrow]] overlooking [[Harrowdale]] from the east.<ref name="Passing">{{RK|V2}}</ref>

The mountain was brooding and black. On its lower slopes was the wood of [[Dimholt]]. Beyond its glen and behind a single standing stone, was the [[Dark Door]], which led inside the Dwimorberg and the haunted [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref name="Passing"/> 

The [[wraiths]] of the [[Oathbreakers]] haunted the mountain, giving it its name. After [[Aragorn]] redeemed them, the Dwimorberg was haunted no longer.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name means "haunted mountain" in [[Old English]], representing the [[Rohan language]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 101</ref> from ''[[Wiktionary:dwimor#Old_English|dwimor]]'' "phantom, ghost" + ''[[Wiktionary:beorg#Old_English|beorg]]'' "mountain". 

The first element, from which the English word ''dwimmer'' derives, is also seen in the Rohanese names ''[[Dwimordene]]'' ([[Lothl√≥rien]]) and ''[[Dwimmerlaik]]'' ([[Witch-king]]).
