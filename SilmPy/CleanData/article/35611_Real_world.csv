The relationship between the '''real world''' and [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[EÃ¤]], or the relationship between the real-world history and the stories of the [[legendarium]], is a matter of debate. Or rather, several. As the legendarium encompasses everything from the [[Ainulindale|creation of the described world]] to [[Dagor Dagorath|its end]], the debates include a very wide variety of subjects. The forums on the world wide web maintained by fans, [[tolkienists]] or [[Tolkien_Societies|local Tolkien societies]] are a place for the discussions on these subjects, but there exists also private blogs and newspapers in which the subjects maybe developed and published. Full list of discussions about the relationship is likely impossible to make, so here we could just list some of the common themes of these.
