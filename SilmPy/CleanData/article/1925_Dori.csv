'''Dori''' was a Dwarf who, being of [[Durin's Folk]], probably dwelt in the northern [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the latter had settled there after [[Thráin|Thráin II]] had disappeared.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]], and after the successful conclusion of this quest he lived with his part of the treasure at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

Dori's parentage is unknown although he was a member of the [[House of Durin]] and a remote kinsman of Thorin.<ref name="Durin"/>  His birth year is also unknown.  However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years"<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing, [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>  Since Fíli was born in {{TA|2859}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Dori's birth between 2809 and {{TA|2763|n}}, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.  Thorin stated that Dori was the strongest of the Dwarves in the company.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>  Dori (and [[Nori]]) shared Bilbo's opinion that meals should be plentiful and frequent.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

==The Quest of Erebor==
When Bilbo first met Dori (in the fourth group of Dwarves to arrive at [[Bag End]]) he was wearing a purple hood.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Dori (along with Nori and [[Ori]]) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

Bilbo proclaimed Dori to be "really a decent fellow"<ref name="Pan">{{H|Pan}}</ref> because thrice Dori assisted Bilbo when the hobbit might otherwise have been killed:  First, Dori carried Bilbo in the tunnels of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the escape from the goblins, but unfortunately dropped him;<ref name="Hill"/> the other Dwarves later blamed him for losing their burglar.  Second, during the escape from the [[Wargs]], Dori climbed down from a tree, which allowed Bilbo to scramble up Dori and into the tree.  Lastly, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as they were carried off by an eagle, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins.<ref name="Pan"/>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Dori and Thorin were the first two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Thorin also notes that Dori is the strongest of their company. Upon being pulled out of the barrel after escaping the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s halls, Dori was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed only half alive.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Dori later fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

==Erebor==
Dori lived a very rich life after the quest as one of the reclaimers of the mountain.  He was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]],<ref name="Meetings"/> and may have fought in the [[Battle of Dale]].  His date of death is not known.

==Etymology==
''Dóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "Borer" or "auger-man".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

:{{Blockquote|A distant relative of Thorin Oakenshield, Dori is the eldest amongst his brothers Ori and Nori. He is the strongest in The Company of Dwarves, and spends much of his time watching out for Ori, making sure he hasn’t caught a chill or gotten himself killed by Wargs or Goblins. Eternally pessimistic, with a natural tendency to expect the worst, Dori is nonetheless quite prepared to risk life and limb in order to get the job done.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="HobbitApp">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}
