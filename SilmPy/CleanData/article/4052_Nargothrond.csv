'''Nargothrond''' was the stronghold built by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] which delved into the banks of the river [[Narog]] in [[Beleriand]].  

Nargothrond was the capital of the '''realm of Nargothrond'''<Ref group=note>The name appears only in the map accompanying ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In the text, the realm is mentioned with miniscule letters.</ref> between [[Nenning]], Narog and [[Teiglin]], including the surrounding hills of [[Taur-en-Faroth]] and the [[Talath Dirnen]] to the north, as well as [[Tumhalad]]. Finrod was the overlord of all the [[Elves]] in the [[West Beleriand]], except the [[Falathrim]].<ref>{{S|Realms}}</ref><ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> 

==History==
===Creation===
On the western bank of the river [[Narog]], beneath the forested hills of Taur-en-Faroth, the Caverns of Narog were first known as [[Nulukkizdîn]], secretly inhabited by the [[Petty-dwarves]] before they were driven out.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> What became of the Petty-Dwarves at this time is not recorded, but at least some escaped to dwell in [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref>

After the return of the [[Noldor]] to [[Middle-earth]], King [[Thingol]] described the Caverns to his kinsman [[Finrod]]. Inspired by [[Menegroth]] in [[Doriath]], and seeking a hidden place from which to be safe from the forces of [[Morgoth]], Finrod chose those caves to build his great underground fortress, and established Nargothrond. He was aided by the [[Dwarves]] of the [[Ered Luin]], who also made for him the [[Nauglamír]], the Necklace of the Dwarves and gave him his famous epithet, ''Felagund'', Hewer of Caves. Finrod rewarded them with treasures he brought from [[Tirion]].<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref>

Finrod also raised an artificial hill, [[Amon Ethir]], a league far from the gates of Nargothrond.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

===Days of Power===

Finrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined [[Beren]] in his quest for the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] and handed rule to [[Orodreth]].  However, since the [[Dagor Bragollach]] [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the sons of [[Fëanor]], were defeated and retreated to Nargothrond where they were received as one of them.  Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher.  Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at the time Finrod departed with Beren and were more powerful than Orodreth until Finrod's death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

===Fall===

(''Main article: [[Fall of Nargothrond]]'')

[[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] later came to Nargothrond and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Morgoth (the bridge was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the dragon [[Glaurung]].

===Afterwards===
[[Glaurung]] stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to [[Brethil]] to assail Túrin and was killed by him at [[Cabed-en-Aras]].  Then, [[Mîm]] the Petty-dwarf settled there reclaiming his people's ancient home until he was killed by [[Húrin]]. Húrin entered the dark caves where the treasures Finrod brought from [[Valinor]] still lay there, but he brought out the [[Nauglamir]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> 

The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Age until the [[War of Wrath]] when it went down with the rest of Beleriand.

==Etymology==
From its first conception, the name '''Nargothrond''' means "Underground fortress on the river [[Narog]]". Its [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarvish]] name was '''[[Nulukkizdîn|Nulukkhizdîn]]''' (erronously spelled ''Nulukkizdîn'' in the published works).<ref>{{WJ|10}}</ref>

However, in his later life, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] devised the Dwarvish name ''Nar(u)kathan'' instead, to which the Elves suffixed ''-[[rond]]'', "vaulted dome".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Nargothrond is referred as ''Hlydingaburg'' "City of the Hlydingas" or ''Stangaldor(burg)''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
