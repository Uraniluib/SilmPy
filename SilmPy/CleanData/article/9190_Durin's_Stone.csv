'''Durin's Stone''' was a pillar that stood on the banks of [[Mirrormere]] lake near the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria|East-gate]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

According to the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]], it was built on the site where [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] looked down in the lake and saw [[Durin's Crown|a crown]] above his head; its purpose was to mark the event. It was ornamented with [[Angerthas Moria|runes]]. By the later [[Third Age]] the stone was broken, cracked and heavily weathered.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>

[[Balin]] was slain on that spot in {{TA|2994}}.
