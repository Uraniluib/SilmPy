}}'''Tolkien Gateway''' (or simply '''TG''') is a not-for-profit collaborative [[wikipedia:wiki|wiki]] devoted to the [[Index:Writings by J.R.R. Tolkien|works]] of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], being the largest Tolkien-related encyclopedia on the [[wikipedia:World Wide Web|World Wide Web]].<ref name="List">"[[List of Tolkien Encyclopedias|List of Tolkien Encyclopedias]]", based on research by [[User:Mith|Mith]] (accessed [[19 November|November 19]] [[2010]])</ref> It strives to be the most extensive and complete online resource with content relating not just to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] but also information on Tolkien-related images, adaptations, people, places, events, societies, and other works of scholarly and academic interest.

Although still criticised for its "wiki" ethos, Tolkien Gateway's growth and increased scholarship have been lauded by Tolkien scholars in recent years.<ref name="Tolkienseminariet"/> Its increased status has led to greater popularity as Tolkien Gateway is now the most popular Tolkien website in the world, ahead of [[TheOneRing.net]] and [[The Tolkien Society]].<ref name="Alexa">[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tolkiengateway.net Alexa - tolkiengateway.net] (accessed [[7 January]] 2017)</ref> Tolkien Gateway is recognised as one of the world's largest wikis, ranking 647th in the world by total number of articles, 508th by total number of edits and 361st by total number of images.<ref name="WikiStats">[http://wikistats.wmflabs.org/largest_html.php?s=good_desc&th=10000&lines=750 WikiStats - List of largest MediaWikis] (accessed 6 July 2014)</ref>

Inspired by the release of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Tolkien Gateway was founded by [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] on [[1 January|January 1]], [[2003]] as [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net], then [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.tk http://tolkiengateway.tk], before eventually opening up as [http://tolkiengateway.net http://tolkiengateway.net] on [[3 June|June 3]], [[2005]]. Tolkien Gateway uses the same [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki MediaWiki] software as [http://www.wikia.com Wikia] and [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] whilst operating a [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU-FDL] licence. Tolkien Gateway has a [http://wikiindex.org/Category:WikiFactor wikifactor] of 129.<ref>[[wikipedia:WikiFactor|From Wikipedia]]: "The wikiFactor is simply the number of pages in the wiki (wF) that have had more than 1000 times wF visits."</ref>

===History by year===
====2003====
Inspired by the recent release of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] created TolkienGateway on [[1 January|January 1]], [[2003]] as a community and an encyclopedia at [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net]. Sporting a tan-coloured skin, TolkienGateway made use of the free [http://www.phpnuke.org/ PHP-Nuke] software.<ref name="Archive CJB">[http://web.archive.org Internet Archive: Wayback Machine], "[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net http://tolkiengateway.cjb.net]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

In [[February]], Hyarion decide to move the web-hosting of TolkienGateway from [http://Angelfire.com Angelfire] to [http://FuturePoint.com FuturePoint]. By [[August]], Hyarion migrated to the free, and more aesthetically-pleasing, domain of [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.tk http://tolkiengateway.tk].<ref name="Archive TK">[http://web.archive.org Internet Archive: Wayback Machine], "[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tolkiengateway.tk http://tolkiengateway.tk]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

====2004====
[[File:TG-logo.gif|thumb|right|Tolkien Gateway's original logo]]
On [[6 November|November 6]], Hyarion purchased the domain [http://tolkiengateway.net http://tolkiengateway.net] and begins work on creating a proper wiki. By [[March]] [[2005]], the original TolkienGateway has gone offline so Hyarion can focus on the new website.<ref name="Archive TK"/>

====2005====
In [[January]] [[2005]] Tolkien Gateway's [[Tolkien Gateway:Chat|IRC chat]] was opened; this enabled both Tolkien Gateway editors and users from other websites to congregate in a single place for discussion of their respective websites and the works of Tolkien.<ref name="Chat">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Chat]] (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> Tolkien Gateway's IRC, [irc://irc.tolkiengateway.net irc://irc.tolkiengateway.net], is still in use today.

After a long hiatus, Tolkien Gateway opened to the public on [[3 June|June 3]] with Hyarion as the sole administrator and bureaucrat. In order for Tolkien Gateway to have a sizeable number of articles ready for its released, many were copied from either [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/ The Encyclopedia of Arda] or [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle-earth|Wikipedia]]; this has since been criticised by later editors who have struggled to identify and update all such articles.<ref name="Meeting 5Sep">See "[[Tolkien Gateway talk:Meetings/5 September 2010#Ideas for Agenda]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

Notable editors during this time include [[User:BrightSideoftheDark|BrightSideoftheDark]], [[User:Bokkie|Bokkie]], [[User:Elemmakil|Elemmakil]], [[User:Gandalf|Gandalf]], [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] and [[User:Tik|Tik]].

====2006====
On [[1 January|January 1]] [[2006]] Hyarion opened a second website, [[Tolkien News]], as a another source of information, in competition with [http://www.theonering.net TheOneRing.net], but without the commercial advertising. The website closed in [[2008]].

Technically, 2006 was a very important year for Tolkien Gateway: it saw the introduction of the fresh Cavendish skin, the creation of a forum for editors to discuss important issues, a community portal, and the ability to embed video. Furthermore, 2006 witnessed impressive growth in page views: from less than 200,000 page views at the start of the year to a million by October, by this point Tolkien Gateway was also witnessing 3,000 pages views per day.<ref name="2006u">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates#2006]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

2006 also witnessed modest growth in members from about 180 at the start of year to 422 at the end of the end of the year.<ref name="April2007"/> Important editors during this time include [[User:Ardamir|Ardamir]], [[User:Earendilyon|Earendilyon]], [[User:Ebakunin|Ebakunin]], [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]], [[User:Mith|Mith]], [[User:Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas|Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas]], [[User:Tar-Telperien|Tar-Telperien]] and [[User:Tik|Tik]].

====2007====
[[File:TG 2006.png|left|thumb|Tolkien Gateway in July 2006]]Although technically relatively uneventful, [[2007]] saw attempts by Hyarion to increase Tolkien Gateway's user base and reach. In particular, coinciding with the release of ''[[The Children of HÃºrin]]'' Hyarion arranged [[The Children of HÃºrin Release Party]] an online gathering of artists, collectors, scholars and fans to celebrate the publication of this fresh story; a record-breaking 69 new users joined Tolkien Gateway in [[April]] 2007 as a result of this.<ref name="April2007">Personal research by [[User:Mith|Mith]]</ref> Coinciding with The Children of HÃºrin Release Party, Hyarion also introduced [http://tolkiengateway.net/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=42029 a brand new Main Page layout] which still remains the basis for the current [[Main Page]].

On [[4 October|October 4]], Hyarion introduced interwiki links allowing Tolkien Gateway's English articles to be connected to the fellow wikis [http://ardapedia.herr-der-ringe-film.de/index.php/Hauptseite Ardapedia] (German) and [http://kontu.wiki/Etusivu Kontu] (Finnish).<ref name="Interwiki">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]]", entry 10-4-07 (accessed [[20 November|November 20]], [[2010]])</ref> Since then, interwiki links have also been expanded to the French website [http://www.tolkiendil.com/encyclo Tolkiendil] and Farsi website [http://wiki.valimar.ir/index.php?title=%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D9%87%D9%94_%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%DB%8C Valimar].

Influential editors during this period include [[User:Dr Death|Dr Death]], [[User:Dwarf Lord|Dwarf Lord]], [[User:Earendilyon|Earendilyon]], [[User:Elemmakil|Elemmakil]] [[User:Fleela|Fleela]], [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]], [[User:Mith|Mith]], [[User:Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas|Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas]], [[User:Tar-Telperien|Tar-Telperien]], [[User:Theoden1|Theoden1]] and [[User:Tik|Tik]].

====2008====
[[File:TG 2008.png|thumb|right|Tolkien Gateway in June 2008]]
The first major event of [[2008]] was a server move, "''Due to the rapid growth of Tolkien Gateway we will be migrating to a new quad-core server with 8 gigs of RAM.''"<ref name="Updates Move">[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]], entry 1-29-08 (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> Tolkien Gateway moves server on roughly a year basis every time resulting in considerable downtime and residual problems; this move was no exception!<ref name="Updates" /> The following month, Tolkien Gateway was featured as the Site of the Week for the 8th February on the fan website [http://www.thereandbackagain.net/ ThereAndBackAgain.net]<ref>[http://www.thereandbackagain.net/ ThereAndBackAgain.net] (accessed=21 August 2014)</ref>

On [[30 April|April 30]], [[2008]] the first major extension to the wiki's content was the creation of [http://tolkiengateway.net/map/ a map] which seeks to list all the important locations in the world relevant to Tolkien's life, publications and adaptations.<ref name="Updates Map">[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]], entry 4-14-08 (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> The expansion of the wiki continues, reaching 7,000 articles by [[12 July|July 12]]<ref name="Updates 7000">[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]], entry 7-12-08 (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> whilst gaining an extra 366 members over the course of the year, taking the total membership to 788.<ref name="April2007" />

In the summer, Hyarion revealed to editors that [[Forum:One Wiki Merge|he had been in discussions]] with the administrators of [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page One Wiki to Rule Them All], the Tolkien encyclopedia of [http://www.wikia.com Wikia], to merge the two sites together. Although the proposal wasn't fully fleshed-out, members of both communities got so far as [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/LOTR:Merge_Vote registering their intention to vote] on the issue before Wikia staff decided they were unwilling to let go of their own site - the merger never took place.<ref name="Merge talk">"[[User talk:Hyarion#Merge]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> A happy side-effect, however, is that many One Wiki editors migrated permanently to Tolkien Gateway, including the One Wiki bureaucrat [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]].<ref name="Merge talk2">"[[User talk:Hyarion/Archive 4#Merge]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

{{Blockquote|what a shame. It's almost comical that they ignored the wiki until there were any talks of leaving, at which point they realized they'd be losing money so they now have all of their employees pretending to be active contributors. Anyway, we're moving past it, they are not worth the time|[[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] on [http://www.wikia.com Wikia]'s staff attitude towards a merger of Tolkien Gateway and [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page One Wiki to Rule Them All]<ref name="Merge talk2"/>}}

The second seminal event of 2008 was the introduction of [[Tolkien Gateway:Meetings|Meetings]]. The [[Tolkien Gateway:Meetings/17 August 2008|first meeting]] was held on August 17, 2008; following the first meeting, Tolkien Gateway saw its very first promotion of [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]] to [[Tolkien Gateway:Administrators|administrator]], an expansion of [[Tolkien Gateway:Projects|Projects]] to focus the activities of members, and a more extensive [[Tolkien Gateway:Community Portal|Community Portal]].<ref name="Meeting 1">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Meetings/17 August 2008]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref> Meetings continued on a weekly basis until [[October]].<ref name="Meetings">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Meetings]]" (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

On [[25 August]], [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]] contacted [[TheOneRing.net]] with a proposition that Tolkien Gateway and TheOneRing.net should work in co-operation. The general premise was that the two online Tolkien communities were consubstantial and should, therefore, work together for each other's benefit. The discussion was, at first, progressive; it was mooted that, in effect, Tolkien Gateway would become TheOneRing.net's encyclopaedia, and that TheOneRing.net would become Tolkien Gateway's news portal. However, discussions came to an end because of an apparent bad history between [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]], the owner of Tolkien Gateway, and TheOneRing.net. Whilst there was reciprocal praise for the work achieved by both communities, no further discussions took place.<ref>Personal research by [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]]</ref>

Finally, on [[26 August|August 26]], the "Gateway to Ithilien" was made the default skin for Tolkien Gateway, and - with minor alterations - still remains the default skin today.<ref name="Ithilien">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]]", entry 8-26-08 (accessed [[21 November|November 21]], [[2010]])</ref>

Top contributors during this period include [[User:Aule the Smith|Aule the Smith]], [[User:Dwarf Lord|Dwarf Lord]], [[User:Earendilyon|Earendilyon]], [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]], [[User:Eldarion Telcontar|Eldarion Telcontar]], [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]], [[User:Linathiel|Linathiel]], [[User:Mith|Mith]], [[User:Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas|Narfil PalÃ¹rfalas]], [[User:Quidon88|Quidon88]], [[User:Sage|Sage]], [[User:Ãelma|Ãelma]], [[User:Theoden1|Theoden1]], and [[User:Tik|Tik]] as well as [[User:KingAragorn Bot|KingAragorn Bot]]

====2009====
Apart from another difficult server move,<ref name="SM 2009">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]]", entry 9-2-09 (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> [[2009]] was a relatively uneventful year for Tolkien Gateway and its editors. Despite this, Tolkien Gateway gained the largest number of editors in any year (481),<ref name="April2007"/> as well as passing the threshold of 8,000 articles.

Frequent editors of 2009 include: [[User:Ebakunin|Ebakunin]], [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]], [[User:Eldarion Telcontar|Eldarion Telcontar]], [[User:Grond|Grond]], [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]], [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]], [[User:Mith|Mith]], [[User:Morgan|Morgan]], [[User:Mthomas|Mthomas]], [[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]], [[User:Ãelma|Ãelma]] and [[User:Sage|Sage]], as well as [[User:KingAragorn Bot|KingAragorn Bot]].

====2010====
[[File:TG 2010.png|thumb|left|Tolkien Gateway in November 2010]]
[[2010]] started eventfully for Tolkien Gateway as a new editor, [[User:Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]], including [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] declension templates in the majority of articles - this led to an intense discussion between Gilgamesh on the one hand, and [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]], [[User:Mith|Mith]] and [[User:Sage|Sage]] on the other (arguing that their appearance and canonicity were questionable). Eventually, all the templates were removed.<ref name="Quenya Template">"[[Forum:Quenya declension template appearance]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], 2010)</ref>

Despite reaching its fifth birthday (as a wiki) this was left uncelebrated by the editors. Indeed, [[Forum:The future of Tolkien Gateway|some editors expressed disquiet]] about existing technical problems, the paucity of editors and the inactivity of [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] with some editors suggesting that the project should be forked. Following this, Tolkien Gateway witness a re-emergence of its meetings,<ref name="Meetings"/> Hyarion became more active (updating the MediaWiki software), Ederchil was promoted to a bureaucrat and Mith was promoted to administrator/sysop.<ref name="MithPromote">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Requests for adminship/Archive#Mith (28/06/10)]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> It was also at this time that, with great reluctance,<ref name="Reluctance">"[[User talk:Ederchil#Anti-spam strategies]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> that members of the community decided to lock Tolkien Gateway to anonymous editors; this was in order to prevent the large numbers of spammers who were vandalising articles.<ref name="TG lock">"[[Forum:Database Lock]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref>

In the summer of 2010, [http://twitter.com/#!/kriskowal Kris Kowal] from [http://3rin.gs 3rin.gs] added links to Tolkien Gateway - alongside existing ones to [http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/ the Encyclopedia of Arda] - on his interactive map.<ref name="3rin.gs">"[https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0An5phhxDkYDPdFJFdkN3SGhCRDJpanM5YUZFY24tZnc&hl=en&authkey=CJee_rkM#gid=0 References for Middle-earth]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> 

During this time, many key projects were embarked upon by editors: the relatively new editor [[User:Morgan|Morgan]] working on bibliographical information;<ref name="Works">"[[Index:Writings by J.R.R. Tolkien|Writings by J.R.R. Tolkien]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> Mith working on the [[Timeline]] and years; Ederchil and Mith updated and expanded infoboxes; Mith and [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]] trying to remove five-years of redirected links (with the aid of their bots);<ref name="Redirects">"[[Forum:Linking to redirects]]" (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref><ref name="Redirects1">See "[https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AlmDTSjnmPrJdDFQSDU2QlMxN2hBYU80ZzVlemttVXc&hl=en_GB&authkey=CJeHxskG#gid=0 Redirects]" for progress (accessed [[24 November|November 24]], [[2010]])</ref> KingAragorn re-categorisation all location articles; [[User:Sage|Sage]] working on language-related articles; and [[User:Amroth|Amroth]] and [[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] working on video-games articles.

====2011====
[[File:TG-2012.png|thumb|Tolkien Gateway in January 2012]]
In November 2011, the esteemed auction firm Bonhams included a reference to the Tolkien Gateway article on [[Przemyslaw Mroczkowski]] in their lot description of a [[Letter to Przemyslaw Mroczkowski (9/10 November 1957)|1957 letter from J.R.R.

==Criticism==
:''See also: [[wikipedia:Wiki#Trustworthiness|Wiki#Trustworthiness]] and [[wikipedia:Criticism of Wikipedia|Criticism of Wikipedia]] for criticism of wikis in general''

Like other wikis, Tolkien Gateway has been criticised for the reliability of its information, its lack of sources and the frequency of its revisions. In particular, in the summer of [[2010]], Tolkien Gateway was criticised for confusing the two articles for [[Norman Power]] and [[Joseph Power]]; the prominent scholars [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] said:

{{Blockquote|The Tolkien Gateway entry for Norman Power makes a terrible hash of it by conjoining Norman and Joseph. How on earth could the writer think that someone said to be born in 1925 (Joseph) could be a student at Oxford in the late 1930s? [..] Well, call us old-fashioned (we do), and we admit to having only a passing knowledge of the ways of wiki-creation, but it would never occur to us to post a work-in-progress, to be cleaned up by someone else, especially since people often take wiki articles, in any state of completion, as gospel truth.|[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]<ref name="Power">[http://www.lotrplaza.com/ The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza], "[http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=229888#7238261 Brother Joseph Power's experiences of Tolkien, post #7238261]", dated [[26 July|July 26]], [[2010]] (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref><ref name="Power2">[http://www.lotrplaza.com/ The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza], "[http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=229888#7239909 Brother Joseph Power's experiences of Tolkien, post #7239909]", dated [[29 July|July 29]], [[2010]] (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref>}}

Despite [[User:Morgan|Morgan]] launching a defence of Tolkien Gateway on The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza, although accepting that Tolkien Gateway was better than other online encyclopaedias, the members generally complained about the unreliability of Tolkien Gateway - and wikis in general - and the ephemeral nature of the Internet, with an agreement that there was a "''distressing lack of sources''".<ref name="Plaza Critic">[http://www.lotrplaza.com/ The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza], "[http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=238638 The future of Tolkien knowledge]", dated [[30 July|July 30]] to [[11 August|August 11]] [[2010]] (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref> The article [http://tolkiengateway.net/w/index.php?title=English_and_Welsh&oldid=105660 English and Welsh] was paraded as a particularly bad example. In response to the criticisms raised, both the "Joseph Power"/"Norman Power" and "[[English and Welsh]]" articles were amended.<ref name="EandW">"[[Talk:English and Welsh]]" (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref>

In a review of Tolkien Gateway, Kristine Kastle claimed that it was only appropriate for the younger reader, it suffered from poor navigation, and the design was basic, lacking colour and that the life was sucked out of it; she gave Tolkien Gateway a score of 1.5 out of 4 which translates as, "''Well now at least the website is recognizable as a website; style is still not pretty much nonexistant.''"<ref name="Kastle">Kristine Kastle on [http://people.emich.edu/zgarrett/ColProject/ Collaborative Web Review], "[http://people.emich.edu/zgarrett/ColProject/3.html Tolkien Gateway Review]" (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref> The skin has been updated twice since the review although the navigation system has changed little.<ref name="Updates">"[[Tolkien Gateway:Updates]]" (accessed [[19 November|November 19]], [[2010]])</ref>

Commenting on Tolkien Gateway, Troels Forchhammer says that "''[i]t suffers from the same problems as any wiki when the subject is one of some fame or notoriety and in particular when the subject lends itself to strongly held opinions''". He also marks that Tolkien Gateway is "''trying to add thorough references to their articles, but has still a way to go''."<ref>[http://users.silenceisdefeat.net/~aft-rabt/links.html The Tolkien Newsgroups' Links Collection], dated 5 August 2008 (accessed 26 April 2011)</ref>

After a suggestion from [[User:Morgan]], [[Hawke Robinson]] and [[Michael Martinez]] discussed Tolkien Gateway on the ''Middle-earth Radio Talk Show'' on [[8 August]] [[2010]]. The radio hosts put forward a "''positive critique''", praising Tolkien Gateway for "''a great effort''", "''a nice layout''", and that the website should be "''recognized for all the work that has gone into this wiki''". However, they also addressed the issue that "''as all wikis, there's always room for improvement''", especially pointing out the need for "''better citation standards''".<ref>[http://middle-earthradio.com/talk-show/Middle-earth-Talk-Radio-Show-0029-2010-08-08.mp3/view Middle-earth Radion Talk Show, Episode 29] (dated 8 August 2010; from ca. 27:50) at [http://middle-earthradio.com/ Middle-earthradio.com]</ref>
