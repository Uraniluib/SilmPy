'''Rhûn''' refers to the little-known lands in eastern [[Middle-earth]]. Almost nothing of the lands beyond the great [[Sea of Rhûn]] is known (see [[Land of the Sun|Uttermost East]]).

==History==

The first Elves awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were led to the [[Westlands]] by [[Oromë]]. Some Elves forsook this [[Great Journey]] and chose to remain in the east; they were called the [[Avari]].

The first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met [[Dwarves]]<ref>{{WJ|Dwarves}}</ref> and Avari. The ancestors of the [[Edain]] and [[Drúedain]] traveled west out of Rhûn. At the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, some of the Mannish tribes traveling west separated and their languages soon diverged.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref> Other men remained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of [[Morgoth]] and, later, [[Sauron]]. These men were called [[Easterlings]], and they led many attacks against [[Gondor]] and its allies during the [[Third Age]].

In the [[Second Age|Second]] or [[Third Age]]s the [[Blue Wizards]] went into the deep regions of Rhûn, never to return<ref name="PMLast">{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-85</ref>. [[Saruman]] may have joined them before returning and occupying [[Isengard]]. During the [[Watchful Peace]], [[Sauron]] went to hiding in Rhûn for 400 years and gathered the Easterlings to his service; the Blue Wizards failed to discover his eastern stronghold.<ref name="PMLast"/>

The most western parts of Rhûn were conquered by Gondor twice, under the Kings [[Rómendacil I]] and [[Rómendacil II]], but the Númenóreans never had full control over it. Western Rhûn was finally subdued in the [[Fourth Age]] under [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and his son [[Eldarion]].

==Geography==
[[File:Stefano Baldo - Rhûn.jpg|thumb|left|''Rhûn'' by Stefano Baldo]]
The western part of Rhûn was given in maps of the [[Westlands]] of Middle-earth. It contained the great [[Sea of Rhûn]], connected the [[River Running]] in the northwest. A forest lay to the north-east of the Sea, and near the south-western shores there were many hills. South-west of the Sea of Rhûn lay also the land of [[Dorwinion]].

The inland [[Sea of Rhûn]] was located in western Rhûn on the border between Rhûn and [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. There were mountains on the southwest side of the Sea of Rhûn and a forest on the north-east side. Wild white [[Kine of Araw]], or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.

Further east in Rhûn were ancient regions where the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] first awoke: [[Cuiviénen]] for the Elves, which lay on the shores of [[Sea of Helcar]] near the [[Orocarni]] (Red Mountains); and [[Hildórien]] for Men. Four [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] clans were also located in Rhûn<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref>; their mansions were at least as far east from [[Mount Gundabad]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] as Mount Gundabad lay east of the [[Blue Mountains]]. Additionally, Sauron maintained a fortress in Rhûn in the Third Age.

===The Dwarves of Rhûn===

[[Dwarves]] emerged in Middle-earth in the [[Years of the Trees]]; after Elves but before Men. When the [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke in far-flung corners of Middle-earth, some of them found themselves in Rhûn, and there they founded kingdoms under the mountains of the [[East]]. The distance between their mansions in the East and the [[Misty Mountains]], specifically [[Gundabad]], was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance from the [[Blue Mountains]] in the West.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref> These four clans are the [[Ironfists]], [[Stiffbeards]], [[Blacklocks]] and [[Stonefoots]].<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref> In the [[Third Age]], Dwarves of those kingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf clans in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], which was fought in and under the [[Misty Mountains]]. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word '''''rhûn''''' means "east" in [[Sindarin]]. Compare [[Quenya]] ''[[rómen]]''.<ref>{{App|E2i}}</ref>

==Other  of the legendarium==

In an addition by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] (dating from [[1948]] or later) inscribed on his ''[[General Map of Middle-earth]]'', an arrow is drawn from the [[River Running]] with the direction to the end of the map, and carries the note: "To Sea of Rûnaer". [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] suggest that '''''Rûnaer''''' is likely an alternative name of ''Rhûn''.<ref>{{HM|AoL}}, p. 199</ref>

==Inspiration==
Rhûn and the easternmost lands of Middle-earth seem to be based primarily on the lands of [[Wikipedia:South Asia|southern]], [[Wikipedia:Central Asia|central]], and [[Wikipedia:East Asia|eastern Asia]].

In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bilbo offered to walk from the [[The Shire|Shire]] "to ''[cancelled: [[Wikipedia:Hindu Kush|Hindu Kush]]]'' the [[Wikipedia:Gobi Desert|Great Desert of Gobi]] and fight the Wild Wire worm(s) of the [[Wikipedia:China|Chinese]]."<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 9</ref> In a slightly later version [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] altered this to say "to the last desert in the East and fight the Wild Wireworms of the Chinese",<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 40</ref> and in the final version it was altered once more to say "to the East of East and fight the wild [[Were-worms]] in the [[Last Desert]]."<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

The Wainriders, as well as the Balchoth, were known for traveling in great camps of wagons which they fortified.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Given the eastern origins of the group, this bears many similarities to the [[Wikipedia:Orda (organization)|orda]] military structure employed by the [[Wikipedia:Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Wikipedia:Mongols|Mongol]] peoples.{{fact}}
