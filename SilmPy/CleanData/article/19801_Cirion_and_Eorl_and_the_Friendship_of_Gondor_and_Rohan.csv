'''''Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan''''' is a chapter in the book ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Synopsis==
The chapter explores the friendship between [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]]. [[Cirion]] worried about the [[Balchoth]] threat, sends [[Borondir|Borondir Udalraph]] to seek help from the [[Éothéod]]. Borondir meets [[Eorl]] and presents him the [[Red Arrow]]; their band eventually come to the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]].

We see then the oath of Cirion about the alliance of the two people over the [[Tomb of Elendil]], the gifting of [[Calenardhon]] to the Éothéod for their new home as [[Rohan]]. Then there is a discussion about the [[Tradition of Isildur]] concerning the Tomb of Elendil.

The text is part of another essay of Tolkien, "[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]" which was published in [[Vinyar Tengwar 42|''Vinyar Tengwar'', Number 42]].
