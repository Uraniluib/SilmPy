'''Tol-in-Gaurhoth''' or '''Isle of Werewolves''', also called '''Wizard's Isle'''<ref>{{LB|Leithian}}</ref> was a fortress held by [[Sauron]] in the [[First Age]], once called [[Tol Sirion]].

Tol-in-Gaurhoth began as the [[Minas Tirith in Beleriand|Minas Tirith]] of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], and was held by [[Orodreth]] for his uncle to guard the vale of [[Sirion]]. However, Orodreth was powerless to stop [[Sauron]] from taking the isle, and fled south. Sauron began breeding large [[wolves]] in the isle which he sent evil spirits in, turning them into [[werewolves]].

Ten years later during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]] on his quest for the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] enlisted Finrod's aid, but they were captured passing the isle when Sauron defeated Finrod in a spell contest. Their companions were slain one-by-one by werewolves. Finrod saved Beren's life, but died himself.

[[Lúthien]] and the Hound [[Huan]] came to Beren's rescue, and Huan killed the wolves sent against him. After [[Draugluin]] was killed Sauron went out in wolf-form but was defeated. Lúthien got control over the isle's magic from Sauron, who fled, and Minas Tirith was reduced to ruins. Finrod was buried there.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> The isle remained clean afterwards, but after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] it was retaken by Morgoth and its towers rebuilt.<ref>{{GA|Year 472}}</ref>
