== Cover/Jacket Text == 

''"In Arthedain the line of Isildur was maintained and endured, but the line soon perished in Cardolan and Rhudaur. There was often strife between the kingdoms, which hastened the waning of the Dúnedaiin. The chief matter of debate was the possession of the Weather Hills and the land westward towards Bree. Both Rhudaur and Cardolan desired to possess Amon Sûl (Weathertop), which stood on the borders of their realms..."'' - The Return of the King 

Arnor: The People recounts the noble yet tragic saga of the Dúnedain of the North - colonists and refugees from the lost isle of Númenor - who forged a realm in the wide lands of Eriador. The Númenóreans were not the only people to call Eriador home. Elves, Dwarves, and Men alike had wandered the ways of this region from time immemorial, and beings far more ancient than they still haunted its dark and forgotten corners. Yet Arnor was founded nonetheless and for centuries its kings secured peace and harmony for their many subjects. 

Arnor: The People describes the history, inhabitants, politics, society, warcraft, figures of note, and items of power that comprise Elendil's legacy. These penetrating windows onto the life of middle-Third Age Eriador combine to form an unmatched setting for adventure in the embattled North-kingdom of the Dúnedain and its successor states of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. 

Arnor: The People is a reprint of the first half of ICE's highly acclaimed Arnor Realm module, first published in 1994. This volume includes a thorough updating of all Elvish terms together with some revision deriving from Arnor's place in Middle-earth as a whole. Complete game statistics are presented for MERP, Rolemaster, and the Lord of the Rings Adventure Game.
