'''Elrond''' (b. {{FA|532}}) was the half-elven son of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], the father of [[Arwen]], and the Lord of [[Rivendell]] who consistently fought against [[Sauron]] throughout the Second and Third Ages.

Having been born in [[Beleriand]] towards the end of the [[First Age]], Elrond ever opposed [[Sauron]] and strove against him throughout the [[Second Age]] helping to bring about Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] as [[Gil-galad]]'s herald.

Elrond inherited Gil-galad's Elven ring [[Vilya]], and during the [[Third Age]] he fought against the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and, as a member of the [[White Council]], expelled the Necromancer from [[Dol Guldur]] (who was Sauron in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Age, he was the foster-father to [[Aragorn]] as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aragorn went on to marry Elrond's daughter Arwen.

After the destruction of [[the One Ring]], Elrond sailed west with [[Gandalf]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]; their passing marked the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]].

Elrond is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s legendarium, appearing in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He was critical to providing [[Thorin and Company]] the information they needed to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]], and his [[Council of Elrond]] brought about the creation of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the One Ring, and the ultimate and final defeat of Sauron.

==Appearance and traits==
{{Quote|He was as noble and fair as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref name="H3">{{H|3}}</ref>}}
Elrond is described to seem ageless, resembling neither old nor young, however one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.

Elrond is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.<ref name="FRMeetings">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref><ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>

==History==
===First Age===
Elrond was born at the [[Havens of Sirion]] late in the [[First Age]]. His parents were [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] and had a twin brother, [[Elros]], who later became the first king of [[Númenor]].
[[File:Tuuliky - Little Half-elf.jpg|thumb|left|Maglor raises Elrond]]
When the [[Sons of Fëanor]] [[Third Kinslaying|attacked the Havens of Sirion]], Elwing was taken by [[Ulmo]]. The twins were carried off, but later found near a waterfall and they were named as such; Elrond was discovered in a cave. Taken captive by Maglor, they were subsequently raised by him.  

Following the [[War of Wrath]], because of his Half-elven heritage the [[Valar]] gave Elrond and his brother a choice whether to be counted among the kindred of Elves or of Men.  Elrond chose to belong to the [[Firstborn]], while Elros chose to become mortal. It was Elros who voyaged over sea to Númenor following the star of Eärendil; whereas Elrond remained among the Elves and carried on the lineage of King Elwë.<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref> Elrond subsequently remained in [[Lindon]] with [[Gil-galad]], where he became known as a healer and lore-master.

===Second Age===
A fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], emmissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance to Lindon during the Second Age. Elrond and Gil-galad sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him.  They were correct, as proven in the later [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. Elrond led Elves from [[Lindon]] in [[Sack of Eregion|battle to defend Eregion]]. With them, and other Elves who fled the destruction of [[Eregion]], he established Imladris in {{SA|1697}}.<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

Many more refugees joined Elrond's host as Sauron ravaged Eriador during the course of the war. By {{SA|1700}}, Imladris, despite being [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]], was the only part of [[Eriador]] not under Sauron's control.  It was liberated by [[Gil-galad]]'s and [[Tar-Minastir]]'s forces. After Sauron's defeat, a Council was held at that time, establishing Elrond as Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador and that Imladris should be maintained as an Elvish stronghold.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Elves in the Last Alliance.jpeg|thumb|Elrond next to Gil-galad in battle.]]
Elrond marched with Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], serving as Gil-galad’s herald.  He was present during the [[Battle of Dagorlad|last battle]] of that war, witnessing the deaths of Gil-galad and Elendil.  When [[Isildur]] cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand at the conclusion of the battle, he and [[Círdan]] advised Isildur to destroy the Ring, but Isildur refused their counsel.  Elrond subsequently returned to Rivendell, which prospered the coming years with the aid of the Ring of Air, [[Vilya]], that Elrond had received from Gil-galad.  

It has been argued that following Gil-galad’s death, Elrond had the right to become High King of the Noldor, but he never claimed the title.  Indeed, after the Second Age ended, there were very few Noldor left in Middle-earth for there to be a king over them.

===Third Age===
Following Isildur's death, Elrond received the shards of [[Narsil]], which he preserved for many years.  He began his long tradition of fostering the heirs of Isildur by helping to raise Isildur's son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had been left in Rivendell during the War of the Last Alliance. 

In {{TA|109}}, Elrond married [[Celebrían]], the daughter of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]. Their first children, the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], were born in {{TA|130|n}}, and their daughter [[Arwen]] in {{TA|241|n}}. 

During the late reign of [[Arveleg I]], [[Second Siege of Imladris |Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]].  After an incursion by [[Angmar]] into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elvenfolk of Rivendell joined those of Lindon in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref>

Centuries later, when the Northern Kingdom fell, Elrond took the other heirlooms of Arnor (the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]) into his keeping, holding them for the one who would eventually be able to reclaim the throne of [[Arnor]].

Elrond along with others of the [[Wise]] were joined by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] who was sent by the Valar from the West. As they decided, Gandalf invaded [[Dol Guldur]]. The Necromancer withdrew and the [[Watchful Peace]] begun. In {{TA|2463}} the Wise formed the [[White Council]] with the Wizard [[Saruman]] as its head.
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|Angus McBride - ''Dol Guldur'']]
Elrond was separated from his wife when she was taken by [[Orcs]]; their sons rescued her but Elrond was unable to heal her mentally. She decided to leave for the [[Uttermost West|West]] in {{TA|2510|n}}.

In {{TA|2851}} the White Council met to decide on whether to act on Gandalf's discovery of the identity of the [[Necromancer]] as Sauron, but [[Saruman]] dissuaded the others from acting upon Gandalf's revelation.

In {{TA|2933}}, Elrond took [[Aragorn]] as his foster-son in Rivendell, and had Arwen live in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandmother.

Elrond named Aragorn ''[[Estel]]'' ("Hope") and concealed his heritage from him until he came of age. When Aragorn became an adult, Elrond gave him the [[Ring of Barahir]] and the shards of Narsil, foreseeing that Aragorn might be the one to claim the thrones of Gondor and Arnor.  When Aragorn fell in love with Arwen, Elrond revealed to him that Arwen shared the choice of the Half-elven, and that one or the other of them would ultimately be parted from her forever.  Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both Gondor and Arnor.
[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Elrond and Thrór's Map.jpg|thumb|Elrond examines [[Thrór's Map]].]]
In {{TA|2941}} Elrond welcomed [[Thorin and Company]] into his home, the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]] before the wild, in [[Rivendell]]. On Midsummer Eve - the night before the [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and [[Gandalf]] continued on their journey eastward - Elrond examined the swords which they had found in the trolls' cave. He read the runes and revealed that [[Thorin|Thorin's]] sword was called [[Orcrist]], the "Goblin-cleaver", and that Gandalf's sword was named [[Glamdring]], the "Foe-hammer". He told them that they were [[Elves|Elven]] swords from the ancient city of [[Gondolin]], long ago destroyed. He then looked at [[Thrór's Map]] and found that there were [[moon-letters]]. From the moon of that midsummer eve he could read the words, 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast'; and 'stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole'. This information proved vital for Bilbo and the Dwarves to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]] through its secret entrance.<ref name="H3"/>

During that same year, the [[White Council]] assailed [[Dol Guldur]] and rid [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence.<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> Upon Bilbo and Gandalf's return to Rivendell, Elrond and the grey wizard discussed this and the events of the Lonely Mountain. They both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name="H19">{{H|19}}</ref>

The White Council last met in {{TA|2953}}, when Gandalf expressed his concerns that the One Ring was Bilbo's ring found in the [[Goblin-town]]. Saruman quieted him, insisting that the Ring has been swept out to sea.

====The War of the Ring====
When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] first left the Shire with the One Ring, it was always his intention to go to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond.  Indeed, in his letter left at Bree, Gandalf counselled him to do so.  Elrond healed Frodo of his wound sustained at [[Weathertop]].  Elrond then hosted the feast that was held when Frodo recovered.
[[File:Michael Kaluta - Elrond Recalls the Host of Gilgalad.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Kaluta]] - ''Elrond Recalls the Host of Gil-galad'']]
Elrond presided at the [[Council of Elrond]]. During that meeting, he narrated what he knew of the history of Isildur and the Ring.  He identified Aragorn as the [[Heir of Isildur]], and when Frodo ultimately volunteered to carry the Ring, Elrond affirmed that decision as correct.  Elrond also appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], accepting [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] only reluctantly.

Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir to join the [[Dúnedain]] Rangers who rode to Rohan to join Aragorn.  Through Elrohir, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the [[Paths of the Dead]].  During the [[Last Debate]], Elrohir supported Aragorn’s decision to attack Mordor as a diversion to allow Frodo time to reach Mount Doom, saying that this was Elrond’s advice.  Following the [[War of the Ring]], Elrond escorted Arwen to Minas Tirith for her marriage to Aragorn, and parted from her in great sorrow.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Departure at the Grey Havens'']]
Elrond was one of the Elves who took the [[White Ship]] to [[Valinor]] along with Frodo, Gandalf, and the other [[Ring-bearers]].  The Third Age's end is marked by Elrond’s departure.

==Inspiration==
Elrond was created for ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  Subsequently he became the only character to appear in all three of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

In the chapter ''[[A Short Rest]]'' of ''The Hobbit'', it is said of Elrond that he “was an elf-friend — one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North.  In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.  He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer.” Note that in this description he is not identified as an elf himself, as Tolkien had not at this stage decided that Elrond of Rivendell was the same person as Elrond the son of Eärendil.

==Etymology==
The name '''Elrond''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈelrond]}}) has been translated as "Star-dome",<ref name="SoF">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', "[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]"</ref> and "Vault of Heaven"<ref name="Etym">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', "[[The Etymologies]]", page 384</ref> recalling the glory of [[Menegroth]] though at an earlier stage, it was supposed to mean "Elf of the Cave". His Quenya name was most likely '''Elerondo'''<ref>[[Petri Tikka]], "[http://www.geocities.com/petristikka/elvish/PE17.html Quenya words in Parma Eldalambaron 17]"</ref>, isolated from the patronymic ''Elerondiel'', "[[Arwen|daughter of Elrond]]".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Gilson]] (ed.), "Words, Phrases and Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings''", published in [[Parma Eldalamberon]] 17 (June 2007), page 56</ref>

==Genealogy==
Though he is known as '[[Half-elven]]', Elrond's lineage is much more complicated than that title suggests. He could claim descent from all the main branches of the [[Eldar]], each of the [[Three Houses of the Edain]], and even from the [[Maiar]]. To be completely correct, he was slightly more than ''half''-elven: actually nine-sixteenths of his ancestors were [[Elves]]. A full breakdown of his descent works out like this:
* Three eighths [[Edain]], through two lines: his grandfather [[Tuor]] of the [[House of Hador]], and his great-grandfather [[Beren]] of the [[House of Bëor]]. He was also descended from the third House of the Edain, the [[Haladin]], through [[Tuor|Tuor's]] grandmother [[Hareth]].
*Five sixteenths [[Sindar]], again through two lines: his grandmother [[Nimloth]] and his great-great-grandfather [[Thingol]].
*Five thirty-seconds [[Vanyar]], through his great-grandmother [[Elenwë]], and also through his great-great-great-grandmother, [[Indis]] the second wife of [[Finwë]].
*Three thirty-seconds [[Noldor]], through his great-grandfather, [[Turgon]] (who himself had only three-quarters Noldorin blood).
*One sixteenth [[Maiar]], through his great-great-grandmother [[Melian]].

===Films===
'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears in [[Rivendell]], crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]], and identifies [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although Tolkien clearly states [[Elves]] do not have beards. His voice was provided by [[Cyril Ritchard]].

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Elrond, voiced by [[André Morell]], appears at the [[Council of Elrond]]. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until [[the One Ring]] is brought forward does he take an active part.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears roughly the same as in the first of [[Rankin/Bass]]' films. The premise of the film, a [[minstrel of Gondor]] who tells the tale of "Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom" at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' 129th birthday party in Rivendell, allows Elrond to be a member of the audience. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on ''The Hobbit'', Rankin/Bass regular [[Paul Frees]] took over as his voice.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Elrond, played by [[Hugo Weaving]], first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of [[Gil-galad]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking [[Isildur]] into [[Mount Doom]], trying to persuade him to destroy the Ring. [[Círdan]] is omitted. 

:As in the book, Elrond heals [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s wound from [[Weathertop]]. Elrond then has a conversation with [[Gandalf]], discussing the many challenges that face them.  Elrond argues that the Ring cannot remain in Rivendell (in the film, Frodo appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Ring there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of [[Men]], and gives the first hints about [[Aragorn]]'s real identity. In the Council of Elrond, Elrond himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Ring. He does not select the Fellowship, but accepts those who volunteer.

:Elrond gains two additional scenes in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aragorn beside the grave of Aragorn’s mother. Elrond encourages the reluctant Aragorn to accept his fate of becoming [[Kings of Gondor|king]]. In the next scene, Elrond blesses the departing [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]].

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Though he had no scenes in the book, Elrond appears mainly in conversations with [[Arwen]], whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aragorn remembers Elrond telling him to abandon his love for Arwen, allowing her to sail to [[Valinor]]. Aragorn attempts to do this, but Arwen denies him. In another scene, Elrond persuades Arwen that she should sail to Valinor, describing what will happen if she remains and Aragorn dies. Elrond then has a telepathic communication with [[Galadriel]] discussing the [[War of the Ring|war]] that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to [[Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim|Men]] there, since when [[Haldir]] arrives at Helm's Deep he says that he brings "word from Elrond of Rivendell."

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:In the final installment of Jackson's film series, Elrond's first scene is with Arwen, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Elrond acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the [[shards of Narsil]] [[Andúril|re-forged]], then carries the new sword to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]]. He finally convinces Aragorn to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Later, Elrond escorts Arwen to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Aragorn|Aragorn's]] coronation, and he finally sails to Valinor with the [[Ring-bearers]].

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Elrond.<ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> As in the book, he identifies Gandalf's and [[Thorin]]'s respective swords, as well as translating the [[Moon-letters|runes]] on Thorin's [[Thrór's Map|map]] in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first]] film. There is an additional scene where Elrond meets with the [[White Council]]. Like [[Saruman]], Elrond is somewhat skeptical of Gandalf's claims, deeming the Quest of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] unwise. However, he is clearly alarmed by Gandalf's revealing of the [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] from [[Dol Guldur]]. Elrond is seen again in the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|third]] of these films where he participates in the [[Attack on Dol Guldur|battle]] of Dol Guldur, joining Saruman in fighting off the [[Nazgûl]].

===Radio series===
'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:The part of Elrond is voiced by [[Garard Green]].<ref name="RT1674">Radio Times, Volume 129, No. 1674, [[9 December|December 9]], [[1955]]</ref>

'''1968: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''
:In this adaptation, Elrond is voiced by [[John Pullen]]. Gandalf claims that he is not an Elf, but an Elf-friend.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Hugh Dickson]] provided the voice of Elrond in this radio series. He first appears in the episode containing the [[Council of Elrond]], and appears unintroduced. Dickson showcases great trouble with pronouncing Elvish, and especially diphthongs. Gimli is the son of "[[Glóin|Gloo-in]]", who fought the dragon "[[Smaug|Sma-oog]]". Legolas is the son of "[[Thranduil|Thrandoo-uhl]]".  He reappears in the final 2 episodes - first in the return to Rivendell warning Frodo to look out for Bilbo in the Shire one Autumn soon, and finally with Galadriel and Bilbo in the Shire before they all ride to the Grey Havens.

===Games===
'''1982: [[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|''The Hobbit (1982 text adventure game)'']]'''

:Elrond appears at Rivendell. The player can give him the curious map to read, and he also provides the player with lunch.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Like his predecessor Hugh Dickson, [[Jim Piddock]] shows incredible difficulty with diphthongs. "Glau-win" and "Thrandool" dislike each other, so too their sons. 

'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:In a short cutscene between the levels "Roast Mutton" and "Over Hill and Under Hill", Elrond is briefly mentioned. An artful image on a manuscript can be seen, while the [[Tom Kane|narrator]] explains Elrond examined the map and the swords. 

'''2006: ''[[EA's The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:In an alternative, northern War of the Ring, Rivendell is the main base of operations for Glóin and Glorfindel. As such, Elrond is the source of missions and advice, and serves as the narrator throughout the game (Hugo Weaving reprises the role). Elrond is a playable character during the assault on [[Dol Guldur]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Elrond is a non-playable character and can be found in the library of the Last Homely House in Rivendell. During the Elven Prologue set hundreds of years before the War of the Ring he participates in a battle in the refuge of Edhellion, in northern [[Ered Luin]].

:Early in the game Elrond sends his sons, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], to scout [[Fornost]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> He later interacts with main characters in Rivendell, guiding them on their path of defeating Argandaur.
