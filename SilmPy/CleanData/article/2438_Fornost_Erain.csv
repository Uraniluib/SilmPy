{{quote|Deadmen's Dike, you say. So it has been called for long years; but its right name, [[Barliman Butterbur|Barliman]], is '''Fornost Erain''', Norbury of the Kings.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name="Bound">{{RK|VI7}}</ref>}}

'''Fornost Erain''' was the capital of [[Arnor]] and later [[Arthedain]]. It was located at the south end of the North Downs, about 100 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles north of [[Bree]], at the northern terminus of the [[North-South Road]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
Fornost most probably was founded, around or after the establishment of the realm of [[Arnor]] in {{SA|3320}}<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> since there is no record of the Númenóreans penetrating so far north before the Downfall of Númenor. After the fall of [[Sauron]], and early in the [[Third Age]], the Army of Arnor marched west through the [[Fords of Isen]] and continued north to Fornost.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

In {{TA|861}}, when King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] died, Arnor was divided into three kingdoms.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Fornost would become the capital of the new realm of [[Arthedain]] at some point; the throne may have lingered for some time in the original capital, [[Annuminas]], after the division, if it wasn't moved immediately to Fornost. In {{TA|1409|n}}, when the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] took the tower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], the ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' was saved and carried back to Fornost. The new and young King [[Araphor]] repelled the enemy from Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

===Fall===
:''Main article: [[Fall of Fornost]]
In {{TA|1974}}, Arthedain was overrun by the forces of [[Angmar]]. Fornost was captured, and King [[Arvedui]] fled into the northern wastes and was lost in the [[Icebay of Forochel]] with the two palantirs he had saved from the forces of [[Angmar]]. In the following year, a fleet of ships from [[Gondor]], led by [[Eärnur]], landed at [[Mithlond]]. The Elves of [[Lindon]], led by [[Círdan]], joined the forces of [[Gondor]], the remaining [[Dúnedain of the North]] came, and so did a few archers from the Shire. Eärnur fought the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in the plains west of Fornost and defeated the armies of Angmar, but the Witch-king himself escaped.<ref name="Eriador"/>

===Deadmen's Dike===
After Fornost Erain was abandoned, the inhabitants of the nearest settlement, [[Bree]], referred to it as '''Deadmen's Dike''', and did not come there. Only [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] came there from time to time, but no-one knew what they did there.<ref>{{FR|I10}}</ref>

After [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] reunited [[Reunited Kingdom|the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor]], he had the ruins rebuilt and made a great city where Men dwelt once again.<ref name="Bound"/>

==Etymology==
Fornost Erain is [[Sindarin]]. It means "Northern Fortress (of the) Kings"; from ''forn'' "north" and ''[[ost]]'' "fortress", and ''erain'' is the plural of ''[[aran]]''. The ''Fornost'' component is a direct cognate to [[Quenya]] ''[[Formenos]]''.

It was translated as "Norbury of the Kings" (from supposedly [[Old English]] ''norð-burg''<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 774 (entry ''Norbury'')</ref>), which represents its [[Westron]] name.
