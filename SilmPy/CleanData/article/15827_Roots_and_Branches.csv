'''''Roots and Branches: Selected Papers on Tolkien''''' is the eleventh book of Walking Tree's ''[[Cormarë Series]]''. Unlike most other volumes, it is not a collection of essays, but all work by [[Tom Shippey]]. 

== From the publisher ==
{{blockquote|Professor [[Tom Shippey]] is best known for his books ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century]]''. Yet they are not the only contributions of his to Tolkien studies. Over the years, he has written and lectured widely on Tolkien-related topics. Unfortunately, many of his essays, though still topical, are no longer available. The current volume unites for the first time a selection of his older essays together with some new, as yet unpublished articles.}}
