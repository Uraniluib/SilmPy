'''Hazad Longbeard''' was a [[Men|man]] living in [[Agar]] during the [[Second Age]]<ref group=note>The exact timeframe of Hazad's and Tar-Elmar's life is not given, but since the [[Númenóreans]] are seen as hostiles in the story, it's possible that it refers to a time after the [[Shadow]] fell over the Island, when they started to dominate the natives of [[Middle-earth]]; this points to a date around {{SA|1800}}. See {{App|SA}}</ref>, the son of [[Buldar]] and [[Elmar]], a woman of the "Fell Folk of the East" who had been taken prisoner by his father, and later wedded. 

Hazad married late, due to the admiration he had for his late mother, Elmar. He fathered many children, including [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]], which was his seventeenth child.  

Along with his youngest son, he delivered the ill message to [[Mogru]] of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ships approaching the land of Agar.

Though he found pride in the number of his descendants, his greatest joy was his beard, long over five feet and, unlike his sons, ruly and close to him all the time. He was described as "short, though, harsh-tongued, heavy-handed and quick to violence". <ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Some analysts have noticed the similarity of ''Hazad'' with [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]] ''[[Khazâd]]'', "Dwarves", and [[Adûnaic]] ''[[hazad]]'', "seven". The name would then either mean "Dwarf (bearded, smaller one)" or "Seventh child", however, this remains speculation.<ref>[[Andreas Möhn|Andreas Moehn]], ''[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html Etymologies of the Atani languages]''</ref>

In a penciled note [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] proposed that Buldar should be left out of the tale and Elmar be Hazad's wife.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}, note 5</ref>
