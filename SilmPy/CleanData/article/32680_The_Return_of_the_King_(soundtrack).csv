'''The Return of the King''' is the seventeenth track of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' by [[Howard Shore]].   The 10 minute and 14 second work covers much of the "many endings" of the movie except for the Grey Havens.  Featured are the talents of Sir James Galway and Renée Flemming.  For the section of Aragorn’s Coronation, [[Viggo Mortensen]] provided the melody for the words of J.R.R. Tolkien:

Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.  In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.
</poem>

:In [[Quenya]] (sung by Viggo Mortensen):

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
