'''Kortirion''' was a city in [[Valinor]] on a hill and a tall grey tower.

When the [[Elves]] came to [[Tol Eressea]], they built the town of Koromas in [[Alalminórë]]. [[Ingil]] the son of [[Inwe]] built a tall grey tower on [[Kôr]]. Because Koromas resembled their ancient dwelling with the tower, it was also named Kortirion.<ref name=LTI16>{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref>

Kortirion was associated with [[Hengest]] and came to be known in the tongue of the English as [[Wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]].<ref name=lt6>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>

In the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', the Valinorean city became [[Tirion]] upon [[Túna]].

==Etymology==
In the etymology of Tolkien's earliest languages, the name of the hill of [[Kôr]] refers to its roundness. It is derived from [[Primitive Elvish]] name ''Guord'' from which came [[Qenya]] ''Qora'' and [[Gnomish]] ''Gwar''. The Gnomish name of Kortirion was ''Mindon-Gwar''. Both Qenya and Gnomish names mean "Tower of Kôr".<ref name=lt6/>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that his father intended to relate the Gnomish form ''gwar-'' with the first element of ''War''wick ([[Welsh]]: Caer''gwar''), suggesting it to be Elvish in origin.<ref name=lt6/>

==Other names==
The city was also called Koromas, meaning "the Resting of the Exiles of [[Kôr]]".<ref name=LTI16/>
