'''Pipe-weed''' (also known as Halflings' Leaf or simply Leaf) was a plant developed by the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]]. 
==History==
Apparently the plant grew in [[Númenor]] and was brought to [[Middle-earth]] by [[Númenóreans]] during the [[Second Age]]. In [[Gondor]] it grew as a wild herb, appreciated primarily for its fragrant blossoms and the [[Gondorians]] knew it as '''''sweet galenas''''' or more popularly as '''''westmansweed''''',<ref name="healing">{{RK|V8}}</ref> a reference to its origin.

It was not until the [[Third Age]] when it reached [[Eriador]], probably through the [[Greenway]], and the [[Bree-hobbits]] were the first to use it for [[smoking]]. From [[Bree]] the habit of smoking pipe-weed spread to other regions, as well as to other races, such as [[Men]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Wizards]].<ref name="pipeweed">{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> 

But it was in [[the Shire]] where it was first domesticated, by [[Tobold Hornblower]] of [[Longbottom]] in [[Southfarthing]] around {{SR|1070}}. The cultivation and exportation of this herb became a key industry in the Shire, especially in the south. Popular varieties of pipe-weed included [[Longbottom Leaf]], [[Old Toby]], and [[Southern Star]] from the Shire.<ref name="pipeweed"/> Perhaps less popular was [[Southlinch]] from Bree.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>

The [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] learned to smoke pipe-weed from the Hobbits and was often seen blowing smoke-rings.<ref name="pipeweed"/> [[Saruman]] initially derided him for this, but at some point he took up smoking himself, and even had commerce with the Shire: After the destruction of [[Isengard]], pipe-weed was found among its stores, but the Hobbits [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] failed to realize the [[Sharkey|sinister implications]].

After the [[War of the Ring]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] authored ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'' discussing the origins and history of the Hobbits' 'art' of [[smoking]] Pipe-weed.<ref name="pipeweed"/>

==Inspiration==
In the prologue to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien stated specifically that "it is a strain of the herb ''nicotiana''",<ref name="pipeweed"/> i.e. tobacco. Whether the substance is psychoactive remains unclear.

==Etymology==

The common Gondorian name of pipe-weed was '''Westmansweed'''.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref> The more noble name was '''''galenas''''' (a [[Gondor Sindarin]] form of the proper [[Sindarin]] form ''galanes''), with [[Quenya]] forms ''alanesse'' or ''alenesse'' derived from [[GALA|ala-]] "plant, grow" and ''nes-'' "sweet smelling".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 100</ref>
