{{quote| ''Mithril!'' All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of ''mithril'' did not tarnish or grow dim.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name="Journey">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>}}
'''''Mithril''''' was a precious silvery metal, stronger than steel but much lighter in weight, which was mined by the [[Dwarves]] in the mines of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and could be beaten and polished without being weakened or tarnished. ''Mithril'', also known as silver-steel and Moria-silver, was admired and treasured by all the [[Portal:Characters|races]]. The [[Men]] called it "true-silver"  while the [[Dwarves]], who loved it above all things, had their own, secret name for it.

Mithril was rare and was found in [[Númenor]] and perhaps also in [[Aman]]. 

==History==
The sole mithril-vein of the [[Misty Mountains]] made the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] wealthy. The [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] settled [[Eregion]] because of it and created objects of mithril, thanks to trade with the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves of Moria]]; one of the [[Three Rings]] [[Rings of Power|of Power]], [[Nenya]], was made of mithril. The [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]] made an alloy out of it called ''[[ithildin]]'' ("star moon"), which was used to decorate gateways and portals. It is visible only by starlight or moonlight. The [[Doors of Durin]] bore inlaid ''ithildin'' designs. 

The [[Star of Elendil]] was a gem set on mithril fillet that was a heirloom of the [[Lords of Andúnië]] of Númenor.<ref name="Gladden">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>  

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the only source of mithril was Moria. In [[Gondor]], the [[Guards of the Citadel]] of [[Minas Tirith]] wore helmets of ''mithril''. The smiths of [[Rivendell]] also created a second "Star of Elendil" of mithril, after the first one was lost with [[Isildur]].<ref name="Gladden"/>

Even before Moria was abandoned by the Dwarves ''mithril'' was worth ten times its own weight in [[gold]]. 

The mithril-vein reached [[Barazinbar]]<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>, where the Dwarves mined and by {{TA|1980}} they released the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] from the [[Elder Days]] which destroyed the Dwarven Kingdom. Middle-earth's only source of new ''mithril'' ore was cut off. Production of new mithril ore stopped entirely, and it became priceless.  The only ''mithril''-objects at the end of the Age were only heirlooms, or new items forged out of existing ones. The mithril helmets worn by the [[Guards of the Citadel]] were considered "heirlooms from the glory of old days".

During the [[War of the Ring]] [[Arwen]] prepared for [[Aragorn]] a banner with the [[Livery of Elendil]] in mithril, gems, and gold. Aragorn used this during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to herald the Return of the King.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

After [[Gimli]] became lord of [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]], he and his Dwarves forged great gates of ''mithril'' to replace the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]] of [[Minas Tirith]] which were broken by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]].

=== The Mithril Coat ===

Of all items made of ''mithril'', the most famous is the "small shirt of mail" retrieved from the hoard of the dragon [[Smaug]], and given to [[Bilbo Baggins]] by [[Thorin]].  

A kingly gift, the ''mithril''-coat was actually worth more than the entire worth of the Shire (Bilbo probably knew this, but he didn't care).  Bilbo had it decorated on a stand in [[Bag End]] until he donated it to [[Mathom-house]]<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> but he took it back before leaving the [[Shire]] for [[Rivendell]]. Years later, he gave it to his nephew [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who wore it during the Quest to [[Mount Doom]].  It saved Frodo's life when he was nearly skewered by an [[Orcs|Orc]] in the Mines of Moria. It was later taken by the Orcs who captured him in the pass above [[Cirith Ungol]], and passed on to the Dark Lord's servants at [[Barad-dûr]].  When the coat was displayed before the hosts of [[Aragorn]] at the Gates of Mordor, many despaired, thinking Frodo had been captured or killed, and the Ring taken.  Gandalf reclaimed it from Sauron's lieutenant, and was later able to return it to Frodo after the battles were won. After the [[Battle of Bywater]], the coat once again saved Frodo's life after [[Saruman]] attempted to assasinate him at [[Bag End]]<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>.

==Etymology==

The name ''mithril'' consists of the two [[Sindarin]] words ''[[mith]]'' ("grey, light grey") + ''[[ril]]'' ("brilliance").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>

== Inspiration ==
In the ''[[wikipedia:Hervarar Saga|Hervarar saga]]'', which was a cycle dealing with the magic sword ''Tyrfing'' (and from which Tolkien borrowed, for instance, the names [[Dwalin]] and [[Durin]]), the hero Orvar-Odd wore a ''silken mailcoat'' which nothing could pierce (''Oddr svarar: "ek vil berjask við Angantýr, hann mun gefa stór högg með Tyrfingi, en ek trúi betr skyrtu minni, enn brynju þinni, til hlífðar"'').

For the literal-minded reader, it can be unclear whether or not ''mithril'' is a real metal.  Candidates for a possible real-world equivilent of ''mithril'' have been diverse, but the one metal that has by far the greatest similarities with described ''mithril'', is '''titanium'''.  Titanium has half the density and weight of steel, has a lustrous silver-white color, is one of the strongest of metals, and is chemically inert such that it does not corrode over time.  Like ''mithril'', titanium was also exceptionally rare and precious, as it does not typically occur as a workable metallic form in nature&mdash;the ore is actually extremely abundant, but the practical technology to extract titanium metal from the ore has only been widely available and economical since the 20th century.  Titanium also has remarkable strengthening effects on other metals when alloyed with them.<ref>[http://www.thetolkienforum.com/showthread.php?13037-Mithril-and-Orichalcum&p=426876#post426876 Re: Mithril and Orichalcum], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium Titanium on Wikipedia]</ref>  Other metals have been proposed as candidates for ''mithril'':
* Platinum is silver-white in appearance and extremely resistant to corrosion, but is simply far too heavy to be ''mithril''.
* Aluminium and magnesium have been a candidates for similar reasons as titanium, and aluminium is indeed the single most abundant metallic element in the earth's crust.  These metals are also far too chemically reactive to naturally exist as a workable metal, which originally made them as precious and scarce as ''mithril''.  (Famously, Napoleon III of France once bought dinnerware made out of aluminium because it was more expensive than gold at the time.)  But they are also less lustrous and not as strong as titanium, though they are each also lighter than titanium.
Certainly Tolkien, being highly educated, would have had knowledge of these metals and the difficulty in preparing them.  In Tolkien's universe, ''mithril'' metal also does not typically exist anywhere except in specific localized deposits, with the only known deposits in [[Middle-earth]] being found in the mines of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].  If ''mithril'' was indeed titanium and titanium does not tend to occur naturally as a metal, then ''mithril'' deposits may have possibly been a result of [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s original formation of the [[Misty Mountains]], with the ''mithril'' either being intentionally refined as a workable metallic form when the mountains were risen, or being coincidentally formed as a chemical by-product of when Melkor so quickly formed the mountain chain to fend off the [[Valar]].  However, probably because nobody is known to have asked Tolkien about "''mithril''", it will never be known with an absolute certainty whether ''mithril'' is based on any real metal.
