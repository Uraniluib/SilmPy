}}'''Brytta Léofa''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2752|n}} – {{TA|2842|n}}, aged 90 years) was the eleventh [[King of Rohan]]. 

==History==

Brytta was the son of [[Fréaláf|Fréaláf Hildeson]], and became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2798}}.

During his reign Rohan was still recovering from the war with the [[Dunlendings]], and hostilities remained at the western borders. Brytta continued his father's habits of helping those in need, earning him the name "Léofa".

Asides from the troubles with the Dunlendings his rule saw a new trouble, as the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|final battle]] of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] caused great numbers of [[Orcs]] to flee from the [[Misty Mountains]], trying to make a home in the [[White Mountains]] south of Rohan. Brytta fought them off, and when he died it was believed Rohan was free of those intruders.

He ruled for 44 years, and was succeeded by his son [[Walda]] at his death in 2842.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Brytta means "distributor" in [[Old English]], having sometimes the meaning "prince". His nickname Léofa means "beloved".
