'''Marhwini''' was a [[Northmen|Northman]] and a member of the noble family of the [[Rhovanion|Kingdom of Rhovanion]]. His father [[Marhari]] was a descendant of King [[Vidugavia]] of Rhovanion.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 5</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|1851}}, Rhovanion was invaded by a tribe of [[Easterlings]] known as the [[Wainriders]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  The soldiers of the Kingdom of Rhovanion, together with the armies of [[Gondor]], met the Wainriders at the [[Battle of the Plains]] in {{TA|1856|n}}, which was a disaster. The [[King of Gondor]], [[Narmacil II]], was killed and Marhwini's father Marhari died leading the rearguard. Much of the Kingdom of Rhovanion was lost and its people were enslaved. Some Northmen escaped, and Marhwini led one band of refugees to the west.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

The refugees wandered until they reached the untamed land between the eastern bank of the [[Anduin|River Anduin]] and the western edge of [[Mirkwood|Mirkwood Forest]]. Settling there in the [[Vales of Anduin]], the refugees would become the [[Éothéod]], the ancestors of the mighty [[Riders of Rohan]].<ref name="Cirion"/>

Forty-three years later, Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] that the Wainriders were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]] but the enslaved Northmen also prepared a revolt against the Wainriders. Calimehtar  provoked the Wainriders out of [[Ithilien]]; the Wainriders came down with all the strength that they could spare, and Calimehtar gave way before them, drawing them away from their homes.  At the peak of the battle, horsemen that Calimehtar had sent over the [[Undeeps]] (left unguarded by the enemy) joined with a great [[éored]] led by Marhwini and he drove the Wainriders back to the [[East]].<ref name="Cirion"/>

==Etymology==
Marhwini is [[Gothic]] for "horse-friend". The first element of the name is related to the English word "mare" (see ''[[mearas]]''). The second is an early form of [[Old English]] ''-wine'' meaning "friend" seen in several [[Rohirric]] names (eg. [[Folcwine]], [[Elfwine]]).<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 6</ref>
