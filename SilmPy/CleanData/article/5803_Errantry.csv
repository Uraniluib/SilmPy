'''''Errantry''''' is a [[Hobbit]] poem which was probably composed by [[Bilbo Baggins]], shortly after his return from the [[Lonely Mountain]] in {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and probably having heard Elvish tales of the [[First Age]]. The attribution to Bilbo is made because of its similarity to the ''[[Song of Eärendil]]'', believed to be a transformed and applied to the legend of [[Eärendil]] version of this poem.<ref name="Preface">{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

While it referred to original [[Elvish]] names, they were probably fictitious.

==Structure==
''Errantry'' was actually one of the cyclical nonsense poems which amused [[Hobbits]], although this one is the longest and most elaborate of the kind found in the [[Red Book]].<ref name="Preface"/>

The poem has complex trisyllabic assonances with an original metre invented by Bilbo, and was obviously proud of them. Such do not appear in other pieces in the Red Book.<ref name="Preface"/>

==Inspiration==
It is a three-page long poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], first published on [[9 November]] [[1933]] in ''The Oxford Magazine''. Tolkien himself considered it his most attractive poem. The meter is his own invention (using trisyllabic assonances or near-assonances) and never wrote another in this style.<ref>{{L|133}}</ref>

==Usage outside the legendarium==
This poem was set to music by [[Donald Swann]].  The sheet music and an audio recording are part of the song-cycle ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]''.<ref>{{RGEO|Errantry}}</ref>
