The '''White Tree of Gondor''' stood as a symbol of [[Gondor]] in the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] in [[Minas Tirith]]. Its predecessor was a seedling of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]] planted in [[Minas Ithil]], that was destroyed before the end of the [[Second Age]].

The White Tree also appears in the [[Livery of Elendil]], as a motif upon Gondor's flag.

== History ==

=== First White Tree ===
The first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that [[Isildur]], at great personal risk, managed to steal from [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]] the Fair, the White Tree of [[Númenor]], before that one was destroyed at [[Sauron]]'s insistence. He suffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.

This sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in [[Minas Ithil]] before his house. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack in {{SA|3429}} that captured Minas Ithil, and he burned the White Tree. Isildur escaped taking with him again a sapling.<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

=== Second White Tree ===
In the {{TA|2}}, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree in [[Minas Anor]] in memory of his brother, [[Anárion]].<ref name=rings/>

This White Tree lasted until {{TA|1636}}, when the [[Great Plague]] hit [[Gondor]], killing among many others King [[Telemnar]] and his children.

=== Third White Tree ===
{{seealso|Dead Tree}}
A third sapling was planted in {{TA|1640}} by King [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] and died in {{TA|2872}} with the death of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Ruling Steward]] [[Belecthor II]].<ref name=B2>{{App|B2}}</ref>

Since no seedling was found, it was left standing after its death.<ref name=B2/> When eventually replaced in {{TA|3019}}, it was placed in the [[Rath Dínen|Tombs of the Kings]] with royal honors.

=== Fourth White Tree ===
When [[Aragorn]] became king he discovered (with [[Gandalf]]'s help) a sapling of the White Tree on the high hallow upon the slopes of [[Mindolluin]], high above the city, which he reverently planted in its place. In June of {{TA|3019}} the sapling bloomed.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref><ref group=note>There is an inconsistency in dates: according to ''[[Appendix B]]'', Elessar found the sapling on [[June 25]]; however the chapter ''The Steward and the King'' states that "when the month of June entered in it was laden with blossom", suggesting here that Aragorn planted the sapling ''before'' June began.</ref>
