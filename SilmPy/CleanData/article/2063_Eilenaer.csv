'''Eilenaer''' was a tall hill or mountain with its feet shrouded by woodland, Eilenaer was in many ways similar to [[Eilenach]], which stood far to the east in the [[Drúadan Forest]], and indeed these two ancient names appear to be related in meaning. While Eilenach kept its old name, Eilenaer was renamed when it became the site of [[Elendil]]'s Tomb. In [[Gondor]] after that time it was known by the [[Elvish]] title [[Amon Anwar]], 'Hill of Awe'. When the [[Rohirrim]] came to settle in [[Rohan]], long afterwards, they gave it another name in their own tongue - ''Halifirien'', the 'Holy Mountain' on the borders of their realm.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, The Tradition of Isildur</ref>
