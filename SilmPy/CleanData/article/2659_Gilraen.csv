'''Gilraen the Fair''' ({{TA|2907}}-{{TA|3007|n}}) was a [[Dúnadan of the North]], the daughter of [[Dírhael]] and [[Ivorwen]], and a descendant of the first chieftain, [[Aranarth]].

==History==
She was born in the year {{TA|2907|n}} of the [[Third Age]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> She wanted to marry [[Arathorn II]], the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] but her father at first did not want her partly because she was at the time younger than customary for marriage, and he also foresaw that Arathorn would have a short life. However, Ivorwen persuaded him in the end, saying that Arathorn's short life was a further incentive to have a quick marriage, so that an heir could be born to be their people's leader. They were married in {{TA|2929}}.<ref name="Tale">{{App|Tale}}</ref> Gilraen's son [[Aragorn]] was born in {{TA|2931}}, but her husband was killed [[Third Age 2933|two years later]]<ref name="TA"/>, as her father predicted.

She then brought her son to live in [[Rivendell|Imladris]] to protect him from harm (from Isidur's enemies) as was customary with the [[Heir of Isildur]]. She opposed Aragorn's love for [[Arwen]], believing that Arwen's lineage was more noble than his and that [[Elves]] and [[mortality|mortals]] should not intermarry. In {{TA|2954}} Gilraen returned to her people in [[Eriador]] where she died in {{TA|3007|n}},<ref name="TA"/> aged one-hundred years. 

Her final words to Aragorn were the [[linnod]] ''Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim'', meaning "I gave [[Estel|Hope]] (an obvious reference to her son's nickname) to the Dúnedain, I have kept no hope for myself."<ref name="Tale"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Gilraen'' is [[Sindarin]]. It contains the frequent element ''[[gil]]'' "star" and ''raen'' "nettled, enlaced". The name means "one adorned with a tressure set with small gems in its network."<ref>{{VT|42}}, pp. 11-13</ref> as she wore a ceremonial headgarb with many jewels.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Aragorn and [[Elrond]] have a conversation at a memorial to Gilraen in [[Rivendell]]. Elrond suggests that she brought Aragorn to [[Rivendell|Imladris]] for safety from pursuit by the forces of evil. Elrond also thinks that Gilraen believed Aragorn would not escape his fate. Her memorial features a statue along with her name and an inscription of her final words written in [[Tengwar]].

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Elrond and Aragorn recite Gilraen's final words when Elrond brings the re-forged sword [[Andúril]] to Aragorn, with the words possibly taking on a different connotation from their meaning in the book.
