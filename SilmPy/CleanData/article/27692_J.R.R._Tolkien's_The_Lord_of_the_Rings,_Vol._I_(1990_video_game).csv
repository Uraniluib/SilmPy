A sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers]]'', was released in [[1993]]. Interplay also released a [[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (SNES)|version for the SNES]], which greatly differed from the PC game.

==Development==

Interplay started developing a fantasy RPG, which was not set in Middle-earth, in the late 1980s. After Interplay obtained the license for creating a video game based on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the game was scrapped and redeveloped as an adaptation of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name="Polygon"/>

== Gameplay ==

The player starts as [[Frodo Baggins]] and can obtain the rest of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] (except [[Boromir]]) as they progress through the main story. The player can switch between characters to decide who leads the Fellowship, equip other party members with a range of weapons and armour, distribute skills among the group, cast spells, and perform various skill-based actions.<ref name="Tolkien Games"/>  Whilst progressing through the main story, the player is able to complete several side-adventures and revisit previous locations, during which new characters, quests and objects can be discovered.<ref name="Polygon"/><ref name="Tolkien Games"/> The game also included a day/night system. At night, some enemies are stronger and there is a greater chance of encountering the [[Nazgûl]] than during day-time.<ref name="Tolkien Games"/>

The game opens with some cut scenes from [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. The player starts as [[Frodo Baggins]] in [[Hobbiton]] and must first travel to [[Buckland]] before crossing the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Barrow-downs]]. In the Barrow-downs the player must escape the [[Barrow-wights]] with the help of [[Tom Bombadil]] whilst at [[Rivendell]] you must collect the pieces of [[Andúril]], which can be found in the surrounding lands.<ref name="Tolkien Games"/>

After the player escapes the darkness of [[Moria]] they must search the gifts from [[Galadriel]]. When Frodo Baggins is captured in [[Dol Guldur]] the remaining members of the Fellowship must then free Frodo with help from [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] and the [[Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]] before the [[Witch-king]] arrives and brings the [[Ring-bearer]] to [[Mordor]] and the fate of [[Middle-earth]] is lost.<ref name="Tolkien Games"/>
