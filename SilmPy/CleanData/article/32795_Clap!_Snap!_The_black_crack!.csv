'''Clap! Snap! The black crack!''' is the song sung by the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|goblins]] as they descend into [[Goblin-town]] after capturing [[Thorin]], the dwarves, and [[Bilbo Baggins]] (but not [[Gandalf]]).  The goblins kept time by the flap of their flat feet upon the stone floor of the passage.  As they sang they brought out whips to force the dwarves and the hobbit to run as fast as they could.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>

The first stanza refers to the capture of Thorin's company in their "[[Front Porch]]", the seemingly small cave the company had taken shelter in while traversing the [[Misty Mountains|mountains]].  The second and third stanzas indicate that the captives will be turned into hard-working slaves of the goblins far within the mountains.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Clap! Snap! the black crack!
Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!
And down down to Goblin-town
    You go, my lad!

Clash, crash! Crush, smash!
Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs!
Pound, pound, far underground!
     Ho, ho! my lad!

Swish, smack! Whip crack!
Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat!
Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,
While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh,
Round and round far underground
     Below, my lad!
</poem>

Bones will be shattered, necks will be wrung!
You'll be beaten and battered, from racks you'll be hung!
You will die down here and never be found!
Down in the deep of Goblin-town!
</poem>
:In the Extended Edition, he is introduced singing a lengthier, novel-accurate version of the song with the rest of his subjects as the Dwarves arrive, just before he interrogates them. Once he finishes, he asks the Dwarves what they think of the song. [[Balin]] retorts that it isn't a song, but an "abomination".
