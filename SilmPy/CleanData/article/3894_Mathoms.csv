'''Mathoms''' was an old word of the [[Hobbitish|hobbit-dialect]], not recorded as being in use outside [[the Shire]]. It was used to refer to "trinkets" or any item that had no particular immediate use. 

Mathoms were many of the presents that passed from hand to hand by the [[Shire-hobbits]] - an important part of their culture - and whose owners did not wish to throw them away.

Eventually they were stored in the [[Mathom-house]] in [[Michel Delving]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>
