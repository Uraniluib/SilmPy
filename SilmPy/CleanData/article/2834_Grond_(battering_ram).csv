'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The ram took the shape of the whole wolf's body, rather of just its head. [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] called it in after a smaller battering ram proved futile against the great gates.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Grond was encountered in the Epic Quest "[[The Strength of Sauron]] Book 3: Chapter 8: Gothmog Appears". The player managed to slightly damage the great ram, delaying its use in the coming battle. [[Gothmog]]'s arrival forced the player to withdraw before further damage could be done.
