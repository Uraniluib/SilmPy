The '''Treegarth of Orthanc''' was the name of the forest established around the tower of [[Orthanc]] in the valley of [[Nan Curunír]].

==History==
Following the [[Ents|Entish]] victory at the [[Battle of Isengard]], many trees stayed around Orthanc to guard [[Saruman]].<ref name="RKPartings" /> Shortly before [[Gandalf]], [[Théoden]] and company departed [[Isengard]] on [[5 March]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Treebeard]] declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the "Watchwood".<ref>{{App|B3}}; {{TT|Voice}}</ref>

When Gandalf and company returned on [[22 August]] {{TA|3019}} Treebeard welcomed them to the "Treegarth of Orthanc". The Ents had destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]] and filled the land with orchards and trees. A stream ran into a clear lake, in the middle of which stood Orthanc the impregnable tower.<ref>{{App|B4}}</ref><ref name="RKPartings" /> However despite the "watch", Treebeard allowed Saruman to leave the Watchwood.<ref name="RKPartings" />

Within the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Ents complete self-governance of the Treegarth of Orthanc.<ref name="RKPartings" />
