==Transcript==

{{blockquote|My dear Rose,<br/><br/>I hear from your dear mother that you made your final profession, and I send you my congratulations (a weak word alas!), and best wishes: I should say my deep and respectful admiration, and sense of privilege in having known you and being still remembered by you. God bless you in all your days on earth – now so unhappy, though I think it has often (or usually) been quite as unhappy, if perhaps never in such great peril. Your mother has perhaps told you that my eldest son, [[John Tolkien|Fr John]], said a (Latin) mass for your dear father, and I served it. Spare me a prayer of your sweet charity: I have need.<br/><br/>Yours very sincerely<br/><br/>JRR Tolkien}}
