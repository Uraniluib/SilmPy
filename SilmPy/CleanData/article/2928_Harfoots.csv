'''Harfoots''' are one of the three breeds of [[Hobbits]]. The Harfoots were the most common and typical of the kinds. 

== Nature==
They were shorter and smaller than the other breeds, browner of skin, had no beards, and did not wear any footwear. They lived in holes they called ''[[smials]]'', a habit which they long preserved. 

The Harfoots liked highlands and hillsides, and were accustomed to living underground longer. They were also on very friendly terms with the [[Dwarves]], who travelled through the [[High Pass]] on the [[Great Road]].<ref name="Hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

== History==
In their earliest known history the Harfoots lived in the lower foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]], in an area roughly bounded by the [[Gladden River]] in the south and the small forested region where later was the [[Eagle's Eyrie]] near the [[High Pass]] to the north. 

They were the first to migrate westward into [[Eriador]], beginning thus the [[Wandering Days]] of the Hobbit peoples<ref name="Hobbits"/>. They were first recorded in [[Arnor]]ian records around {{TA|1050}} and it was to them that the name ''[[Perian|Periannath]]'' ([[Halflings]]) was first applied by the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]. 

They tended to settle down for long times, and founded numerous villages as far as [[Weathertop]]. By the 1300s of the [[Third Age]] they had reached [[Bree]], which long was the most western village of any Hobbits.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

The Harfoots were joined between {{TA|1150}} and {{TA|1300}} by the [[Fallohides]] and some [[Stoors]]. The Harfoots took Fallohides, a bolder breed, as their leaders.

When [[The Shire]] was colonized in [[Third Age 1601]] most of its people were Harfoots.<ref name="Hobbits"/>

==Etymology==
''Harfoots'' means "one with hairy feet", and is a translation of an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form of an old [[Westron]] name.

The word is supposed to represent archaic English ''hǣr-fōt > herfoot > harfoot''.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that Modern English ''hair'', though related, is not a direct descendant of [[Old English]] ''hǣr, hēr'' and therefore *"hairfoot" would not be a faithful translation.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 759</ref><ref group="note">However, [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hair Wiktionary] shows ''hair'' as derived directly from ''hǣr''.</ref>
