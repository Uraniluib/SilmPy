'''Eärendur''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˌe.aˈrendur]}}; {{TA|640}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|861}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 221) was the tenth and last [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Eärendur succeeded his father [[Elendur (King of Arnor)|Elendur]] on his death in {{TA|777}}. Eärendur's rule was uneventful, but he was the tenth and last [[King of Arnor]] due to dissension amongst his sons. 

After his death in {{TA|861|n}}, probably due to jealousy on the part of the two younger sons, his three sons split [[Arnor]] into three separate kingdoms: [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. 

His eldest son and rightful heir, [[Amlaith]] of [[Fornost]], became the first [[King of Arthedain]], and it was through Amlaith and his heirs that the line of Isildur endured whilst the line of kings of Rhudaur and Cardolan failed - [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] was a direct descendent of Amlaith, and it wasn't until [[Aragorn]] became king that Arnor was finally reunified.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

== Etymology==
Eärendur is a [[Quenya]] name meaning "Servant of the Sea", and is a combination of the word ''[[Eär|ëar]]'' meaning "sea", and the suffix ''[[Ndur|-ndur]]'' meaning "devotion to, friend of". It is unlikely that Eärendur himself was devoted to the sea: it is more likely that he was named after one of the two previous [[Eärendur (disambiguation)|Eärendur]]s.
