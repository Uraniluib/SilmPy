'''Durin's Folk''' were the '''Longbeards''' (''[[Sigin-tarâg]]'' in [[Khuzdul]]), one of the seven kindreds of [[Dwarves]] whose leaders were from the [[House of Durin]].  Their first king was named [[Durin]], who was one of the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
===First Age===
In the deeps of time, the Fathers of the Dwarves awoke.  Durin the eldest, who had slept alone at Mount [[Gundabad]],<ref name="Dwarves">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> wandered far, [[West]] and [[East]], and he gathered his Folk from Dwarves of other clans who followed him.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #24</ref>

As he wandered south along the [[Misty Mountains]] he came upon [[Azanulbizar]]. In the caves above [[Kheled-zâram]], he founded the city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], the home of Durin's Folk. Durin lived there so long he became known as Durin the Deathless, yet in the end he died before the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name="Durin"/>

The Dwarves of Khazad-dûm also colonized the [[Iron Hills]], which became Durin's Folk's primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref> The [[Old Forest Road|Dwarf-road of Mirkwood]] ran north-east to the Hills for the dwarf-traders and merchants between Khazad-dûm and the Hills.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, p. 323 (note 30)</ref> Durin's Folk also considered the [[Grey Mountains]], which lay between these two mansions, to be within their territory.<ref name=relations /> Those lands were harassed by [[Orcs]], but during the [[War of the Jewels]], they were called to [[Beleriand]] as [[Morgoth]] needed all available power, and the lands were left at peace.<ref name=relations />

When [[Men]] first migrated west into [[Rhovanion]] and [[Eriador]], they encountered Durin's Folk. The Longbeards were the wisest and most farseeing of the seven kindreds and began dealing with Men, establishing an economy in which Men chiefly provided food in exchange for Dwarven work in building, road-construction, mining, and the crafting of tools and weapons. The Men looked at the Dwarves with awe and were eager to learn from them. This system benefitted mostly the Dwarves, as the services they provided to Men required less effort than those offered in exchange; so they were free to continue with pursuing their labor and refine their skills.<ref name=relations />

===Second Age===
At the end of the First Age during the [[War of Wrath]] and the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]], the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] had been ruined.  In the [[Second Age]], about the year {{SA|40|n}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> many Dwarves who lived in these cities left the destruction behind and came to Khazad-dûm, increasing its wealth and power.<ref name="Durin"/> The longbeards controlled [[Erebor]], [[Ered Mithrin]], [[Ered Engrin]], and the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]] up to [[Lorien]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}</ref>{{rp|n. 30}}

Around that time also, Morgoth's Orcs, now leaderless and reckless, but still numerous, armed and cruel, returned to the East and started harassing the Dwarven lands again, as well as the more numerous Men who settled between the Grey Mountains and [[Mirkwood]]; those early [[Northmen]] were related to the former [[House of Hador]] far in [[Beleriand]]. Once more, the Dwarves provided the Men with metal weapons and defensive measures in exchange for their skill in taming and riding horses, consisting them scouts and mounted archers. Thus the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] was formed, resulting to mutual respect and aso warm friendship.<ref name=relations /> During this period the Longbeards adopted the speech of Men, keeping their own language to themselves.<ref name="Dwarves"/> <ref name=relations />

In {{SA|750|n}}, the [[Noldor]] established a new realm in [[Eregion]].  Being close to Khazad-dûm they established a friendship with Durin's Folk unlike any before between [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]].  Although both peoples were enriched, eventually the Elves succumbed to the seduction of [[Sauron]] and forged the [[Rings of Power]] (the forging of these Rings began about {{SA|1500|n}} and one was given to [[Durin III]] in Khazad-dûm<ref name="Durin"/>).  In {{SA|1693|n}} the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] began. By {{SA|1697|n}}, Eregion was [[Sack of Eregion|destroyed]] and the Dwarves briefly fought the forces of Sauron outside their western gate. This led to the gates of Khazad-dûm being shut.<ref name="SA"/> During the [[Dark Years]] of Sauron's dominion, Durin's Folk remained enclosed in Khazad-dûm, which was unassailable from without. Its wealth remained unravished, but its people began to dwindle,<ref name="SA"/> and communication between it and the Iron Hills was cut off.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref> 

In the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] in {{SA|3434|n}}, Durin's Folk sent forces to fight alongside the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and likely through the end of the [[War of the Last Alliance]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

===Third Age===
During the reign of [[Durin VI]] in the [[Third Age]], the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm delved deeper and deeper for ''[[mithril]]'', which had become increasingly harder to find. In {{TA|1980|n}} however, they accidentally awoke a hidden [[Balrogs|Balrog]] that had fled from the coming of the [[Host of the West]] in the First Age, and killed King [[Durin VI]]. Finally in {{TA|1981|n}} his son [[Náin I]] was also killed and all the people of Khazad-dûm were either destroyed or fled far away.<ref name="Durin"/>

Most of Durin's Folk escaped to the north where in {{TA|1999|n}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thráin I]] established a new capital within [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], becoming [[King under the Mountain]].  His son [[Thorin I]] left Erebor in {{TA|2210|n}}<ref name="TA"/> and travelled further north to settle in the Grey Mountains where most of Durin's Folk had gone.  For a time they prospered there for the mountains were rich.<ref name="Durin"/>

Unfortunately, there were [[Dragons|dragons]] in the wastes north of the Grey Mountains, and in {{TA|2570|n}} they began [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|making war]] against the Longbeards. The conflict came to a climax in {{TA|2589|n}} when King [[Dáin I]]<ref name="TA"/> and his second son [[Frór]] were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] outside [[Dáin's halls|his halls]].<ref name="Durin"/>  Soon after, most of Durin's Folk left the Ered Mithrin with [[Grór]], Dáin's third son, leading many followers to the Iron Hills in {{TA|2590|n}}.<ref name="TA"/>

In the same year, Dáin's first son and heir, [[Thrór]], with his uncle [[Borin]] and the remainder of the departing Longbeards, returned to Erebor. There they prospered, winning the friendship of all Men nearby, and trafficking in ore with their kin in the Iron Hills.<ref name="Durin"/> News of the wealth of Erebor spread and reached the dragons, and in {{TA|2770|n}} [[Smaug]] suddenly descended upon the Mountain, and [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] it.<ref name="TA"/>  Although many Dwarves were killed, many escaped as well. Among them were King Thrór and his family who headed south into a long homeless wandering while most of the surviving Longbeards headed east to the Iron Hills.<ref name="Durin"/>

The followers of Thrór eventually settled in [[Dunland]]<ref name="Durin"/> where in {{TA|2790|n}} Thrór left "to see what I can find."<ref name="TA"/>  With a companion, [[Nár]], he came to the east gate of Khazad-dûm and entered as a returning heir.  For days Nár waited in hiding outside until Thrór’s body was tossed from the gates by the Orc-chieftain [[Azog]], who told Nár to go warn his kin never to return to Moria.  Nár went back to [[Thráin]], Thrór's son to report what had happened. Now King and filled with anger, Thráin II sent word to all the houses of the Dwarves to prepare for war.<ref name="Durin"/>

By {{TA|2793|n}} the Dwarves had mustered a great host. Durin's Folk and large forces from the other Houses were ready to launch a [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|war of vengeance]].<ref name="TA"/> For six years, From Gundabad to the [[Gladden River|Gladden]], they sacked and assaulted every Orc dwelling they could find.  Defeating the [[Orcs]] through strength, matchless weapons, and burning anger.<ref name="Durin"/>

At last on a dark winter day in {{TA|2799|n}} the Dwarf-host came to Azanulbizar<ref name="TA"/> and found a great host of Orcs awaiting them.  Undeterred, the Dwarves, led by Thráin II, made their assault, beginning the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]].  This final battle too the Dwarves won, but at great cost.  In the end Azog was beheaded and Thrór was avenged, but the Dwarves could not take Khazad-dûm, for within still dwelt Durin's Bane.

With the war over the Dwarves dispersed.  [[Dáin Ironfoot]] led his contingent of Longbeards back to the Iron Hills.  Thráin II, with [[Thorin]], [[Balin]], [[Glóin]], and others of their following returned to Dunland.  Soon though they uprooted and wandered in Eriador until they established themselves in the northern [[Ered Luin]] beyond the [[Lhûn|Lune]].  There they prospered and their numbers slowly grew.<ref name="Durin"/>

Thráin II decided to return to Erebor in {{TA|2841|n}} but as he travelled, he and his companions were pursued by Sauron's servants.  One day in {{TA|2845|n}} Thráin was captured and imprisoned in [[Dol Guldur]].  Eventually, in {{TA|2850|n}}, [[Gandalf]] found him and received the key to Erebor, but the last of the [[Seven Rings]] had been taken and Gandalf was unable to rescue the Dwarf.<ref name="TA"/>

King Thorin II Oakenshield and his people continued to labor and traffic in the Ered Luin until one day Thorin sought and found Gandalf to solicit his counsel and aid in dealing with Smaug.  Gandalf devised a plan for burglary, employing the service of [[Bilbo Baggins]] of [[the Shire]].  The plan succeeded and Smaug was slain, but in the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]] Thorin was killed.  However his cousin Dáin Ironfoot, who led a contingent of Dwarves in the battle, entered Erebor and restored the Kingdom under the Mountain as King Dáin II.<ref name="Durin"/>

Durin's Folk grew strong in Erebor until during the [[War of the Ring]] their realm and that of the [[Kingdom of Dale]] were attacked by Sauron's northern forces.  In the [[Battle of Dale]] in {{TA|3019|n}} King Dáin II fell and thereafter the Mountain was besieged.  Upon the news of Sauron's downfall, however, the besieged routed the army of Sauron and Dáin's son, [[Thorin Stonehelm]] became the King under the Mountain as Thorin III.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>  Eventually his descendant, [[Durin VII]], would lead Durin's Folk back to Khazad-dûm .<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref>

Also after the fall of Sauron, [[Gimli]], the son of Glóin, brought some of Durin's Folk from Erebor south to [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]] and there established a new Dwarf-realm.  Gimli served as the [[Lord of the Glittering Caves]].<ref name="Durin"/>

==Inspiration==
Historically, the term "Longbeards" is the supposed original name of the [[Wikipedia:Lombards|Lombards]], but other than the name, there is no other significant similarities between the Lombards and the Durin's Folk.
