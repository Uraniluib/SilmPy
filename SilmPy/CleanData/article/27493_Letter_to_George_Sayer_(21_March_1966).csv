== Contents (from the bookseller) ==

The letter is largely personal but also discusses the publication of the second edition of the ''Lord of the Rings'' and references ''The Silmarillion'', the work Tolkien began before ''The Hobbit'' and, although not published till after Tolkien's death, was the groundwork from which all four Middle Earth books were drawn from. This is a letter of importance, Tolkien refers to the revisions made in the second edition of LOTR and assures Sayer that they were necessary and lists the reasons.<ref>Buddenbrooks, Inc. ABAA</ref>
