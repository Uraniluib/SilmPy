The '''Men''' who dwelt in '''Dale''', a township at the feet of the [[Lonely Mountain]]. 
==History==
The Men of Dale descend from [[Northmen]] of the south who came up the [[River Running]] after {{TA|2590}} when King [[Thr√≥r]] reestablished the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> There they built the town of [[Dale]].<ref name=Party>{{H|Party}}</ref>  The town shared in the prosperity of the [[Dwarves]] and it was governed by the [[Lord of Dale]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>
 
In {{TA|2770|n}}, during the time of [[Girion]], [[Smaug]] descended upon the Dwarf-kingdom.<ref name="TA"/> The Men fielded warriors against him but could not prevent the [[Sack of Erebor]]. After that, the dragon would crawl out of the [[Front Gate]] of the Mountain by night and carry away people (especially maidens) to eat. The remaining population soon fled and the deserted city fell into ruins.<ref name=Party/>

Many went to dwell on the [[Long Lake]] with the [[Lake-men]], including the last descendant of Girion, [[Bard]]. When Dale was refounded as a [[Kingdom of Dale|Kingdom]] by Bard, its people were known as [[Bardings]].<ref name="TA"/>
==Culture==
The Men of Dale flourished with trade with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]].

They spoke [[Westron]] with their own dialect, [[Dalish]].
