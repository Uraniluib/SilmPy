'''Eryn Vorn''' ([[Sindarin]] for '''Blackwood'''<ref name=RClxv/>) was a wooded cape in [[Eriador]]<ref name=UT>{{UT|6d}}</ref>, and a region of dark pine trees.<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref>

==History==

Located in western [[Minhiriath]], Eryn Vorn (likely named so by the Númenóreans) was originally part of the vast ancient treescape that covered most of north-western [[Middle-earth]]. During the Second Age, however, these forests were decimated by the [[Númenóreans]] in their greed for ship-building timber, before being almost completely burnt down by the forces of [[Sauron]] during the ensuing war in Eriador.<ref name=UT/>

By the latter half of the Second Age, the surviving natives of Minhiriath had retreated either north to [[Bree]], or hidden themselves in Eryn Vorn which was probably all that remained of the vast forests in Minhiriath for long years thereafter. 

From {{TA|861}}, Eryn Vorn nominally formed a part of [[Cardolan]] and by the end of the Third Age, scattered woodlands had reappeared in much of the rest of Minhiriath. 

It is probable that people remained hidden in Eryn Vorn by the [[Third Age]]. Although Bree was the westernmost permanent settlement of [[Men]] by the late Third Age,<ref>{{HM|RK}}</ref>{{fact}} the woods of Minhiriath were home of a few, secretive hunter-folk at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. These wild people were afraid to cross the river [[Baranduin]] because of the Elves who dwelt beyond.<ref name=UT/><ref group="note">These Elves surely are the Elves of [[Lindon]], the realm located north of the cape.<!-- noted by User:Morgan --></ref>

==Etymology==

''Eryn Vorn'' is [[Sindarin]] and has been given the translation "Blackwood". The name consists of ''[[eryn]]'' ("wood") and ''vorn'' ("dark"),<ref name=RClxv>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxv</ref> the latter being the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''[[morn]]''.<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin - the Noble Tongue: I. Soft Mutation]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 8 June 2011)</ref>

The name ''Eryn Vorn'' first appeared on [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]'' ([[1970]]), for which [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] had supplied [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/ notes] on additional names. The first printing of the map wrongly has ''Erin Voru''.<ref name=RClxv/>
