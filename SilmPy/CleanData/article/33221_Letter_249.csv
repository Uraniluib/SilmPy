==Summary==
Tolkien was in Bournemouth at the Hotel Miramar and wrote to his grandson about his experiences, all exhausting.  He had visited an "admirer" next door at the hotel, who was highly intelligent, well-read, and stone-deaf.  They had conversed by writing pad, a defeating procedure.  The next day he had helped rescue an old lady who was staying with them.  She had begun choking on a bone at lunch and Tolkien had taken her to a doctor.  After that he visited another deaf old lady!  She was nearly the last child of [[Wikipedia:James Murray (lexicographer)|Sir James August Henry Murray]] (founder of the Oxford English Dictionary).  She had been researching the [[Wikipedia:John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie#Gowrie conspiracy|Gowrie conspiracy]] but Tolkien found this bit of Scots history – who murdered whom and why – difficult to follow.
