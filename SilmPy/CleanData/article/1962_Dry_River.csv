'''Dry River''' was the name given to the dry bed of what had once been a tributary of the River [[Sirion]] rising in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. It had joined the Sirion just north of the [[Ford of Brithiach]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  At the northern end of its gully lay the entrance to the Hidden City of [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==History==
In primeval times (before the awakening of the [[Elves]]) the Dry River was filled with water; it drained a lake in the Encircling Mountains.  Once the lake was gone the lake became the valley of [[Tumladen]] and the bed of the Dry River provided a defensible pathway into the hidden area.<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Dry River''</ref>

[[Aredhel]] and her son [[Maeglin]], fleeing [[Eöl]], sought and found their way up the Dry River into Gondolin in {{FA|400}}<ref>{{GA|120}}</ref>.  Unbeknownst to them Eöl followed them, also found the Dry River, and tried to enter Tumladen by stealth.  He was captured and brought to King [[Turgon]].<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

King Turgon led an army ten thousand strong down the Dry River and up the [[Sirion]] in {{FA|472|n}}<ref>{{GA|221}}</ref> where they participated in the ''[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]''.  When the battle went against the Elves and Men [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]] held back the forces of [[Morgoth]] to allow Turgon to escape.  Turgon's army marched to the Dry River and vanished into the mountains.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

In {{FA|496|n}}<ref>{{GA|298}}</ref> [[Voronwë]] led [[Tuor]] to the Dry River and thence through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]] to Gondolin.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>  Tuor did not leave Gondolin by way of the Dry River; when the city fell he, [[Idril]], [[Eärendil]], and other refugees escaped by the dreadful [[Cirith Thoronath]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

After being released by [[Morgoth]], in {{FA|500}}, Húrin wandered into [[Hithlum]].  In the succeeding year<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref> he attempted to find access to Gondolin, but by then the Dry River entrance was blocked.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
