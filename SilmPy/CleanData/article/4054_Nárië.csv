'''Nárië''' ([[Nórui]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the sixth month of the year in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] of [[Gondor]], following [[Lótessë]], and preceding [[Loëndë]] ([[Mid-year's Day]]). In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the third month of the year, immediately preceding [[Cermië]].

''Nárië'' in the Kings' Reckoning and in the Stewards' Reckoning corresponded, for the most part, to [[Forelithe]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[22 May]] through [[20 June]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
