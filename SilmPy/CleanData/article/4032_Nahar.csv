'''Nahar''' was the legendary horse ridden by [[Oromë]], the [[Huntsman of the Valar]]. Nahar's coat was said to be white under the [[Sun]], but to shimmer in silver in the night,<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref> and his feet were shod in gold.<ref name="coming">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

==History==
In {{YT|1085}}<ref>{{MR|P2a}}</ref> Oromë was riding and hunting east near the [[Orocarni]] when Nahar gave a great neighing and stood still.  Wondering, Oromë too went still and heard afar the singing of many voices.  Thus Nahar alerted his master to the existence of the awakened [[Elves]].  Later, in {{YT|1105}},<ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref> when the hosts of the [[Eldalië]] left [[Cuiviénen]], Oromë rode Nahar at their head.<ref name="coming"/>

After [[Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]] had attacked the [[Two Trees]] in [[Valinor]] in {{YT|1495}}<ref>{{MR|P2j}}</ref> a terrible darkness fell upon the land.  [[Manwë]] perceived a Darkness beyond dark moving northward and Oromë began a pursuit.  The sparks struck from the hooves of Nahar were the first light that returned to Valinor.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The [[Quenya]] name ''Nahar'' (probably [[Wikipedia:Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], from the neighing) was adapted from [[Valarin]] '''''næχærra'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 401</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/valarin.htm|articlename=Valarin - like the glitter of swords|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=29 April 2012}}</ref>
