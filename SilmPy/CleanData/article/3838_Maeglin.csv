'''Maeglin''' was an [[Elves|Elf]], the son of [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] and [[Aredhel]] daughter of [[Fingolfin]]. He lived in the [[First Age]] of [[Middle-earth]] and was a lord of [[Gondolin]], chief of the [[House of the Mole]]. 

==History==

===Early History===

Aredhel had left Gondolin to wander through [[Beleriand]], and in the woods of [[Nan Elmoth]] she met [[Eöl]], and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. The child grew up hearing tales of Gondolin, the Hidden City and his uncle, Turgon, most importantly that he had no heir to the throne, thus the idea of leaving the dark places of Nan Elmoth was born in his mind. Years later Aredhel left Eöl and she took her son (who stole his father's sword, [[Anguirel]]) with her, both of them returning to Gondolin. Eöl had followed her. In judgment before [[Turgon]] he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart when told he could not leave Gondolin, but hit Aredhel instead when she sprang before the dart. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls, under Maeglin's eyes, his father saying he would die the same death.

He was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an elven lord held in high esteem, even leading his own [[House of the Mole]]. He found rich lodes of metals in the [[Echoriath]] surrounding the city, and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named ''[[Anghabar]]'', Iron-Mine. In the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], "Battle of Unnumbered Tears", Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon proving valiant at need, though he was wise in council as well. The seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the [[Gate of Steel]], was Maeglin's creation.

Even though he was one of the mighty of Gondolin, he most desired Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] who was his first cousin. But there was no hope for him, as the "[[Eldar]] wedded not with kin so near". Moreover, Idril perceived an evil coming from him and for as long as Gondolin existed, she avoided him. Thus the love inside Maeglin's heart turned to darkness and though he had neither her nor the kingship of Gondolin, he endured it in silence, waiting for an opportunity to seize them both.

===The Fall of Gondolin===

When [[Tuor]] came, carrying [[Ulmo]]'s warning of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. Tuor's marriage with Idril further incensed Maeglin, who rebelled against Turgon and Tuor. Later, seeking after metals, Maeglin defied Turgon's order to stay within the mountains, and was captured by [[Orcs]] and brought to [[Angband]].  [[Morgoth]] promised both Gondolin and Idril in return for the location of the hidden city, thus luring Maeglin into the greatest treachery done in the [[Elder Days]].  He gave him a token that would allegedly keep him safe from the sack.

Maeglin returned to Gondolin saying nothing about his encounter, but many people noticed a change.  Most thought it was for the better, though Idril suspected something and began work on [[Idril's secret way]].  He managed to turn some of the weaker lords, such as [[Salgant]] and the roguish to his side.  When the hosts of Morgoth surrounded the city, when Eärendil was seven, Maeglin counseled Turgon against flight, and because of his place in the King's heart he swayed him to his advantage.  As the battle over Gondolin took place, Maeglin tried to kill [[Eärendil]] and take Idril for himself. But Tuor caught up with him and they fought upon the walls of the city. Maeglin lost and he was thrown down to his death, striking the mountain three times before falling into the flames.

==Etymology==
''Maeglin'' means "sharp glance" in [[Sindarin]], a name which he received from his father when he was twelve. It is formed by the union of ''[[maeg]]'', which translates as "sharp" or "piercing", "penetrating" and ''[[glîn]]'', meaning "gleam", "glint" (of eyes). At birth, Aredhel gave Maeglin the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of ''[[Lómion]]'', meaning "Child of Twilight" in [[Quenya]]. It comes from ''[[lómë]]'', a noun that translates as "dusk", "twilight" and also "night".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>
