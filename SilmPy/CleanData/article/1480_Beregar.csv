'''Beregar''' was a nobleman of [[Númenor]], descended from the [[House of Bëor]]. 
__NOTOC__
== History ==
Beregar was a descendant of [[Beleth]], daughter of [[Bregolas]], of the [[House of Bëor]].<ref name=WJBeor>{{WJ|14}}, ''(i) House of Bëor''</ref> 

He lived in the region of Númenor known as the [[Westlands]]. Beregar married [[Núneth]] and they had a daughter named [[Erendis]], whom Beregar brought to the feast held when the son of [[Tar-Meneldur]] was proclaimed as his heir.  There Erendis became enamoured of [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] and eventually became his queen. Aldarion and Erendis had a daughter of their own, and so Beregar became the grandfather of the first [[Ruling Queen of Númenor]], [[Tar-Ancalimë]].<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>
