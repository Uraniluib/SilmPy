'''Quanta Sarmë''' was a spelling of [[Tengwar]] devised by [[Fëanor]] in [[Valinor]] which used full letters for [[ómëar|vowels]], rather than [[tehtar]].

Unlike [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil of Tirion]], Fëanor considered vowels as independent sounds and not just "colours" of the consonants; it was his preferred (and perhaps intended) way of writing, however its use is mentioned to be connected only with the [[Lambengolmor]], and for special purposes only.

No texts of this original system are known, and its usage and characters are a mystery, but it is said that it was used in [[Middle-earth]] for other languages, like [[Sindarin]], where the tehta-mode was considered inconvenient. 

It is possible (and indeed very likely) that the [[Mode of Beleriand]] was one of those systems originating from the ''Quanta''; the letter ''[[Ossë (tengwa)|ossë]]'' is maybe the only remnant of that (otherwise extinct) system.
==Possible examples==
Although nothing is known about the Quanta Sarme, these examples suppose that it used the letter Ossë and [[Úrë]] as a vowel.
