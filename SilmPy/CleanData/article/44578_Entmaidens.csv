'''Entmaidens''' were young female [[Ents]] or young [[Entwives]]. When [[Treebeard]], talking to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], remembered old times, when "the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild", he said that "there were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of [[Fimbrethil]], of Wandlimb the lightfooted, in the days of our youth!"<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>
