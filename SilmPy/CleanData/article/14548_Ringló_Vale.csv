:Ringló Vale was an area in the region of Central Gondor, located east of [[Lamedon]] in Western Gondor and north of [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. Its emblem was a golden trout on a blue field. During the [[War of the Ring]], the elderly "Lord Borhador" ruled from the Crossing-Hall in [[Ethring]], the only settlement. He was assisted by his other son "Arvaethor" in [[Dervorin]]'s absence. The Vale was threatened by [[spiders]], [[White Mountains|White Mountain]] [[Orcs]], [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] scouts, and the twice-traitorous [[Oathbreakers]] known as the Ruthless Dead. Southwest of Ethring was the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] of "Eilendoth".
