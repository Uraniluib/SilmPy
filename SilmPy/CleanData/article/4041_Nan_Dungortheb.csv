[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Aredhel Escapes Nan Dungortheb.jpg|thumb|right|"Aredhel Escapes Nan Dungortheb" by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]'''Nan Dungortheb''' was the dreadful valley in northern [[Beleriand]] that ran west to east between the haunted mountains of the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] and the enchanted northern marches of [[Doriath]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
After [[Ungoliant]] fled [[Lammoth]] and the [[Balrogs]] of [[Morgoth]] she made her way to the valley below the Ered Gorgoroth.  There she bred such horrors that the valley was given the name Nan Dungortheb.  After she had departed the land was infested with her offspring.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>  Waters that spilled into the valley from the Ered Gorgoroth were defiled, filling the hearts of those that drank of them with madness and despair.  All living things other than the spiders avoided the valley, including the [[Ã‘oldor]] who would only cross it by paths nearest to Doriath.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

When [[Aredhel]], daughter of [[Fingolfin]], attempted to ride eastward across Nan Dungortheb her party was separated by the shadows.  While she succeeded in reaching [[Himlad]] her companions could not find her and were chased away by the spiders.  Returning to [[Gondolin]] they reported her as lost to [[Turgon]].<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

[[Beren]], sorely pressed by the forces of [[Morgoth]] who sought for him in [[Dorthonion]], passed over the Ered Gorgoroth and crossed Nan Dungortheb from north to south.  He never spoke of his journey through this land lest the horror of it return to his mind.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

== Etymology ==

The name ''Nan Dungortheb'' is translated as "Valley of Dreadful Death",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> containing the word ''nan'' ("valley").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry for ''nan(d)''</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the land was identified as '''Nan Dumgorthin''', the "Land of the Dark Idols". Instead of being inhabited by the offspring of Ungoliant (who never ventured to Middle-earth in this version), it is populated by strange Men that worshipped mysterious deities.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, pp. 35, 62, 374</ref>
