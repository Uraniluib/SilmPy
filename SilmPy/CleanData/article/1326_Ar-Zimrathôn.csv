}}'''Ar-Zimrathôn''' was the son and heir to [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]], and became the twenty-first [[King of Númenor]]. His father was the first King to take his name in the [[Adûnaic]] tongue, and Ar-Zimrathôn established this tradition by doing the same, though the [[Quenya]] form of his name, [[Tar-Hostamir]], was also recorded. 

Ar-Zimrathôn held the Sceptre of [[Númenor]] for seventy-one years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as [[Ar-Sakalthôr]].<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Ar-Zimrathôn</ref>

==Etymology==
''Zimrathôn'' seems to mean "Collector of Jewels" in [[Adûnaic]], though this can only be asserted from his Quenya name. His [[Quenya]] name, ''Tar-Hostamir'' means "Collector of Jewels" from ''[[hosta]]'', "gather, collect" and ''[[mir]]'', "jewel".{{fact}}
