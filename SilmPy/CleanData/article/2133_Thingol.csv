'''Thingol''' ({{IPA|[ˈθiŋɡol]}}), also known as '''Elu''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈelu]}}), was the [[King of Doriath]] and a High King of the Sindar. Known as '''[[Elwë]]''' during the first years of the [[Eldar]], he was the older brother of [[Olwë]] and [[Elmo]].<ref group="note">[[Elmo]] is a later addition by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and is not in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.</ref> He was also a good friend of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]]. His hair was silver and he was the tallest of all Elves and Men.<ref name="Princes">{{S|Princes}}</ref> As the ''de facto'' "Lord of Beleriand", Thingol would become a central figure of the [[First Age]], instigating the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], the greatest victory of the Age, but ultimately the cause of his own doom.

==History==
===Ambassador of the Valar===
Thingol was born at [[Cuiviénen]]<ref group="note">This information is from the ''[[Cuivienyarna]]'', part of ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]'', a late revision of the [[legendarium]] by Tolkien. ''The Silmarillion'' does not clarify whether Elu Thingol ''awoke'' at Cuiviénen or was ''born'' there. See [[Awakening of the Elves]].</ref> in the days before the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]], when [[Middle-earth]] was lit only by starlight. 

After the [[Chaining of Melkor]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Oromë]] took three Elves, [[Ingwë]], Finwë, and Elwë, to [[Valinor]] to convince the [[Elves]] to join the Valar in the [[Blessed Realm]]. Upon their return, the Elven ambassadors convinced many to join them on the [[Great Journey]] to the West.  During the thousand mile journey, the Elven host separated into three groups, the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the [[Teleri]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

The Teleri, led by Elwë and his brother Olwë, were the largest and the slowest group, and were the last to reach the western shores of [[Middle-earth]]. The Noldorin Elves had already left for Valinor, and the Teleri were forced to wait for a time in Middle-earth.
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian.jpg|thumb|left|Elena Kukanova - ''Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian'']]
During this time Elwë wandered into the [[Nan Elmoth|Forest of Nan Elmoth]], where he met and fell in love with [[Melian]] the [[Maiar|Maia]]. Caught in an enchantment of their own making, Elwë and Melian could not be found by the searching Teleri. When the Valar returned to take the remaining Elves to Valinor, only some of them followed Olwë across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. The rest had come to love the lands of [[Beleriand]] and refused to leave without their missing lord.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

===King of Doriath===
[[Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - Elwe Heraldic Device.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Thingol's device by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]]]Over two hundred years passed before Elwë appeared again with his bride Melian, much changed since when last they saw him. While he had been fair and noble before, he now stood like a Maia above them as the tallest of the Children of Ilúvatar. He gathered his people together and founded the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. His subjects would become the [[Sindar]], or the "Grey Elves", and their language was [[Sindarin]]. From then on Elwë was known as King Elu Thingol, and he claimed lordship over all the lands in Beleriand. While Thingol was King of the Grey Elves, who never saw the light of the [[Two Trees]], as an Ambassador of the Valar he was counted as a [[High Elves|High Elf]], and equal to any lord of the [[Eldar]].<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref><ref name="Princes">{{S|Princes}}</ref>

On Melian's advice, Thingol became an ally of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]], who carved the caverns of [[Menegroth]] for him. In payment he gave them, along with many other things, the great pearl [[Nimphelos]].<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

A thousand years before the first rising of the Sun and the Moon the [[Green-elves]] entered Beleriand under [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]]. Thingol welcomed them and gave them the lands of [[Ossiriand]], which they named [[Lindon]]. The Green Elves told of the spread of the [[Orcs]] and other foul creatures in the north and east of Middle-earth. The Grey Elves began arming themselves.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

Centuries later [[Melkor]] returned to Middle-earth. Now named Morgoth, he had destroyed the Two Trees, killed Finwë, the King of the Noldor, and stolen the fabled [[Silmarils]]. Seeking to claim dominion quickly, he launched a sudden assault on the lands of the Sindar. The [[First Battle of Beleriand]] went well for Thingol, who prevented any Orcs from invading Doriath, but the Green Elves took horrific losses and the [[Falathrim]] were besieged.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

The Falathrim were finally saved by the unexpected arrival of the Noldor, who launched the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] ("Battle Under the Stars") in which Morgoth's forces were all but annihilated.<ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref>

===Thingol and the Noldor===
[[File:Elena Kukanova - King of Doriath.jpg|thumb|left|Elena Kukanova - ''King of Doriath'']]
After the First Battle of Beleriand, Doriath was encircled by the [[Girdle of Melian]], an impenetrable fence of enchantment that guarded the kingdom.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> While his own kingdom was protected, Thingol was still loath to surrender any other lands in Beleriand to the Noldor as he was suspicious of the aggressive new lords in Middle-earth.<ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref>
{{quote|In [[Hithlum]] the Noldor have leave to dwell, and in the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], and in the lands east of Doriath that are empty and wild... for I am the Lord of Beleriand, and all who seek to dwell there shall hear my word.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "Of the Return of the Noldor"}}

King Thingol's relations with the Noldor were strained, and grew worse decades later when he learned the truth of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. Thingol banned the use of [[Quenya]] in his lands, which led to [[Sindarin]] being the common Elven tongue in Middle-earth. The King of Doriath refused to aid the Noldor in the war against Morgoth, and took little part in the ongoing struggle.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>

===The Quest for the Silmaril===
[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Beren at Thingol's Court.jpg|thumb|Felix Sotomayor - ''Beren at Thingol's Court'']]
Thingol and Melian had one child, a daughter named [[Lúthien]], said to be the fairest woman ever to live. Lúthien fell in love with a [[Men|Man]] named [[Beren]]. Thingol did not wish for the two to wed, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked Men.  As a bride-price he asked for a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from the crown of [[Morgoth]], thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand.<ref name="Beren">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

However, when Beren and Lúthien came back from [[Angband]], and when Beren showed him his missing hand which still held the Silmaril in the belly of [[Carcharoth]], he softened his heart towards him. Soon, though, Carcharoth in his anguish and rage from the Silmaril that burned his insides, broke through the Girdle of Melian and entered Doriath. In that hour, Thingol, along with Beren, [[Mablung]], [[Beleg]] and [[Huan]] the Hound of Valinor, began the [[Hunting of the Wolf|hunt of the Wolf]]. Carcharoth was finally slain by Huan, but both Huan and Beren died in the process. After that, Lúthien died also, and coming to the [[Halls of Mandos]] she begged [[Mandos]] that Beren be returned to life. However, it was beyond the power of Mandos to withhold the souls of Men from going beyond the [[Circles of the World]].<ref name="Beren">{{S|Beren}}</ref>


Therefore, [[Ilúvatar]], through [[Manwë]], offered her and Beren to live again, but with Lúthien sharing the [[Gift of Men]]. She agreed, and they both came back to life, and lived the remainder of their lives at [[Tol Galen]], far from the sight of any other mortals.<ref name="Beren">{{S|Beren}}</ref>

===Fostering of Túrin===
Thingol adopted as a son a young Man named [[Túrin]], son of [[Húrin]] and akin to Beren himself, who was sent to Doriath when he was seven years old.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref> When he grew up, he was permitted to join Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the Orcs of Morgoth.<ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|5}}</ref>

Túrin accidentally caused the death of [[Saeros]], one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven he fled. Thingol however gave Beleg a leave to seek out his friend, who in the meantime had joined a [[Gaurwaith|band of outlaws]].<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref> Telling to Thingol that Túrin did not wish to return, Thingol allowed Beleg to go and join his friend and gave him the black sword [[Anglachel]] that [[Eöl]] had forged and given to Thingol<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> in tribute.<ref name="Turin">{{S|Turin}}</ref>

===The Nauglamír and Thingol's Doom===
[[File:Henning Janssen - Nauglamir and the Doom of Thingol.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henning Janssen]] - ''Nauglamir and the Doom of Thingol'']]
Some time after Túrin's tragic death, Húrin, Túrin's father and now an old man, was allowed to enter Menegroth with a band of outlaws, where in anger he threw the [[Nauglamír]], the treasure of [[Nargothrond]] before King Thingol and 'thanked' him for aiding his son. This infuriated the outlaws, who tried to take the gold back but were killed by Thingol's guards.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref> Melian finally pierced through Húrin's madness and grief; shamed by his actions, he left Menegroth a broken man.<ref name="Doriath">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

At that time a desire came into Thingol's heart to take the Nauglamír and place the Silmaril in it, thus melding together two of the greatest creations made by the Elves and the [[Dwarves]]. He hired some [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarven craftsmen]] to do it for him. But by the time the Dwarves were finished they had become obsessed with the Nauglamír and asked for it as a payment for their labor. This infuriated Thingol, who had also grown obsessed with the jewelry and refused to give it as a payment, realizing they were coveting the Silmaril. The Dwarves were angered by his harsh words, and killed him. This led to the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|sacking of Menegroth]] and the eventual [[Second Kinslaying|destruction of Doriath]], which scattered its people.<ref name="Doriath">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

==Etymology==
His [[epessë]] (honorary name) was ''Thingol'' (''[[thind]]'' "grey" and ''[[coll]]'' "mantle") which means "Greycloak".<ref name=Thingol>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>

{{Pronounce|Elwe Singollo.mp3|Ardamir}}
[[Quenya]] tradition names him ''[[Elwë]]'' and ''[[Singollo]]'', for the [[Noldor]] pronounced his epessë as '''Singollo''' (pron. {{IPA|[siŋˈɡolːo]}}).

His first name, Elwë, means "star-man" and contains ''[[el]]'' and ''[[-we]]''.

'''Elwë Þindicollo''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈelwe ˌθindiˈkolːo]}}) or '''Sindicollo''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌsindiˈkolːo]}}) was the ancient name of King [[Thingol]]; when he settled in [[Doriath]] with [[Melian]], he took the [[Sindarin]] form of his name, [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]].
