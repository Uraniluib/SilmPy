The '''Girdle of Melian''' was the fence of enchantment set around [[Thingol]]'s kingdom of [[Doriath]] by [[Melian]] his Queen, preventing entry into his land without his will and consent. [[Beren]] was unique in being the only person to pass through the Girdle without the knowledge of Doriath's rulers.  The protection of the Girdle encompassed the Forests of [[Neldoreth]] and [[Forest of Region|Region]], the West March of [[Nivrim]], and part of [[Aelin-uial]], the Twilight Meres.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

The name of Doriath means "Land of the Fence"<ref name=silmindex>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 370, 378</ref> or "Land of the Girdle"<ref name=SSindar>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>. Accordingly, the [[Sindar]] who dwelt inside Doriath were called Iathrim, the "People of the Fence"<ref>{{WJ|B}}, 3</ref> (''[[iâth]]'' meaning fence in [[Sindarin]]).
==History==
Upon the return of [[Morgoth]] from [[Valinor]] he sent his [[Orcs]] in a great army to assail King Thingol.  Although the [[Elves]] defeated the eastern host of Orcs it was a costly victory (his ally, [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] of [[Ossiriand]], was killed with all his kin) and the western force of Orcs were successful in driving [[Círdan]] to the shores.  Thingol therefore withdrew his people into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian used her power to encircle this dominion with an invisible wall of shadows and bewilderment.  The land of Eglador was thereafter called Doriath, the guarded kingdom.<ref name=SSindar/>

After years of outlawry in [[Dorthonion]], in {{FA|464}}<ref>{{GA|174}}</ref> [[Beren]] passed through the Girdle of Melian, able to do so because (as Melian had foretold) his doom was greater than her power.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>  After the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] Beren was in Doriath when the Girdle was again breached, this time by [[Carcharoth]] the Wolf, who penetrated the Girdle due to his fate and the power of the [[Silmaril]] he had swallowed.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

Upon the death of King Thingol in {{FA|502}} Melian departed from [[Middle-earth]] and with her departure the Girdle of Melian vanished.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
