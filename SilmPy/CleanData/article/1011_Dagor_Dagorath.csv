The '''Final Battle''', also known as the '''Second Prophecy of Mandos''', but probably best known as the '''Dagor Dagorath''' ([[Sindarin]], "Battle of all Battles"), is an apocalyptic event prophesied by [[Mandos]]. According to Christopher Tolkien, the Dagor Dagorath was abandoned by Tolkien.<ref name="Valaquenta">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', "[[Valaquenta]]"</ref>

== The Prophecy ==
According to the prophecy, included in both [[The Shaping of Middle-earth]] and in [[The Lost Road]], [[Morgoth|Melkor]] will eventually discover how to break the [[Door of Night]], allowing him to escape his imprisonment beyond the world. Intent on regaining his dominion over [[Middle-earth]] and avenging his previous defeat, the fallen Ainu will recreate his greatest servants (including [[Sauron]]) and destroy the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]]. For the love of these, [[Eärendil]] will return from the sky and meet [[Tulkas]], [[Manwë]] (or [[Eönwë]] his herald) and [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] on the plains of [[Valinor]]. All the Free Peoples of Middle-earth will participate in this final battle, [[Elves]], [[Men]], and [[Dwarves]] alike. Also in the Battle will be [[Ar-Pharazôn]] and the [[Númenóreans]] who broke the [[Ban of the Valar|Ban]] and landed at [[Aman]] in {{SA|3319}}. These Númenóreans of the [[Great Armament]] were not destroyed, but are imprisoned in the [[Caves of the Forgotten]], where they await the ending of the world. The role that they have to play in the Last Battle is unknown. 

Thus assembled, the forces of the [[Valar]] shall fight against Melkor. Tulkas will wrestle with him, but it will be by the hand of Túrin that finally death and utter defeat will be dealt to Melkor. Túrin will run his black sword [[Gurthang]] (Iron of Death) through Melkor's dark heart, thus avenging the [[Children of Húrin]], and the [[Pelóri]] Mountains will be leveled. In other versions of the legendarium, however (see [[The History of Middle-earth]]), [[Eönwë]], then called Fiönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for [[Arien]] (previously named Urwendi), instead of Túrin. ''This is said at the end of [[The Hiding of Valinor]].'' 

After the battle, the [[Silmarils]] will be recovered from the Earth, Sea, and Sky. [[Fëanor]]'s spirit shall be released from the [[Halls of Mandos]], and he will finally surrender his prized creations to [[Yavanna]], who will break the Silmarils and use their Light to rekindle the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]]. With the flattening of the Pelóri, the light of the Trees will cover all of [[Arda]]. The battle will end and renew Arda's existence: all the Elves shall awaken and the Powers will be young again, in the state of a [[Arda Unmarred|Renewed Arda]]. Also, according to Dwarven legends, they will help their maker [[Aulë]] recreate Arda in all its glory again.

Following this, there will be a Second [[Music of the Ainur]]. This song will sing into being a new world. Both Elves and Men will sing with the Ainur. It is unknown what the fate of the old races, or of the old world, will be in the new one. Even the Ainur do not know anything of the second world or the Second Music. All the Ainur know is that the Second Music will be greater than the First Music.
