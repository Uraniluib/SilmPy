* Pet monkeys in South Africa?
{{quote|Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end.

Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the South.|[[Helm's Deep]], [[The Lord of the Rings]]}}

{{quote|She [Tolkien’s aunt Grace] alleged that the family name ['Tolkien'] had originally been ‘von Hohenzollern’, for they had emanated from the Hohenzollern district of the Holy Roman Empire. A certain George von Hohenzollern had, she said, fought on the side of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria at the Siege of Vienna in 1529. He had shown great daring in leading an unofficial raid against the Turks and capturing the Sultan’s standard.

{{quote|Keen, heart-piercing was her song as the song of the lark that rises from the gates of night and pours its voice among the dying stars, seeing the sun behind the walls of the world; and the song of Lúthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed.|[[The Silmarillion]]}}

In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you [Christopher Tolkien] have seen them, and she could sing – and dance. <br /><br />For ever (especially when alone) we still met in the woodland glade, and went hand in hand many times to escape the shadow of imminent death before our last parting.|[[Letter 340]], [[The Letters of J.R.R.
