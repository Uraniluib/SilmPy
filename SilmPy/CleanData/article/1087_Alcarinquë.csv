'''Alcarinquë''' was a name of one of the [[stars]] in [[Arda]].<ref name=SI>{{S|Index}}</ref>
==History==
In the distant past, at the time of the awakening of the [[Elves]], [[Varda]] added many brilliant stars to the heavens using the shimmering dews of [[Telperion]] the Silver Tree.<ref name="Captivity">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> Among these were the familiar star-patterns we still know today, and other lights that were not truly stars. Among these was ''Alcarinquë'' - the planet we know as [[Wikipedia:Jupiter|Jupiter]].<ref name=MRS/>

''Alcarinquë'' would likely have been the brightest object in the skies at that time.  When Varda created Alcarinquë and the other new lights the Elves first awoke.<ref name="Captivity"/>  It was not until the Elves had been to [[Aman]] and the [[Noldor]] were returning to [[Middle-earth]] that the Moon and the Sun were created<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref> and Venus - the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] of [[Eärendil]] - was not placed in the heavens until much later.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>
