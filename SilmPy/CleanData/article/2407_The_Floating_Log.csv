'''The Floating Log''' was an inn in the village of [[Frogmorton]], in [[the Shire]]'s [[Eastfarthing]]. The Floating Log stood on the [[East Road]] that passed through [[the Shire]], about halfway between [[Hobbiton]] and the [[Brandywine Bridge]], and so must have been a busy place. In the time of the [[War of the Ring]], though, [[Sharkey]] and his [[Men]] took over the Shire, and shut the inn down.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
