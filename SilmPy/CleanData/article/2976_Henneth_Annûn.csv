'''Henneth Annûn''' was a hidden [[Gondor|Gondorian]] outpost north-east of [[Cair Andros]] in North [[Ithilien]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Faramir]] son of Steward [[Denethor|Denethor II]] had his base of operations there, and [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] were taken there by his company.

This secret dwelling consisted of a cave behind a west-facing waterfall, the [[Window-curtain]], overlooking an oval pool. The cave had been excavated by the stream feeding the waterfall, which originally fell from the hole in the cliff constituting the window in the name, but that stream had since been diverted and the tunnel sealed, save for a concealed entrance.<ref name="Window">{{TT|IV5}}</ref>

==History==
In the days of [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Túrin II]] most of the remaining people of Ithilien departed due to the influx of Mordor-orcs.<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> In response, in {{TA|2901}} he had Henneth Annûn constructed as a secret refuge for the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Other outposts were also established but Henneth Annûn was the longest guarded and manned.<ref name="Stewards"/>

On [[1 March]] {{TA|3019|n}} Faramir left [[Minas Tirith]] to go to Henneth Annûn to prepare a raid against enemy soldiers marching north through Ithilien. When the raid occurred on [[7 March]] Faramir also met Frodo and Sam, and afterwards brought them to the hidden cave.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>

Frodo and Sam were led blindfolded into the cave and had their eyes uncovered just as sunset shown through the curtain of water. Faramir fed and spoke with the two travellers, gradually gaining their trust until Sam accidentally revealed Frodo's possession of [[the One Ring]]. Faramir though resisted any temptation to seize it for himself. Later in the night [[Gollum]] came to the forbidden pool beneath the cave. In order to save his life Frodo had to draw in the creature until Faramir's men could capture him. Frodo convinced Faramir to spare Gollum even though Faramir had his doubts.

On the morning of [[8 March]] Frodo, Sam, and Gollum were allowed to depart from Henneth Annûn to continue their journey into [[Mordor]]. The next day Faramir and his men vacated the refuge;<ref name="Great"/> three followed their captain to Minas Tirith while the remainder of the company rode to [[Osgiliath]].<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> The refuge remained abandoned during the rest of the War of the Ring.
