'''Orc-holds''' is a term used to refer to underground tunnellings of the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], found throughout the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Mount Gundabad]]. From there they caused trouble in the nearby regions, such as [[Eriador]], [[Lothl√≥rien]] and [[the Shire]].

Mount Gundaband was the capital of Orcs in the North after its first sack in the [[Second Age]]. Major Orcish opperations such as battles during the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] and the [[Battle of Five Armies]]<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> were from it.

[[Orc|Orkish]] holds included [[Moria]] and the underground [[Goblin-town]] led by the [[Great Goblin]].<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>
