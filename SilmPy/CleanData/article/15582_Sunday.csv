==Etymology==
''Sunday'' represents an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form "Sunnendei", a word preserved in the [[Yellowskin]]. It is dedicated to the [[Sun]].<ref name=cal/>

''Sunday'' is translated as "Sunday" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' but it was not the chief day of the Hobbitish week, that being Friday. For this reason there was one exception, and the "Sunday" referred in the poem ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'', actually refers to the Hobbitish [[Highday|Friday]].<ref name=cal/><ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
