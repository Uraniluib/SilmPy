Following the theatrical release of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], [[Howard Shore]] reworked the film scores of the trilogy into a more structured six-movement work for orchestra and choir, loosely titled '''The Lord of the Rings Symphony'''. 

It has been performed in various concert halls around the world, accompanied by a light and visual art show by [[Alan Lee]] and [[John Howe]]. Recordings of the symphony have yet to be released.
