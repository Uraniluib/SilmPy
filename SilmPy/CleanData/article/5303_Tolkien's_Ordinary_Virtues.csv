== From the publisher ==

[[The Lord of the Rings]] offers us essential lessons in living. Here we discover ordinary virtues like generosity, pity, hospitality and rest. We meet extraordinary people like Bilbo, Gandolf, Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel. We learn about the roots of destruction in pride and betrayal. And we find the ingredients for success, such as community and sacrifice.
