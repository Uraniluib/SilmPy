The '''North Stair''' was the ancient way to travel between the lake of [[Nen Hithoel]] and the foot of the Falls of [[Rauros]].  When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] was camped above [[Sarn Gebir]], [[Boromir]] objected to traveling across the lake, pretending that there was no way down past the falls.  [[Aragorn]] sternly reminded him of the stairway and the possibility of carrying their boats to the lower river.<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref>  Later, when the Company was awaiting [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]’s decision at [[Parth Galen]], Aragorn spoke to the others about the great works in the area, including the great Stair “beside the falls”.<ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>  It was not stated in the book but presumably the North Stair was on the western side of the river where there was firmer land opposite the [[Nindalf]] marshes.
