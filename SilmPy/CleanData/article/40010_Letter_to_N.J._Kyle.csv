==Excerpt==

Tolkien writes that he has not "''in fact looked at [[The Silmarillion]] for over a year and a great deal needs to be done on it ... As far as I can see, there can be no more books about [[hobbits]] but of course hobbits will feature in this new book The Silmarillion though, as you know, the tale will deal with the age prior to that in [[The Lord of the Rings]].''"
