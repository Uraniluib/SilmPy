''''' The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book''''' is a collection of poetry by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], published in 1962.  The book contains 16 poems, only two of which deal with [[Tom Bombadil]], a character who is most famous for his encounter with [[Frodo Baggins]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the first volume in Tolkien's best-selling ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  The rest of the poems are an assortment of bestiary verse and fairy tale rhyme.

The book was originally illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]] and later by [[Roger Garland]].

The book, like the first edition of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', is presented as if it is an actual translation from the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], and contains some background information on the world of [[Middle-earth]] which is not found elsewhere. Examples are the name of the [[Tirith Aear|tower]] at [[Dol Amroth]] and the names of the [[Rivers of Gondor|Seven Rivers of Gondor]]. There is some dispute about its canonical status since the information presented about the secondary world is considered only as folklore among the [[Hobbits]]. 

It is also notable because it uses the letter "K" instead of "C" for the /k/ sound in [[Sindarin]], a spelling variant Tolkien alternated many times in his writings.

==Expanded edition==
In 2014 was published an expanded edition of ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book'', edited by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]. The new edition includes earlier versions of several poems and the related poem ''[[Once upon a Time]]''. It also contains the formerly unpublished "predecessor of ''Perry-the-Winkle'', called ''[[The Bumpus]]'', and the complete, tantalizingly brief fragment of a prose story featuring Tom Bombadil, in the days of 'King Bonhedig'". In addition, the editors provide a new introduction and a commentary on the text.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.
