<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Trollshaws 
Short way to the East 
Trollshaws 
The land of the beast 
You may hide on the hills 
Lurk into the woods 
We have already smelt your thrills 
You can pray, you can run 
For us it's more fun, we will crush you 
And steal your goods 

Woods in the North 
By the Great East Road 
Hideout for the brutes 
Grave for the fools 

Trollshaws 
Short way to the East 
Trollshaws 
The land of the beast 
Imprudent ranger will be in danger 
Wiser one chose another road 
Mindless adventurer, hero or rogue 
Try to slain me and they'll give you gold 

They will tear your Elven ears 
Dwarven heads cut with their beard 
Daring men shall run like hell 
Deficient Hobbits eaten as well 

Castles of Arnor 
Deserted by wars 
The ancient ruins 
Liar for the grunts 

They will tear your Elven ears 
Dwarven heads cut with their beard 
Daring men shall run like hell 
Foolish Hobbits eaten as well 

Goliaths of Sauron 
Vagabonds of the night 
Denizens of Trollshaws 
Slayers of knights
