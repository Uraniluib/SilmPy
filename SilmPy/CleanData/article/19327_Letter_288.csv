==Summary==
Tolkien wrote to [[Norman Davis]] of [[Oxford University]] concerning a [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien's bust at Exeter.jpg|bust]] of Tolkien, due to be presented to the Faculty of English Library. It was made by [[Faith Faulconbridge|Faith]], [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s (first) wife. Because Tolkien himself had his doubts about the durability of plaster, he offered to let it be set in bronze at his own expense. 

==Notes==
* The bust was bronzed and presented to the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] English Faculty in [[1966]]. It is still on display in the English Faculty Library.
