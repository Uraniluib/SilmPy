'''Tharzog''' is a character in '''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''' and the first boss of that game. He was the chieftain of the [[Orcs]] of [[Mount Gram]].<ref name="Citadeltower">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>

==History==
When Tharzog heard that [[Agandaûr]] assembled an army in [[Fornost]], he travelled to Fornost and fought a way to the citadel.  Here he offered his services to Agandaûr, who accepted it after recognizing Tharzog's strength and loyalty to [[Sauron]]. Tharzog became Agandaûr's lieutenant.<ref name="backstory">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/the-game/enemies|articlename=Enemies|dated=|website=warinthenorth.com|accessed=22 February 2012}}</ref> When [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]], [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] infiltrated Fornost, Tharzog was the one who told Agandaûr that there were intruders and that [[Beleram]] - a captured [[Eagles|Eagle]] - was freed. He noticed the intruders trying to sneaking into the Citadel tower, after which he ordered to close the gate to the top of the tower. This seperated Eradan, Andriel and Farin from Elladan and Elrohir. The latter confronted Agandaûr, while he and his guard fought the earlier. He was killed by them, and his guard was slaughtered.<ref name="Citadeltower"/>

==Personality==
Unlike many other Orcs and [[Goblins]], Tharzog was truely loyal to [[Sauron]] and Agandaûr. He would sacrifice his whole guard to protect Agandaûr and ensure that Sauron's plans would be succesful. He was both very strong and quick, and was therefore most feared - with the sole exception of Agandaûr - of all creatures in Fornost.<ref name="backstory"/>
