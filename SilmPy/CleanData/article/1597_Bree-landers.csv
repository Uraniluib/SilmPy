The '''Bree-landers''' or '''Bree-folk''' were the peoples who inhabited the [[Bree-land]], [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]] who lived peaceably side by side. These two races, identified individually as the [[Bree-hobbits]] (the [[Little Folk]]) and the [[Men of Bree|Bree-men]] (the [[Big Folk]]).<ref name=pony>{{FR|I9}}</ref> 

Their main settlements were four communities scattered around the [[Bree-hill]]: [[Bree]] itself, [[Staddle]], [[Combe]] and [[Archet]]. 

==Culture==
They were a generally friendly folk, at least until the upheavals brought about by the [[War of the Ring]]. They had some dealings with the [[Shire-hobbits]], though the road between Bree and their 'colony' of the Shire was less travelled by the late [[Third Age]]. 

Bree measured time with the [[Bree Calendar]]<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref> which is obviously a [[Hobbit]]ish localization of the [[King's Reckoning]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articlename=The Reckoning of Time|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Time.html|website=Lalaith}}</ref>

They maintained their own dialect of [[Westron]]. The "Bree-dialect" did not use words like "history" and "geography" much<ref name=pony/> betraying a disinterest in lore and the outside world.
