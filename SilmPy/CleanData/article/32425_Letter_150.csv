==Summary==
Tolkien regretted that no copy for the Appendices had been sent.  He was doing his best to produce them before the end of the month.  His trouble was indecision and conflicting advice in selecting from too abundant matter, and spending too much time trying to satisfy an unfortunate promise made in Volume I of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref group="note">In the first edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' a note listed items to be in the third book: abridged family-trees, an index with explanations, and brief accounts of languages, alphabets, and calendars.</ref>  His index had reached (in rough form) the middle of ''[[The Two Towers]]''.  The "alphabets" would need blocks even in simplest form.  A map of [[Gondor]] was most urgent and he hoped to get his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] to produce one from his drafts.
