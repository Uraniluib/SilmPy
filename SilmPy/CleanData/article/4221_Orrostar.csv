'''Orrostar''' was the eastern promontory of [[Númenor]], a roughly rectangular block of land some two hundred miles west to east that was surrounded by sea on all but its western side.<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref>  A range of hills ran along its northern coast which protected the region from cold north-east winds.  Especially in its inland parts Orrostar held some of the most important farmlands of Númenor where much grain was grown.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
