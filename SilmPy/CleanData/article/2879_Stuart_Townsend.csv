Irish actor '''Stuart Townsend''' (born 1972) was originally contracted to play [[Aragorn]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] movie trilogy. He was replaced by [[Viggo Mortensen]] after just four days of shooting because director [[Peter Jackson]] felt that he was too young to convincingly portray the character.

In February of 2002, Townsend was interviewed by [http://www.ew.com Entertainment Weekly] about the experience: 

<blockquote>
''"You were originally cast in "Lord of the Rings" as Aragorn, then Viggo Mortensen stepped in just before shooting began. What happened?"''
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Two weeks ago I finally read an article where the filmmakers said, "We were totally wrong about Stuart and we accept that it was our fault," which was so nice because I did get shafted up the a--. I was there rehearsing and training for two months, then was fired the day before filming began. After that I was told they wouldn't pay me because I was in breach of contract due to not having worked long enough. I had been having a rough time with them, so I was almost relieved to be leaving until they told me I wouldn't be paid. I have no good feelings for those people in charge, I really don't. [[Peter Jackson|The director]] wanted me and then apparently thought better of it because he really wanted someone 20 years older than me and completely different.
