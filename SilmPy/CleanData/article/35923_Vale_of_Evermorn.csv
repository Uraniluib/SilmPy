The '''Vale of Evermorn''' was in the heart of [[Faery]] and could only be reached through a narrow cleft through the Outer Mountains.  In this valley the greenery surpassed the green meads of Outer Faery as they surpassed the green of springtime in mortal lands.  The air was so lucid that the red tongues of birds could be seen on the far side of the valley as they sang.  On a lawn sprinkled with lilies in the valley the Elven maidens danced.<ref>[[J.R.R.
