'''Penni''' were one of the only six tribes of the [[Avari]] mentioned. They merged with the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]].

It is suggested that the Penni belonged initially to the [[Nelyar]], and the shift of [[PQ]] ''kw'' to ''p'' had already occurred among the [[Lindar]] the [[Sundering of the Elves]].<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, p. 410</ref>
