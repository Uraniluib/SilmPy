An '''Éored''' was a division of the [[Rohirrim]] consisting of a considerable body of men, fully trained for war, who might serve for a specific term or sometimes as a permanent group.  In the early history of [[Rohan]] the number could vary, but in the days of King [[Folcwine]] a "full Éored" was defined as 120 men (including its captain) and was one hundredth part of the Full Muster of the Riders of the Mark.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 36</ref>  In times of war each [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|Marshal of the Mark]] had as part of his "household" an Éored ready for battle that he could use at his own discretion.  If the king were riding to war his Éored was called "the King's Company".<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>

In {{TA|1899}} when King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] of [[Gondor]] fought the [[Wainriders]]<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> his cavalry joined with a great Éored led by [[Marhwini]] to attack the enemy in the flank and rear (this was when an Éored did not have a strictly determined size).<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>

In {{TA|3019}} the Éored that [[Éomer]] used to pursue the [[Orcs]] to the border of [[Fangorn Forest]] had 120 men - [[Legolas]] counted 105 and Èomer stated that 15 men had been lost (and 12 horses).<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>  Later, when King [[Théoden]] rode to [[Minas Tirith]], [[Elfhelm]] commanded the Éored in which [[Dernhelm]] (and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]) rode.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word "''Éored''" actually was used by the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]]s to denote a division.
