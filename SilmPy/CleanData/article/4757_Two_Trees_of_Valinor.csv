The '''Two Trees of Valinor''' are '''[[Telperion]]''' and '''[[Laurelin]]''', the Silver Tree and the Gold that brought light to the Land of the [[Valar]] in ancient times. They were destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]], but their last flower and fruit were made by the Valar into the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]]. 

==History==

===Creation and characteristics===
The first sources of light for all of [[Arda]] were two enormous [[Two Lamps|Lamps]], Illuin, the silver one to the north and Ormal, the golden one to the south. These were cast down and destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. Afterward, the Valar went to [[Valinor]] and [[Yavanna]] sang into existence the Two Trees, silver [[Telperion]] and golden [[Laurelin]]. Telperion was considered male and Laurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill [[Ezellohar]] located outside [[Valimar]]. They grew in the presence of all of the [[Valar]], watered by the tears of [[Nienna]].

Each tree was a source of light: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves (silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of water and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was likewise collected by [[Varda]].

One "day" lasted twelve hours. Each Tree, in turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness and then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of "dawn" and "dusk" soft gold and silver light would be given off together.

===Destruction===

Jealous [[Morgoth|Melkor]] enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature [[Ungoliant]] (an ancestress of [[Shelob]]) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in a cloud of darkness, Melkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever life and light remained in them.

Again [[Yavanna]] sang and [[Nienna]] wept, but they succeeded only in reviving Telperion's last flower (to become the [[Moon]]) and Laurelin's last fruit (to become the [[Sun]]). These were assigned to [[Maiar|lesser spirits]], male [[Tilion]] and female [[Arien]], after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves.

However, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by Ungoliant, was said to now reside only in the [[Silmarils]].

==In lore== 
The Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of light were the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by [[Varda]] from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven ambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that the Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two Trees affected them most significantly.

In particular [[Thingol]] is said to have been motivated in the [[Great Journey]] by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds contentment in the light he sees in [[Melian]]'s face). Also in later times, the Elves would be divided between the ''[[Calaquendi]]'' who had seen the light of the Trees, and the ''[[Moriquendi]]'' who had not, with the former group explicitly superior in many ways. 

The whole of the history of the [[First Age]] is strongly affected by the desire of many different characters to possess the [[Silmarils]], which contain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees.

In the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor, whose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic significance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question, and also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the [[Dúnedain]] and the Elves.

The pair of the trees was perhaps referred to as '''Aldu''' in [[Quenya]], the dual form of ''[[alda]]''. The word as such appears in the names of the weekday name [[Aldúya]] ("Day of the Two Trees") and [[Aldudénië]] ("Lament for the Trees").<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
The concept of the Two Trees is present since the earliest writings of the Legendarium, as in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In that continuity, the Elves maintained a prophecy concerning their rekindling and return to [[Luthany]] in historical times. In the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] the Elves toasted "to the rekindling of the Magic Sun" which [[Christopher Tolkien]] interprets as an expectation of the future event.<ref>{{LTII|VI}}</ref>

In Tolkien's latest writings in which Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Two Trees held the light of the untainted Sun rather than the light of the Two Lamps, which in this history never existed. They still lit the darkened world during the Years of the Trees, though in this history the darkness came from Melkor's sorceries rather than the absence of a Sun or Moon.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}, p. 375 - 385 </ref>

==Inspiration==
[[Michael Martinez]] has noted a similarity to [[Wikipedia:Persian mythology|Persian mythology]], where: 

"''there is a legend of two cypress trees, the Trees of the Sun and Moon, that are said to have been planted by Zoroaster himself. Alexander the Great, hearing of these trees, visited them when he conquered Persia. He asked the oracle of the trees what his future would be. The oracle told him that he would go on to conquer India but that he would then die soon afterward. In some versions of the legend the trees themselves speak to Alexander. According to Marco Polo, the Khalif Motawakkil had one of the trees cut down in the 9th Century CE (when the tree was said to be 1450 years old) and sent to Baghdad. The Khalif was subsequently murdered by his own guards (Cf. The Book of Ser by Marco Polo, the Venetian).''"

While Martinez acknowledges that there is no "''direct connection between J.R.R. Tolkien and Marco Polo''", he speculates that Tolkien possibly was familiar with the writings of [[Wikipedia:Marco Polo|Marco Polo]]. Tolkien himself visited Venice many times, which he identified with Gondor - where supposedly the Tale of Two Trees was preserved.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/11/29/is-there-a-source-for-the-tale-of-the-two-trees/|articlename=Is There a Source for the Tale of the Two Trees?|dated=29 November 2011|website=[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/ Middle-earth.Xenite.org]|accessed=31 December 2011}}</ref>

[[Clyde S. Kilby]] has suggested that the concept of the Two Trees shows an influence from the Biblical description of the creation of the world ("Let there be Light!"): 

"''The Two Trees in The Silmarillion are at first the source of light. After the desctruction of the Two Trees there is a long period of twilight in Middle-earth and it is during this time that first Elves and then Dwarves awaken. It is only long afterwards, with the rising of sun and moon, that Men awaken.''"<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], ''[[Tolkien and the Silmarillion]]'', "Tolkien as Christian Writer", pp. 59-60</ref>
