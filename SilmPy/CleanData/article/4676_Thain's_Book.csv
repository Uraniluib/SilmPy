The '''Thain's Book''' was a copy of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] made in [[the Shire]] and later augmented with additions made in [[Minas Tirith]].

==History==
The contents of the Thain's Book had various authors. The oldest material came from the diary of [[Bilbo Baggins]], which he took with him to [[Rivendell]]<ref name="Records">{{FR|Records}}</ref> after {{TA|3001}}. In {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]] brought Bilbo's writings with him back to the Shire, and between {{TA|3020|n}} and {{TA|3021|n}} he added account of the [[War of the Ring]]. All of this material was contained in four large red leather volumes; in [[Westmarch]] a fifth volume of commentaries, genealogies, and other [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] matters were added.  At this point these writings were referred to as the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].

The actual Thain's Book was a copy of the Red Book that was produced in [[Gondor]]. [[Thain]] [[Peregrin Took]] retired to Gondor in {{FoA|63}} and took with him a copy of the Red Book as requested by King [[Aragorn|Elessar]]. In [[Minas Tirith]] this book received many annotations and corrections (particularly of Elvish names, words, and quotations). It was also enhanced with an abbreviated  version of "[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]", written by [[Barahir (grandson of Faramir)|Barahir]], the grandson of [[Faramir]]. In {{FoA|172}} the [[King's Writer]], [[Findegil]], made an exact copy of the book in Minas Tirith, which was returned to the Shire at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin and kept in the [[Great Smials]].  The copy written by Findegil was of special interest in that it alone preserved Bilbo's "[[Translations from the Elvish]]", written between {{TA|3003}} and {{TA|3018|n}} that used sources available in Rivendell.<ref name="Records"/>
