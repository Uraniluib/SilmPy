The '''Great Gates''' was the original entrance to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], entering from [[Dimrill Dale]] into the rock. 

It was inscribed with [[cirth|runic]] spells of prohibition and exclusion in [[Khuzdul]]. Over time commands were added that all should depart who did not have the leave of the Lord of Moria, written in [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], the [[Common Speech]], [[Rohan language]], [[Dalian]], and [[Dunlendish]].<ref name="Dwarves"/><ref group=note>It is not clear why Dunlendish is used, since the [[Dunendings]] live in the other side of the Misty Mountains.<</ref>

==History==
[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Steamey - ''Azog and Nár'']]
When first built near [[Mirrormere]], where [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] saw his vision, the Gate was awe-inspiring. It remained the main (and perhaps) only entry to his Kingdom.

During the [[Second Age]], the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] built a second entrance to Khazad-dûm, the [[Doors of Durin]], at the western side of the [[Misty Mountains]] so as to facilitate access to [[Eriador]] and contact with the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]].

In {{TA|2790}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thrór]] and his companion [[Nár]] went to [[Moria]] to see the ancient halls of their ancestors. Despite the warnings of Nár, Thrór went through the Great Gates. He was captured by Orcs under the command of [[Azog]], who beheaded him. Azog wrote his own name in [[Angerthas Moria|Dwarvish runes]] on Thrór's head and threw it outside the gate for Nár to retrieve. He let Nár go to tell all the [[Dwarves]] that an [[Orcs|Orc]] ruled [[Moria]] now, and so Nár did, which started the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

In {{TA|2799|n}}, the War came to its climax with the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]],<ref name="TA"/> which was the largest battle of the war. During this battle the doors of the Gate were destroyed.<ref name="Dwarves"/> After the battle [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]], the victor, would not allow his people to reclaim it, for he had looked through the open Gate, and knew that the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] lurked there still.<ref name="Durin"/>

When [[Balin's Colony]] was attacked in {{TA|2994|n}}, it was heavily damaged.<ref name="Bridge">{{FR|II5}}</ref>

On [[15 January]], {{TA|3019|n}}, the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], after the loss of [[Gandalf]], exited Moria through its eastern access, still broken.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> It was not heavily guarded.<ref name="Bridge"/> Prior to that, both Gandalf and [[Aragorn]] had passed through it.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
