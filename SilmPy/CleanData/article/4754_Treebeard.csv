'''Treebeard''', also known as '''Fangorn''', was the oldest of the [[Ents]], a tree-like being who was a sort of "shepherd of trees". Very tall and stiff-limbed, with bark-like skin and leafy hair, like most Ents, Treebeard took a long time to make up his mind. He repeatedly spoke of not "being hasty". 

Treebeard is described along with [[Tom Bombadil]] as the [[eldest|oldest being]] in Middle-earth. By the later [[Third Age]], he lived in [[Fangorn Forest]], which was named after him (or he after it).

==History==
[[File:Luca Bonatti - Farewell to Fangorn.jpg|left|thumb|[[Luca Bonatti]] - ''Farewell to Fangorn'']]
Treebeard was the [[eldest]] person of [[Middle-earth]], obviously being created along with the Ents during the [[Years of the Trees]], before the creation of the [[stars]]; although he said that there were trees in Fangorn that were "older than he". His realm was the immense forest that spanned from [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]] to [[Calenardhon]] and saw it destroyed and diminishing by the centuries. From the [[Elder Days]], Treebeard had memories of the [[Willows|willow]]-meads of [[Tasarinan]], the [[Elms|elm]]-woods of [[Ossiriand]], the [[Pines|pine]]-trees of [[Dorthonion]] and the [[beeches]] of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}, Treebeard's Song</ref> 

He was with his beloved [[Fimbrethil]], but as with all of the other [[Entwives]], she left for the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]], and had been missing ever since, especially after [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed those lands in the [[Second Age]]. 

The forests of the Ents diminished and [[Fangorn Forest]] was one of their remnants, where Treebeard and other Ents retreated. There he kept his [[Ent-houses]] one of which was the [[Wellinghall]] in the flanks of [[Methedras]].<ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|III4}}</ref> 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Wellinghall'']]
During the [[War of the Ring]], in [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}} he discovered [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] ("Merry") and [[Peregrin Took]] ("Pippin") after they escaped from [[Orcs]]. He welcomed them to the [[Wellinghall]]. The hobbits brought news of the Wizard Saruman's treachery and his Orcs damaging the trees, but Treebeard already knew of these disasters.

The Ents—usually a very patient, deliberate people—did become angry at Saruman, whose armies were cutting down large numbers of their trees. Treebeard convened an [[Entmoot]], a meeting of the Ents at [[Derndingle]].<ref name="Treebeard"/>

After lengthy deliberation Treebeard led them marching on Saruman's fortress at Isengard in [[March 3]], accompanied by the two Hobbits: the last march of the Ents. In the [[Battle of Isengard]] they destroyed the valley and trapped Saruman in the tower of Orthanc. Treebeard appointed the two Hobbits door-wardens of Orthanc. There Treebeard also saw [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] who brought a message for Saruman, and caught him and captured him inside Orthanc.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

[[5 March|Two days later]] they were soon joined by a company of [[Rohirrim]] with [[Gandalf]], returning victorious from the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After deposing Saruman, Gandalf asked Treebeard to pour back the water into Orthanc so that Saruman can never escape. Treebeard declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the "Watchwood".<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

The following months the Ents destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]], filling it with trees; Treebeard saw the flight of many Orcs who met their doom in the forest. He kept their prisoner informed, who would come to the window of Orthanc to listen. 

Eventually the Wizard withered away and eventually managed to make the Ents pity him, and on [[August 15]] they let them leave Isengard. However, before he left, Treebeard made him lock the tower and hand over the [[key of Orthanc]]. [[August 22|A week later]] Treebeard welcomed [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company at Orthanc, and related these news.

Presumably Treebeard stayed for some time in the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]], which King Elessar declared an Entish realm.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Treebeard is the direct translation of the [[Sindarin]] name ''Fangorn'' (from ''[[fang]]'' = "beard" and ''[[orn]]'' = "tree").

== Inspiration ==
Treebeard's booming voice was inspired by the way [[C.S. Lewis]] spoke.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, " 'The New Hobbit' ", p. 258</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Treebeard.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Treebeard in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]]]
'''1978: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:[[John Westbrook]] provides the voice of Treebeard. His actions in the overthrow of Isengard are not mentioned: he merely brings Merry and Pippin to Gandalf.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Stephen Thorne]] provided the voice of Treebeard.  Thorne also sings the songs of 'The Lore of Living Creatures' and 2 verses of the 'Song of the Ents and the Entwives.' His participation in the destruction of Isengard is fully documented, but he is the only Ent given a voice in the production.  He also appears in the penultimate episode when the company pass through Isengard on their return.  As in the book, he reveals to Gandalf Saruman's departure from Orthanc.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Treebeard.jpeg|thumb|240px|right|''Treebeard'' in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]]]
'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by [[John Rhys-Davies]], who also plays [[Gimli]].

:The Ents at the [[Entmoot]] initially decline Merry and Pippin's request for help. Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards [[Isengard]], claiming that it is the last place [[Saruman]] would look for them because it puts them so close to danger. Treebeard is initially confused, but ultimately succumbs to Pippin's request. When Treebeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents. They attack Isengard and manage to flood it.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Treebeard, fully CGI, makes some last appearances at Isengard.
