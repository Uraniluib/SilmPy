'''Ogres''' were monstrous and destructive creatures of legend and folklore of [[Middle-earth]], although it can not be said if they indeed existed.

During the [[Riddle-game]] with [[Gollum]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] in his attempt to solve Gollum's fifth riddle, he sat thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales.<Ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>.

No ogre is ever mentioned in the annals of the [[Elder Days]] and none played any role in the wars and battles. It is entirely possible that they were a mythical race. 

It is also possible that Ogre were just another name for the [[Trolls]].<ref name=HMN/>
==Etymology==
''[[Wiktionary:ogre#English|Ogre]]'' derives, through French, from the Greco-Latin name Orcus. It is interesting to note that Orcus is supposedly the origin also for the [[Old English]] word ''[[Orc]]'', although [[Tolkien]] doubted that etymology.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Gene Wolfe]]" (letter)</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
''Ogres'' were used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in early drafts of the [[legendarium]] as a name for one of the monsters bred by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] along with [[Gongs]] and the other [[úvanimo|Úvanimor]].<ref>{{HM|LT1}}</ref>

They are mentioned as cannibal [[giants]]. Those of the north were known as ''Hongwir'' while the southern ones were named ''Sarqindi''.<ref>{{PE|14}}, "The Creatures of the Earth", p. 9</ref> ''Sarqindi'' is glossed as "Cannibal-ogres",<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 347</ref> and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] and [[Christopher Gilson]] have suggested that ''hongwir'' might be related to the [[Qenya]] word ''ongwe'' (meaning "pain").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 6</ref>

Tolkien mentioned again ogres out of context in analyses of the name ''[[Orcs|Orc]]'': "...the gloss ''Þyrs'' 'ogre'..." , and of the name ''[[Ettendales]]'': "This is meant to be a Common Speech (not Elvish) name, though it contains an obsolete element ''eten'' 'troll, ogre'."<ref name=HMN>{{HM|N}}, pp. 762, 770</ref>

==Inspiration==
In his childhood, Tolkien and his brother [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] gave a miller and a farmer, who frightened the boys and lived near the [[Sarehole Mill]] in the Moseley area of [[Birmingham]], the nicknames "White Ogre" and "Black Ogre", respectively.<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''</ref> These characters also appear in stories written by Hilary Tolkien.<ref>[[Hilary Tolkien]]; [[Angela Gardner]] (ed), ''[[Black & White Ogre Country|Black & White Ogre Country: The Lost Tales of Hilary Tolkien]]''</ref>

Tolkien enjoyed reading E.A. Wyke-Smith's ''[[The Marvellous Land of Snergs]]'' ([[1927]]) to his children. The book recounts the adventures of two children and a Snerg ("a race of people only slightly taller than the average table"), and their tale include meeting the vegetarian ogre Golithos.<ref>[[Douglas A. Anderson]] (ed.), ''[[Tales Before Tolkien|Tales Before Tolkien: The Roots of Modern Fantasy]]'', pp. 359-60</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
