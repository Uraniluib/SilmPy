The '''Kings of Durin's Folk''' were those of the [[House of Durin]] who ruled as kings, even when in exile.  

The kings were all descended from [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] of the [[First Age]]; in fact, five of the kings after Durin I were held to be reincarnations of him by the [[Dwarves]].  No complete list of all kings is known. The table below shows the names of those Kings who have been recorded, or whose existence could be deduced.  In the table all information was obtained from ''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix A, "Durin’s Folk"<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> unless otherwise indicated.  The "Realm(s)" column indicates which place or places the kings ruled from during their reigns.

After Smaug's death, Thorin was slain in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. The only remaining descendants of Thrór's line, Thorin's nephews [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]], were also lost in the battle.

His realm became a close ally of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]].

He led Durin's Folk back to recolonize [[Khazad-dûm]] (Moria) at some (unspecified) time after the beginning of the Fourth Age, where they remained "until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended".<ref>''The Peoples of Middle-earth'': "The Making of Appendix A", '(iv) Durin's Folk', p. 278.</ref></td></tr>

Durin I died before the end of the First Age, so that between his rule and that of Thorin III, the Kings of Durin's line ruled for a period of about 6,500 years. Given that the average length of a reign among the Longbeards seems to have been roughly a century, it can be deduced that there were probably about fifty Kings that have went unmentioned.
