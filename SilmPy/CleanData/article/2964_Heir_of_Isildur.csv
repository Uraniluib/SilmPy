'''Heir of Isildur''' was the title of thirty-nine lords of the [[Dúnedain]] descended in right line from [[Isildur]] the son of [[Elendil]], from his son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] to [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]],<ref>{{App|North}}</ref> who [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited the Kingdoms]] of the Dúnedain in [[Middle-earth]].

[[Isildur]] was the eldest son of [[Elendil]], and so by right he and his heirs should have inherited the title of [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] and ruled the [[Reunited Kingdom|Two Kingdoms]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. Soon after the defeat of [[Sauron]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], though, Isildur and his three elder sons all perished in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

Isildur's only remaining Heir was [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], kept safe in [[Rivendell]] but only eleven years old at that time, and unable to take up his rule. So, Isildur's nephew [[Meneldil]] took control of the kingdom of Gondor, and the Two Kingdoms split from one another. In the south, Gondor remained strong under the rule of Meneldil's descendants, but the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] was not so fortunate. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and was slowly overcome by dark forces of the neighbouring land of [[Angmar]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> 

[[Arvedui]], Isildur's Heir through twenty-three generations, was the last King to rule in the north; he was also notable for marrying [[Fíriel]], daughter of the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]] [[Ondoher]], thus uniting the [[House of Isildur]] and [[House of Anárion]]. He later attempted to reclaim the [[High King of the Dúnedain|High Kingship]], but failed,<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> and the last remnant of royal Arnor was overrun by its enemies.

Though their royal cities were wasted, and their people dwindled, the line of Isildur's Heirs continued for another sixteen generations under the title '[[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]', who were Arvedui's descendants and ruled the remnants of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]. When the line of the Kings of Gondor also failed and the [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards]] ruled the Kingdom, it was the Chieftains who held the line of Anárion alive, but they were hidden in the north, forgotten by nearly all.

The last Chieftain was [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] of the [[War of the Ring]], who famously came to [[Minas Tirith]] and reclaimed the High Kingship of all the western lands as the [[Reunited Kingdom]].<ref name="Eriador"/>
