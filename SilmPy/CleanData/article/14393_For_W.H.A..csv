'''For W.H.A.''' is a poem written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in parallel [[Old English|Old]] and Modern English. The poem is a "tardy tribute and token of thanks" to [[W.H. Auden]], on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday and to mirror Auden's "[[A Short Ode to a Philologist]]" published in ''[[English and Medieval Studies Presented to J.R.R. Tolkien on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday]]'' (George Allen & Unwin, 1962).

"For W.H.A." was first published in [[1967]] within ''[[Shenandoah: A Tribute to Wystan Hugh Auden on his Sixtieth Birthday|Shenandoah: The Washington and Lee University Review Vol. 18 No. 2]]''.

Tolkien signed off the poem using an [[Old English]] form of his name, "Raegnold Hraedmoding".
