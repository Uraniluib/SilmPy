The '''Hunting of the Wolf''' is the confrontation between [[Iathrim]] and [[Carcharoth]], forming the final adventure of the [[Quest of the Silmaril]].

At the gates of [[Angband]], the mighty wolf [[Carcharoth]] had bitten [[Beren]]'s hand from his wrist, and with it the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] it held. The Silmaril was a hallowed jewel, and burned the innards of the evil monster. In searing pain, the wolf blindly chased through [[Beleriand]] and, breaking the [[Girdle of Melian]], roamed madly through the lands of [[Doriath]].

King [[Thingol]] set out to hunt the wolf with the greatest of his warriors. With him went [[Mablung|Mablung of the Heavy Hand]] and [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]], and Beren Erchamion, and [[Huan]] the Hound of Valinor. They found Carcharoth under the eaves of [[Neldoreth]], drinking beneath a waterfall of the River [[Esgalduin]]. Eventually, after a mighty battle, Huan slew Carcharoth, but both he and Beren were mortally wounded.

From the wolf's belly, Thingol recovered the Silmaril and carried it back to [[Menegroth]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> This was the same jewel that he fastened in the [[Nauglamir]],<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> which [[Eärendil]] would bear as he sailed to [[Aman]] and that, according to legend, became the [[Star of Earendil|Evening and the Morning Star]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>
