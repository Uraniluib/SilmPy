{{Pronounce|Aule.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Aulë''' ([[Quenya]], pronounced {{IPA|[ˈa͡ʊle]}}) was a [[Valar|Vala]] and one of the [[Aratar]], also known as the ''the Smith'' and ''Smith of the Valar'', concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft. 
==Attributes==
Aulë governs the substances of the [[Ambar]] and he delights in all works and crafts all of which he is master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> 

He enjoyed his skill of devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like [[Melkor]], as [[Ilúvatar]] gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Aule was always faithful to Eru and submitted all his creations to His will. He was never jealous of others' creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed in the things he made and in the making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Melkor who envied him; Melkor always marred his work and Aule always sought to repair them.<ref name=vala/><ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref>

He was the third most powerful of the [[Aratar]]. He was husband to [[Yavanna]], with whom he [[Mansions of Aulë|dwelt]] in central [[Valinor]].

Several [[Maiar]] were associated with Aulë: [[Sauron|Mairon]], before being corrupted by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and becoming [[Sauron]]; and [[Saruman|Curumo]], who later went to [[Middle-earth]] as an [[Istar]] to combat [[Sauron]].

==History==
In the [[Song of the Ainur]] Aule thought most of the fabric of the Earth.<ref name=ai/> During the creation of [[Arda]], Aulë worked much with [[Manwe]] and [[Ulmo]];<ref name=ai/> Aule fashioned the substances that composed [[Ambar]], and was most involved in building the continents and mountains. As he was much like Melkor, there was strife between them and he grew weary repairing the tumults and disorders caused by Melkor on his work.<ref name=vala/> One of his [[Maiar]], [[Mairon]], would be ensnared by his enemy in those early strifes.<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

When [[Osse]] was also seduced by Melkor, Aule pleaded to [[Uinen]] to calm and restrain him, and so the Maia returned to his master Ulmo.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

He constructed [[Angainor]], the chain of [[Morgoth|Melkor]], the lamps [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]] and the vessels of the Sun and Moon. 

Aulë created his own race of beings, the [[Dwarves]], because he was unwilling to wait for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] to appear. [[Ilúvatar]] knew of this and even as Aulë was instructing them He chastened Aulë. Aulë humbly repented, offering his children to the will of Ilúvatar, whom He accepted as His adopted children. Since [[Ilúvatar]] had decided that the [[Elves]] were to be the first-born race, He made the Dwarves to sleep until the Elves [[Awakening of the Elves|woke]] on [[Arda]]. 

When the [[Elves]] came to [[Valinor]], the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] became the students of Aulë and his friends.<ref name=vala/> [[Fëanor]] was his greatest pupil, and from him learned the craft to make the [[Silmarils]].

==Names and etymology==
''Aulë'' apparently means "invention" in [[Quenya]] (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈa͡ʊle]}}) from [[root]] [[GAWA]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 358 (form: ''Aule'')</ref>

The name is also said to derive from [[Valarin]] '''''Aȝūlēz'''''.<Ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

In [[Sindarin]], his name is '''''Óli''''' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈoːli]}}) or '''''Ôl''''' ({{IPA|[oːːl]}}). 

In [[Khuzdul]], his name is '''''Mahal''''' ("[[The Maker]]", pron. {{IPA|[mahal]}}).<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Aule is referred to as ''Craeftfrea'' "Craft-ruler".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
