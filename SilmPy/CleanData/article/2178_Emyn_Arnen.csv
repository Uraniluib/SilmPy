==History==

Old records preserved in [[Gondor]] indicate that ''Arnen'' was once used for the larger part of the region later known as Ithilien.<ref name=VT>{{VT|42a}}, p. 17</ref>

Emyn Arnen was home to a family of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] nobles, and from them came a [[Húrin of Emyn Arnen]], who became steward to King [[Minardil]] of [[Gondor]] and later founded the line of the [[House of Húrin]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

After the events of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Faramir]] son of Steward [[Denethor|Denethor II]] became [[Prince of Ithilien]], and made Emyn Arnen his home.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Emyn Arnen'' translates as "the hills of Arnen" (cf. ''[[amon|emyn]]''). One historian of Gondor claimed that ''Arnen'' was likely a word invented by the Númenórean settlers of Gondor, intended to resemble an Elvish tongue (but wrongly mixing [[Quenya]] ''[[ar|ar-]]'' "beside" with [[Sindarin]] ''[[nen]]'' "water"). Other historians derived ''Arnen'' from an unattested [[pre-Númenórean]] word ''arn-'' ("rock"), although this was based on pure guessing.<ref name=VT/>
