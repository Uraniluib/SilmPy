__NOTOC__
'''''more''''' is a [[Quenya]] word meaning "dark(ness)".<ref name=L297>{{L|297}}</ref>

''more'' also perhaps has the same meaning in [[Telerin]]<ref name="HF">[[Helge Fauskanger]]'s [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/telerin.htm Telerin article] at [[Ardalambion]]: "The independent form of mori- was probably *more, as in Quenya (since final short -i became -e at the Common Eldarin stage), but no Telerin form as such is mentioned in the entry MOR in the Etymologies (LR:373)"</ref>.

It is seen as ''mori-'' in compounds (see etymology below).
