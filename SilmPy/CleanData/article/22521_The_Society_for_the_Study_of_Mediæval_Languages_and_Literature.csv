'''The Society for the Study of Mediæval Languages and Literature''' is a society that exists for the encouragement of reasearch in medieval languages and literature and for the publication of results of that research (usually in its journal, ''Medium Ævum''). Originally called the ''Arthurian Society'', it was based at the [[University of Oxford]]. During his tenure as Merton Professor of the English language, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] served as the president of the Society, and he was also on the editorial board of ''Medium Ævum'' (along with [[Wikipedia:Charles Talbut Onions|C.T. Onions]] and [[J.A.W. Bennett]]). [[Oxford]] printer [[Basil Blackwell]] served as the Society's treasurer for some time during the early 1950's, and all publications were printed at his facilities.

For the Society, Tolkien produced ''[[Sigelwara Land]]'' in two parts, one in [[1932]] and one in [[1935]].
