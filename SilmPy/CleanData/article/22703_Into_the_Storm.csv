<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Give it to me 
I must have it 
Precious treasure 
I deserve it 

'''[Bridge]:'''
Where can I run 
How can I hide 
The Silmarils 
Gems of treelight 
Their life belongs to me 
Oh it's sweet how the 
Darkness is floating around 

'''[Chorus]:'''
We are following 
The will of the one 
Through the dark age 
And into the storm 
And we are following 
The will of the one 
Through the dark age 
And into the storm 
Lord I'm mean 

Blackheart show me 
What you hold in hand 
I still hunger for more 
Release me 
From my pain 
Give it to me 
How I need it 
How I need it 
How I need it 

'''[Bridge]'''

'''[Chorus]'''

I did my part 
Now it's your turn 
And remember 
What you've promised
