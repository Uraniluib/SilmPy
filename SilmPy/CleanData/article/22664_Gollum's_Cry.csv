==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Weakest of moments are these 
The choking hold of insanity 
Loses its grip and cuts me so deep 
With the knife of clear memories 
Of that innocent past which didn't last 
Oh, no! No! 
The precious of mine 
For you I would die 
My love, my life, my everything 
For you I cry 

But not anymore 
The things will get better 
I will come to you 
And soon we'll be together 
Forever...
</poem>
