The '''Elves''' (''[[Quendi]]'') were the first of the races of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], known also as the [[Firstborn]] for that reason.  The Elves are distinguished from the other two races, the [[Men]] and the [[Dwarves]], especially by the fact of their near immortality.

==History==

===Awakening===
{{main|Awakening of the Elves}}

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Dawn of the Firstborn Elves.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Dawn of the Firstborn Elves'']] About the same time that [[Varda]], Queen of the [[Valier]], ended her labours in creating the [[Stars]], the Elves awoke beside the lake [[Cuiviénen]].  The first things they saw were the stars, and henceforth they adored them.  The first sound they heard was the flowing of water, and henceforth they loved water as well.

They made speech then, and called themselves the ''[[Quendi]]''.  [[Morgoth|Melkor]] was the first to be aware of them, and he caused evil spirits to go about among them.  When one or a small group wandered abroad, they would often vanish.  It is believed that Melkor may have created [[Orcs]] with the elves he captured.

[[Oromë]], the Huntsman of the [[Valar]], happened upon them when he heard their singing far-off.  He was amazed to see them, and called them the ''Eldar'', "People of the Stars".

===Sundering===
{{main|Sundering of the Elves}}

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Oromë espies the first Elves.jpg |thumb|right|250px|[[Anke Eißmann]] - ''Oromë espies the first Elves'']] Though at first the Quendi were afraid of Oromë, the noblest among them saw that he was no dark horseman, as the lies of Melkor claimed.  He had the light of [[Aman]] in his eyes and face, and they were drawn to him.

After spending a while among the Quendi, Oromë returned to [[Valinor]] and took council with the other Valar and Valier.  At the counsel of [[Ilúvatar]], [[Manwë]], King of the Valar, decided that they must go to war against Melkor to protect the Quendi from him.  After a great battle and [[Siege of Utumno]], which reshaped the earth itself, Melkor was bound and cast into the prison of [[Mandos]].  Then the Valar, pleased with the outcome, summoned the Elves to Valinor, seeking fellowship with them.

At Oromë's urging, many of the Elves (especially the kindreds of [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and [[Elwë]]) agreed.  But others, henceforth called the [[Avari]], declared that they preferred starlight and the wide spaces of [[Middle-earth]].  So the Elves were first sundered.  During the journey to [[Belegaer]], gradually the number of the Elves began to lessen as various groups dropped away.  Some of the [[Teleri]] (kindred of Elwë) refused to cross the [[Misty Mountains]], and settled in [[Anduin]] under the leadership of [[Lenwë]], to be called later the [[Nandor]].  Elwë then went missing, and in dismay the rest of the Teleri remained behind, while the [[Noldor]] (kindred of Finwë) and [[Vanyar]] (kindred of Ingwë) used an island as a ship, and found at last Aman and Valinor.

After several years, Oromë returned to search for the Teleri.  Some, under [[Olwë]], relented and followed.  Others remained to continue to search for Elwë.  Still others, under [[Círdan]], remained because in that time they had become devoted to [[Ossë]] and the Sea.  Those Teleri that chose to remain were called the [[Sindar]].  Elwë, who had fallen asleep due to his enchantment with [[Melian]], returned to claim lordship and establish them in [[Doriath]].  The Noldor and some of the Teleri, however, built the great cities of [[Tirion]] and [[Alqualondë]] (respectively) in Aman.  The Vanyar dwelt in [[Valmar]], for they were closest to the Valar of the kindreds.

===Exile of the Noldor===
{{main|Exile of the Noldor}}

[[File:Jenny Dolfen - The Coming of Fingolfin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jenny Dolfen]] - ''The Coming of Fingolfin'']] Melkor, having been released on the promise of good behavior, spread lies about the Valar among the Noldor.  [[Fëanor]], the eldest son of Finwë and one of the greatest Elves to have ever lived, hated Melkor more than all the other Noldor, but was paradoxically one of the most influenced by his lies.  He forged weapons, and his greatest works, the [[Silmarils]], captured the light of the [[Two Trees]] – and his own heart.  After Melkor stole the Silmarils and killed Finwë, Fëanor stirred the Noldor to open disobedience to the Valar.  In an epic journey filled with treachery, death, and deceit, the Noldor entered in to Exile, crossing over into [[Beleriand]].

===Battles of Beleriand===
{{main|Battles of Beleriand}}

There were five great battles fought in Beleriand.  The [[First Battle]] was the result of an attack by Melkor on Círdan and Elwë (now known as [[Thingol]]).  Though the Elves managed to resist the attack successfully, this left Melkor essentially with full reign of Beleriand.  Upon the sudden and unanticipated [[Return of the Noldor]], the tables were reversed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]].  The third battle (“[[Dagor Aglareb]]”) occurred when Melkor tried unsuccessfully to destroy the Elves, breaking forth from [[Angband]].  This only resulted in the vigilant [[Siege of Angband]].  Morgoth was more successful in the next battle, [[Dagor Bragollach]], which ended in the deaths of many Elven princes, among them [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]].  The siege was broken.  Several decades later, [[Maedhros]], eldest son of Fëanor, counterattacked in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].  Although at first very successful, the tide turned against the Elves, and ended in the destruction of [[Hithlum]].  It was not half a century later that [[Gondolin]], the last real stronghold of the Noldor, was [[Fall of Gondolin|destroyed]].  [[Doriath]], the centre of the [[Sindar]]in realm, was sacked by [[Dwarves]].[[File:Ted Nasmith - Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Eärendil and The Battle of Eagles and Dragons'']]

===Salvation===
{{main|War of Wrath}}

With the near destruction of the Elves, the last survivors were at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] and [[Isle of Balar|Balar]] and were led by Gil-galad and Círdan. Among them was [[Eärendil]], the son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]].  Eärendil made a miraculous voyage to [[Valinor]] to beg the pardon of the Valar.  His request was granted.  The Valar came across the Sea to [[Middle-earth]], and in the [[War of Wrath]] thrust Morgoth into the [[Void]] and purged Beleriand.  They offered to let the Elves return with them to Valinor; some accepted, but many others, under [[Gil-galad]], chose to remain.

===Decline===

[[File:Angus McBride - Celebrimbor.gif|thumb|right|150px|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Celebrimbor'']] Though Morgoth was gone to trouble the world no longer, [[Sauron]], his greatest servant, was still there, and he made war on the remaining Elves who chose not to depart Middle-earth throughout the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.  

During this time the Elves realized how [[Men]] were rising to take their place, and Sauron exploited their longing. [[Annatar]] corrupted [[Celebrimbor]], the grandson of Fëanor, to make the [[Rings of Power]], especially the [[Three Rings]] to preserve the Elves. Annatar was a guise of Sauron who also forged a ring – [[the One Ring]]. However the Elves realised the deception and defied Sauron, who then [[War of the Elves and Sauron|waged War against them]]. In the following centuries Elves continued to heed the invitation of the Valar, desire the Sea and depart for the Undying Lands. Realms such as [[Dol Amroth]] were deserted and gave their place to Men.

It was not until the end of the Third Age that the One Ring was destroyed, marring the Three Rings at the same time.  In the years that followed the last of the Elves departed across the Sea to Valinor, their mission against Sauron complete, never to return.

Well into the [[Fourth Age]] and the [[Dominion of Men]], most Elves apparently had left the [[Westlands]], with most populations remaining at least in [[Mirkwood]] and [[Lindon]]. [[Rivendell]] and [[Lothlórien]] appeared mostly abandoned around the time of [[King Elessar]]'s and [[Arwen]]'s death.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

The Elves eventually faded, as their spirits overwhelmed and consumed their bodies. At the end of the world, all Elves will have become invisible to mortal eyes, known as [[Lingerers]], except to those to whom they wish to manifest themselves.<ref>{{MR|Laws}}</ref> [[Ilúvatar]] had not revealed the role of the Elves after [[the End]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>

==Life and customs==
:''Main articles: ''[[Elven characteristics]], [[Elven life cycle]], and [[Elven customs]]''

Besides being considered more beautiful than men, Elves were also generally taller.  Their hair colour varied; but the basic rules were that the [[Noldor]] generally had dark hair (brown or black), the [[Vanyar]] golden, and the [[Teleri]] silver or dark.  Their eyes are usually described as grey. 

Their lives were counted to begin at conception rather than birth, and though their minds sharpened much earlier in life than in the race of Men, their bodies grew more slowly.  They were considered fully-grown at about a century.  They married usually only once in their lives, and their children were often few and far-between.

Their most distinguishing characteristic from the [[Mortals|Mortal]] races was the fact that they were invulnerable to age or disease; unless they were killed by sword or sorrow, they would live to the end of the world. Unlike Men whose [[fëar]] (spirits) left Arda when their bodies died, Elves' fëar were bound to Arda until its ending. If an Elf's hröa (body) died, its fëa would be summoned to the [[Halls of Mandos]], where the Valar could re-embody the Elf in a hröa that was identical to the Elf's previous hröa. However, if an Elf committed evil acts during their lifetime and refused to repent, the Valar could delay the Elf's re-embodiment, impose conditions on it, or refuse it altogether.<ref name=P4i>{{MR|P4i}}, p. 339</ref><ref>{{PM|Last}}, pp. 380, 389</ref> An Elf could refuse the summons to Mandos or choose to remain disembodied,<ref name=P4i></ref><ref>{{PM|XI2}}, p. 334</ref> but the Elf's houseless fëa would still be unable to leave Arda.

==Arts, crafts, powers and magic==

Other races often spoke of 'Elf magic', or of objects made by Elves as if they contained enchantments. It is unclear how accurate it is to call Elvish arts and crafts 'magic' or 'enchanted'. Elves themselves only used these words when attempting to simplify or clarify how elvish-made things seemed to have a special quality that no other races were able to achieve. Powerful Elves seemed to have control over nature and the elements, their clothes seemed to shine with their own light, their blades seemed to never lose their sharpness. Less educated folks could not explain these effects, so they simply called them 'magic'.

==Languages==
{{main|Elvish}}

[[File:Donato Giancola - Lore.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Donato Giancola]] - ''Lore'']] Because [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] developed the Elves almost for his languages, those he developed are of special interest to many Tolkien scholars.  His primary languages are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], but these have many variants and dialects as is seen in the table below.  They were generally written in the [[Cirth]] and [[Tengwar]] scripts.

==Inspiration==
===Germanic influence===
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', a diminutive fairy-like race of elves had once been a great and mighty people who had "diminished" as Men took over the world.<ref name="bolt1" /><ref>{{HM|LT2}}</ref><ref name="Fimi">[[Dimitra Fimi]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_117/ai_n16676591 "Mad" Elves and "elusive beauty": some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology] in ''Folklore'', vol. 117, iss. 2, August 2006, pp. 156–170</ref> They were influenced by the [[Wikipedia:Elf|Elves]] of Northern European mythologies, especially the god-like and human-sized ''[[Wikipedia:Light elf|Ljósálfar]]'' of Norse mythology,<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]''</ref> also appearing in medieval works such as ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'', the Welsh [[Pwyll Prince of Dyved|Mabinogion]], [[The Fall of Arthur|Arthurian romances]] and the legends of the [[Wikipedia:Tuatha Dé Danann|Tuatha Dé Danann]].<ref name="Anderson1">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Douglas A. Anderson]] (ed.), ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'', p. 120</ref> 

Terry Gunnell also claims that the relationship between beautiful ships and the Elves is reminiscent of Njörðr and Skíðblaðni, Freyr's ship.<ref name="Articles"/>

===Celtic influence===
Tolkien expressed a dislike in Celtic legends and denied that his legendarium is "Celtic",<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 26</ref> however it is believed that Celtic Mythology had a great influence on Tolkien's writings on Elves <ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', p. 222</ref><ref name="Articles">Terry Gunnell, "[http://www.hi.is/Apps/WebObjects/HI.woa/wa/dp?detail=1004509&name=nordals_en_greinar_og_erindi ''Tívar'' in a Timeless Land: Tolkien's Elves]" conference lecture delivered on 13 September 2002</ref> and some of the stories Tolkien wrote as their 'legends' are directly influenced by it.<ref name="Fimi"/>  For example, the [[Noldor]] are based on the Tuatha Dé Danann in the ''Lebor Gabála Érenn'', and their migratory nature comes from early Irish/Celtic history.<ref name="Fimi"/> John Garth has also referenced the Tuatha Dé Danann in suggesting Tolkien was essentially rewriting Irish fairy traditions.

Tolkien also retains the usage of the Celtic and popular term 'fairy' for the same creatures.<ref>[[Marjorie J. Burns]], ''Perilous Realms: Celtic and Norse in Tolkien's Middle-earth'', p. 22</ref> The Elves are also called fair folk (based on [[Welsh]] ''Tylwyth teg'' 'the beautiful kindred' = fairies)<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 757 cf. "Fair folk"</ref> although they are unrelated to fairies.

===Eschatology===
The larger Elves are also inspired by Tolkien's Christian theology — as representing the state of Men in Eden who have not yet "[[Wikipedia:Fall of Man|fallen]]" — similar to humans but fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature, freed from human limitations, immortal, with wills directly effective for the achievement of imagination and desire.<ref name="Carpenter"/>

===Fairies===
Traditional "Victorian" dancing [[fairies]] and elves appear in Tolkien's early poetry,<ref name = "bolt1">{{HM|LT1}}</ref> and have influence upon his later works<ref>[[Dimitra Fimi]], "[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/working_with_english/Fimi_31_05_06.pdf Come sing ye light fairy things tripping so gay: Victorian Fairies and the Early Work of J. R. R. Tolkien]". ''Working With English: Medieval and Modern Language, Literature and Drama''. Retrieved 11/01/08</ref> in part due to the influence of a production of J.M. Barrie's ''Peter Pan'' in [[Birmingham]] in 1910<ref name="Carpenter">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''</ref> and his familiarity with the work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson<ref name="Carpenter" /> whose work Tolkien had acquired in 1914.<ref name="bolt1" />

In ''The Book of Lost Tales'' Tolkien includes both the more serious 'medieval' type of elves such as [[Fëanor]] and [[Turgon]] alongside the frivolous, "Jacobean-era" type of elves such as the [[Solosimpi]] and [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]].<ref name="Anderson1" /> 

Tolkien also developed the idea of children visiting [[Valinor]] in their sleep. Elves would also visit and comfort chided or upset children at night. This theme was largely abandoned.<ref>{{LT1|I}}</ref>

However after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien repeatedly expressed his misgivings concerning the undesirable associations of the name "elf" like those of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', the Victorian notions of fairies or mischievous imps, the imaginations of Michael Drayton or the fanciful beings with butterfly wings. 

He proposed that in [[translations of The Lord of the Rings|translations]] the "oldest available form of the name" be used for more elevated notions of beings  "supposed to possess formidable magical powers in early Teutonic mythology" ([[OED]] viz. the [[Old English]] ''ælf'', from Proto-Germanic ''*albo-z''). Tolkien warned against associations to the debased English notion of ''elfin'' and suggested that Germans would not translate his Elves as ''Elf, elfen'', words which might retain the undesirable images.

He rather suggested words such as ''Alp, Alb'', historically the more normal form and true cognate of English ''elf''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 756, s.v. "Elven-smiths".</ref>
