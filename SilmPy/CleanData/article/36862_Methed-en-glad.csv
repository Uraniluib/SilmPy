'''Methed-en-glad''' was a stronghold that was established at the edge of the forest south of the [[Crossings of Taeglin]] during the brief existence of [[Dor-Cúarthol]], when [[Túrin]] and [[Beleg]] lived on [[Amon Rûdh]].  It was kept by previously leaderless [[Men]] and [[Elves]] who had been dispossessed through battle and defeat.  From the stronghold there was a view to the south to Amon Rûdh, to and from which signals could pass for tidings and commands.<ref>{{CH|8}}, pp. 144-145</ref><ref>{{UT|2o}}</ref>
