==Note==
In editions prior to the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]]'', the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]] lists the two events of {{TA|3019}} at [[14 February]]. Since it is clear from the narrative that the latter event occurred one day before departure on [[16 February]], this causes a problem in the chronology. [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] decided to fix the Tale of Years so that the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]-sequence happened on 15 February. The return to life of [[Gandalf]] was also moved to today, for reasons unclear.[[Category:Dates|046]][[fi:15. helmikuuta]]</noinclude>
