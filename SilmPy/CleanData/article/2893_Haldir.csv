'''Haldir''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Lothlórien]], probably a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]], and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. 

==History==
Haldir was one of the [[Galadhrim]]; unlike his brothers, [[Rúmil (elf of Lórien)|Rúmil]] and [[Orophin]], Haldir had traveled outside Lórien and knew [[Westron]]. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on ''[[Telain|flets]]'' in the trees. 

Haldir was accompanied by his brothers between [[15 February|15]] and [[16 February]], {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> when they encountered the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] who arrived in Lórien. His brothers interacted little with the Fellowship because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated [[Gimli]] rather poorly due to bad relations between Elves and Dwarves. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until [[Galadriel]] said he did not have to. 

He had heard of [[Aragorn]], but there is no indication that they had met before.<ref name="LL"/> Haldir became their guide to the city of [[Caras Galadhon]]. 

After [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Haldir led them to their Elven boats.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explained the name ''Haldir'' as [[Sindarin]] for "Hidden Hero", though this Haldir refers to the (later omitted) son of [[Orodreth]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', "[[The Etymologies]]", entry SKAL</ref>
