__NOTOC__
==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The official Tolkien calendar, containing new and classic artwork for The Hobbit by Oscar-winning artists Alan Lee and John Howe.<br/><br/>The Official Tolkien Calendar 2013 features 14 paintings by the acclaimed artists Alan Lee and John Howe, the two artists whose work has defined the look of Middle-earth over the last 25 years. This is their first-ever collaboration since the official Tolkien Calendar began publishing 40 years ago. Each month depicts one of the story’s most famous scenes, including Bilbo outside Bag End, Smaug the Dragon, the Great Goblin, and Bilbo’s Front Hall. As well as classic illustrations from both artists’ celebrated portfolios, the 2013 calendar includes brand new paintings, created by John Howe and Alan Lee exclusively for this calendar.<br/><br/>The official Tolkien calendar has become an established publishing event, eagerly anticipated by Tolkien fans the world over. Previous Tolkien calendars have become much sought after collector’s items, and in the year of the 75th anniversary of the book and Peter Jackson’s film adaptation of The Hobbit, this year’s will be an essential purchase for Hobbit fans everywhere.}}
