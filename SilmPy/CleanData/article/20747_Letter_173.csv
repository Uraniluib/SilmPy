==Summary==
Tolkien told of the publishing of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' on [[20 October|October 20]] and the O'Donnell lecture on [[21 October|October 21]]. Tolkien was well pleased with the reception, but did not think it would cause a new trend in literature.<ref>We can now safely say he did...</ref> He was pleased with the published ''The Return of the King'', but felt it incomplete if there was nothing on [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] and [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]].<ref>He was probably referring to ''[[The Epilogue]]'', as published in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]''. It was going to be included, but was considered too anti-climactic.</ref>
