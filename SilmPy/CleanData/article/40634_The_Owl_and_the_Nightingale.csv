'''''The Owl and the Nightingale''''' is a [[Middle English]] poem. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] began a translation of the poem, which has never reached publication.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 771</ref> In a [[Letter to John Leyerle|letter from 1967]], Tolkien wrote:

{{Blockquote|I have at present given up the task [of translating The Owl and the Nightingale]. It comes off well enough in certain passages, but in general octo-syllabic couplets are defeating for a translator; there is no room to move.}}

In a letter written on [[8 April]] [[1932]], [[C.S. Lewis]] suggests his brother [[Warren Lewis|Warren]] to read Tolkien's translation of ''The Owl and the Nightingale''.<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]] (2004), ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2, p. 75</ref> It seems therefore likely that Tolkien had completed a translation of the poem by this date.<ref name=Addenda>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]], [[Wayne G.
