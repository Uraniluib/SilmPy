{{Pronounce|Eonwe.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Eönwë''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈonwe]}}) was the banner-bearer and herald of [[Manwë]], and Chief of the [[Maiar]] along with [[Ilmarë]]. Eönwë was the best with weapons in all [[Arda]], though not necessarily the most powerful.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>

When [[Eärendil]] reached the shores of [[Aman]], it was Eönwë who first greeted him and summoned him to come before the Powers of [[Arda]].  When [[Manwë]] decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to Middle-earth to fight the [[War of Wrath]], leading the [[Vanyar]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

When [[Morgoth]] was defeated Eönwë played a key role in the aftermath. He took the two remaining [[Silmarils]] and held them for safekeeping, but when the two remaining [[Sons of Fëanor]] stole them and fled, Eönwë did not allow them to be slain.<ref name="Earendil"/> [[Sauron]] paid obeisance to Eönwë and abjured all of his evil deeds.  But because Eönwë had not the power to pardon Sauron, he commanded him to return to [[Aman]] to receive Manwë's judgement.  Unwilling to receive humiliation and sentencing, when Eönwë left Sauron hid in [[Middle-earth]] and fell back into evil.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

At the dawn of the [[Second Age]], Eönwë came among the three faithful houses of [[Edain]] and taught them many things, blessing them with wisdom and power and longer [[mortality|life-spans]]. These became the [[High Men]] of [[Númenor]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>  
==Etymology==
The name Eönwë is [[Quenya]] in form<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry 'Eonwe'</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma|authorname=[[Helge Fauskanger]]}}</ref> however the ancient [[Loremasters]] knew no [[Elvish]] etymology of the name, suggesting that it is probably of [[Valarin]] origin.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}; note that the original text discusses the character's earlier name, "Fionwe", which [[Christopher Tolkien]] considers a mistake.</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/Valarin.htm|articlename=Valarin|authorname=[[Helge Fauskanger]]}}</ref>

===Earlier names===
In earlier works, such as ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]'', his name is '''Fiönwë''' which translates to "Son", from [[Qenya]] ''[[fion]]''.<ref name=LT>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref> This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë. 

His other early name, '''Urion''', means "He of the [[Sun]]", from ''[[ur]]'' ("the Sun"), ''uru'' ("fire") or ''urin'' ("blazing"),<ref name=LT/> and the masculine suffix ''[[-ion]]''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë was envisioned as the son of Manwë, but as the concept of the [[Valarindi]] (Children of the Valar) was abandoned, he was turned into Manwë's herald instead. <ref>{{LT1 | II}}, p.58</ref> In some versions Eönwë is the one who will kill Morgoth for his love for [[Arien]] (previously named Urwendi), instead of Turin.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 219</ref>
