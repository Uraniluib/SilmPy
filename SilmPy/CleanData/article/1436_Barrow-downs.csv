The '''Barrow-downs''' or '''''Tyrn Gorthad''''' were a series of low hills east of [[the Shire]], behind the [[Old Forest]], and southwest of the village of [[Bree]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Many of the hills were crowned with megaliths and [[barrows]], hence their name.

==History==
The Barrow-downs were first inhabited by [[Men]] related to the [[Edain]] in the [[First Age]],<ref>{{UT|Index}}, ''Barrow-downs''</ref> together with the [[Hills of Evendim]] to the north. They fled east as [[Easterlings]] invaded [[Eriador]] and passed on to [[Beleriand]], but after these had left or been killed in the [[War of Wrath]] the Edain returned to their old homes.

During the [[Second Age]] they were fairly numerous, and when they met with the [[Númenóreans]] the Barrow-downs were the first places where the [[Dúnedain]] émigrés from [[Númenor]] settled.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> When [[Elendil]] returned to [[Middle-earth]], the Barrow-downs were incorporated into the kingdom of [[Arnor]]. The Downs were revered because of the Great Barrows by the [[Arnorians]], and buried their lords and Kings there.<ref name=eriador/>

After the split of Arnor in {{TA|861}} the Barrow-downs became the capital of [[Cardolan]]. After [[Rhudaur]] fell to [[Angmar]] in {{TA|1409|n}}, the Dúnedain of Cardolan entrenched themselves here, but eventually the realm fell.  Around {{TA|1636}}<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}</ref> the [[Witch-king]] sent the [[Barrow-wights]] that haunted the hills,<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> preventing any resettlement; after [[Arthedain]] once again claimed the kingship over all of Arnor the Dúnedain tried to recolonize Cardolan, but this failed because of the Barrow-wights.

When the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] came north in their hunt for [[the One Ring]], the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] stayed in the Barrow-downs for a few days, rousing the Barrow-wights.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>  On [[28 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]] and company were trapped in the downs by a wight, probably in the same [[uncommon words|cairn]] which held the grave of the last prince of [[Cardolan]]. They were rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], and there got their [[Daggers_of_Westernesse|swords]].<ref>{{FR|I8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In topography, a "down" is a low-lying hill, from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''dún'' meaning "hill".<ref name="ASD">Joseph Bosworth and T. Northcote Toller, "[http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/008106 DÚN]" at ''An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (accessed 12 October 2010)</ref> In the [[wikipedia:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], a [[wikipedia:Downland|down]] is a gently-rolling chalk hill in Southern [[wikipedia:England|England]] (seen especially in the [[wikipedia:North Downs|North]] and [[wikipedia:South Downs|South Downs]]).<ref name="OD">[http://oxforddictionaries.com/ Oxford Dictionaries], "[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0241750?rskey=YT9je8&result=4#m_en_gb0241750 down]" (accessed 12 October 2010)</ref>

A "barrow" (or "berrow"; from English beorg, berg, 'hill, mound') not to be confused with the wheeled vehicle, is a tumulus or other prehistoric grave-mound.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 766</ref>

The name therefore would represent an earlier [[Old English]] form ''Beorga Dune'' "downs of barrows".<ref name=etym>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>

'''''Tyrn Gorthad''''' was the [[Sindarin]] name of the Barrow-downs. ''Tyrn Gorthad'' is a compound of  ''[[torn]]'' ("down") and ''[[gorthad]]'' ("of buried").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 116</ref> In one manuscript, the name ''Tyrn Goerthaid'' was used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].<ref>{{PM|VII}}</ref> ''Goerthaid'' seems to be the [[Sindarin#Plural|plural]] of ''gorthad'' with [[affection|affected]] vowels.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Hobbits' passage through the Barrow-downs is represented by a respective level.

'''2006: ''[[The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'':'''
:In his campaign against the former kingdom of Arnor the Witch-king dispatches his men lead by [[Hwaldar|Hwaldar]] to claim the royal barrows to enrage Cardolan and lure out their forces to destroy their army and lay Cardolan bare for his attacks, while unintentionally slaying a prince of Cardolan. Later he attacked the Barrow-downs a second time to desecrate the barrows to create a plague to weaken the rest of Arnor and to demotalize the Dúnedain of Cardolan by using the barrows as the plague's ground zero. In the resulting battle [[Karsh|Carthaen]], a general of Cardolan, was slain and Cardolan's sent army was destroyed.
