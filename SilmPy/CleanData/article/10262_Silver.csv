'''Silver''' is a highly reflective gray or white metal referenced often by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in his [[legendarium]].

One of the [[Two Trees]], [[Telperion]], was silver in color if not in material.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>  ''[[Mithril]]'' is said to highly resemble silver.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

The [[Falmari]] prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor.<ref>{{HM|UT}}, p. 266</ref>

Several examples of objects made of silver are the crown of [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], the silver harp of the [[House of the Harp]] in [[Gondolin]], the Tree of [[Gondor]], according to [[Bilbo Baggins]] the [[Uncommon words|habergeon]] of [[Eärendil]] (which, if true, suggests that silver was stronger in [[Middle-earth]] than in the real world), and one of the gates of Gondolin.  As well, it was often referenced in titles and names (for example [[Celeborn]], ''silver-tree'', [[Celebrimbor]], ''silver-hand'', and [[Celebrindal]], ''silver-foot'').
