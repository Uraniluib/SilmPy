The '''Last Debate''' was the council that [[Aragorn]] held with [[Imrahil]], [[Gandalf]], [[Éomer]], [[Elladan]], and [[Elrohir]]. It was held outside [[Minas Tirith]] on [[16 March|March 16]], [[Third Age 3019|3019]], and there it was decided "''that they should set forth on the  second morning from that day with seven thousands [of men], if these might be found''" to fight [[Sauron]] in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], in the hope that [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] might finish the [[Quest of the Ring]] in [[Mordor]].<ref name=RKV9>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

Also debated was what size expeditionary force should be mustered, and the number to leave behind for defense. In the end they decided to leave behind 3,000 Rohirrim to attack a very large blocking force stationed on the [[West Road]] in [[Anórien]]; 4,000 who were coming by land from [[Pelargir]];  possibly several thousand who were coming up the [[Anduin]]; and probably some 1-2,000 survivors from the siege of the city. All in all the defensive forces' numbers could been upwards of 9,000, fulfilling Aragorn's plan of leaving Minas Tirith with a larger defensive force than what it had before the siege began.<ref name=RKV9/>

The expeditionary force, known as the [[Army of the West]], numbered 7,000 men, and [[18 March|two days later]] they left for the Morannon.<ref name=RKV9/>
