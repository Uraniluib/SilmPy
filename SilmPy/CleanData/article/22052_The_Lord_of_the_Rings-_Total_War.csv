'''The Lord of the Rings: Total War''', or simply '''tlotrtw''', is a modification for the PC-game ''[[wikipedia:Rome: Total War|Rome: Total War]]'' of the Total War series by [[wikipedia:Sega|Sega]] and [[wikipedia:Activision|Activision]]. It changes Europe's map to a map of [[Middle-earth]], while retaining the turn-based strategic gameplay and real-time battles of the original. A simular project is [[Third Age: Total War]].
