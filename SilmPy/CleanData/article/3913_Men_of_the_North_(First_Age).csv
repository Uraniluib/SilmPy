'''Men of the North''' was a name given to the [[Men]] of the [[House of Hador]] and their followers, who ruled and defended the lands north and west of the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]] in alliance with the [[Elves]]. After the defeat of the [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the Men of the North were dispossessed of their lands, but many survived under the cruel lordship of the [[Easterlings]] put in their place by [[Morgoth]].
