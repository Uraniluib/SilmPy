==Summary==
The Board of the Faculty of English sent an appreciation of Tolkien's "long and invaluable service" upon his retirement.  Tolkien expressed his gratitude to the Board for their extremely generous terms.  He felt that they portrayed him as a professor far superior to the one that had retired.  He said it was a peculiar pleasure to receive honours and compliments undeserved.  He even missed the meetings of the Board â€“ not the agenda, of course, but all of his dear friends.
