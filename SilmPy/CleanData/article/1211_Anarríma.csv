__NOTOC__
'''Anarríma''' was one of the constellations set in the heavens by [[Varda]] to enlighten the awakening of the elves and gathered by Varda from among the ancient stars.<ref name="S">{{S|3}}</ref>

The making of the constellations (and of some new bright stars) happened 1000-1050 [[Valian Years]] after the first flowering of the Trees.<ref name="MR">{{HM|MR}}, pp. 71, 141 160</ref>
==Etymology==
The elements of the name seem to be ''anar'' 'sun', and ''ríma'' 'edge, hem, border', thus: 'Sun-border'.<ref name="LR">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries ''[[ANÁR]]'' and ''RÎ''</ref>
==Inspiration==
Anarríma is not identifiable with an actual constellation. The word ''ríma'' might refer to the Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown) or the Great Square of Pegasus, easily recognized from its four bright stars.
==Other versions of the legendarium==
Anarríma entered the mythology only in "[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]", composed after the completion of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in early 1950s.<ref name="MR" /> In the previous versions of the story, only [[Valacirca]] and [[Telumehtar]] / [[Menelmacar]] are mentioned.
