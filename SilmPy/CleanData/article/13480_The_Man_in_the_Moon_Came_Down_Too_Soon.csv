===Excerpt===
<poem>
The [[Man in the Moon]] had silver shoon
And his beard was of silver thread;
He was girt with pure gold and inaureoled
With gold about his head.
Clad in silken robe in his great white globe
He opened an ivory door
With a crystal key, and in secrecy
He stole o'er a shadowy floor...<ref>{{AB|Down}}</ref>
