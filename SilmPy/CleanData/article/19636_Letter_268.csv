==Summary==
A Miss A.P. Northey had enquired about the fate of [[Shadowfax]]. Tolkien told her that, because ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was written by chroniclers (in this case [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]), not everything needed to be told. And Sam, emotional as he was from the departure of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], omitted the fate of [[Gandalf]]'s trusted steed. Therefore one can only guess what happened, argues Tolkien. 

And Tolkien guessed that Shadowfax most certainly came with Gandalf to the [[Grey Havens]], and did not stay behind. It would have been noticed if he did, and after all, Shadowfax was one of the [[Mearas]]. Those horses descended from [[Nahar]], the horse of [[Oromë|Béma]], and thus had blood that came from [[Valinor|the West]].
