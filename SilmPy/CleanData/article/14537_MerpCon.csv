'''MerpCon''', or '''Middle-Earth Role Playing Convention''' is an annual convention held in Spokane, Washington. It is not endorsed by [[Middle-earth Enterprises]], the [[Tolkien Estate]], and not associated with [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' "[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]]".

==History==
MerpCon is held each year during the last weekend of July. It runs for 3 days from that Friday, through to the end of Sunday (and sometimes a little into the morning of that following Monday). The event is focused on Role Playing Gaming in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], using any game system adapted or created for play in Middle-earth or any aspect of Tolkien's universe. The [[MerpCon I|first MerpCon]] was organised in 2005, followed by a new one each year.

MerpCon was founded by [[Hawke Robinson]].
