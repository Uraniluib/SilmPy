'''Nornorë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Nornorë was herald of the Gods and was sent to the [[Cuiviénen|Koivië-néni]] to invite the [[Eldar]] to come to [[Valinor]]. He was replaced in later versions of the legendarium by [[Eönwë]] and [[Oromë]].

Nornorë played an important role in the afterlife of [[Men]] in this early version of the legendarium. [[Nienna|Fui]] would judge Men after they had died, sending some to [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]] or [[Angband|Angamandi]], but sending others to [[Avathar|Arvalin]] aboard the ship [[Mornië]]. Of those sent to Arvalin, some very few would be retrieved by Nornorë, who brought them by chariot to dwell in [[Valmar]] until the [[Dagor Dagorath|Great End]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref>

At the [[Chaining of Melkor|Chaining of Melko]], Nornorë ran before Manwë's chariot when the host of the Valar marched against [[Utumno|Utumna]]. As herald of the Gods, he was sent into the depths of [[Utumno|Utumna]] to speak before the seat of [[Morgoth|Melko]] with cunning words contrived by the Gods. The ruse worked: Nornorë convinced Melko that the Gods had come to pay him homage. Melko, blinded by his pride, allowed Manwë and the rest of the Gods entry to his halls. Once inside, they were able to capture him and put him in chains.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>

When the [[Eldar]] awoke in [[Palisor]], Nornorë was sent to them by the [[Valar|Gods]] as [[Manwë]]'s ambassador. Coming to Koivië-néni, he invited some of them to come with him to Valinor. [[Ingwë|Isil Inwë]], [[Finwë|Finwë Nólemë]], and [[Thingol|Tinwë Lintö]] heeded his call and he brought the three of them before the Gods, and then returned them to their folk at Koivië-néni. Upon returning, they convinced many of the Eldar to seek the Gods, and Nornorë brought the news to Valinor that the host of the Elves would indeed make the long journey west.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref>

Nornorë did not appear in later versions of the legendarium. His role as herald of the Gods came to be filled by [[Eönwë]], and [[Oromë]] became the Vala responsible for bringing Ingwë, Finwë, and [[Thingol|Elwë]] to Valinor as representatives of the Eldar and then returning them to Cuiviénen.

==Etymology==
''Nornorë'', also appearing as '''''Nornoros''''', is a [[Qenya]] name, derived from ''nornoro-'' ("run on, run smoothly"). The [[Gnomish]] version of his name is '''''Drondor''''' (later '''''Dronúrin''''').<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 263</ref> He was also given other names: Qenya '''''Kapalimor''''' (derived from ''kapalima'' "bounding, leaping"; Gnomish version '''''Cablin''''') and Qenya '''''Vastor''''' (derived from ''vastan'' "rush, of both noise and speed").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>
