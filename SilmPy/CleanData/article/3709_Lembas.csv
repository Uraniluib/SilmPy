'''Lembas''', translated as '''waybread''' in the [[Westron|Common Speech]], was a special food made by the [[Elves]]. 

==History==
Lembas was made first by [[Yavanna]] from special [[corn]] that grew in [[Aman]], and [[Oromë]] gave it to the Elves of the [[Great Journey]]. For this reason, it was an Elven custom that only women should make lembas; they were called [[Yavannildi]] who knew the secret of its recipe. Also, the custom requested that only an Elven Queen should keep and distribute the lembas, for this reason she was called also [[massánië]] or [[besain]].<ref name="PM">{{PM|Lembas}}</ref> 

Only on rare occasions was it given to non-Elves, because it was believed that mortals who ate it would become wary of their mortality and would desire to live among the Elves.<ref name="PM"/> 

The corn itself was an enduring plant that needed but a little sunlight to ripen and could be sown at any season and then sprouted and grew swiftly. Yet it was prone to north winds, while [[Morgoth]] dwelt there. The Eldar grew it in guarded lands and sunlit glades. The ears were harvested without scythe or sickle but each one was gathered by hands and the white stalks were drawn from the earth and used to weave baskets in which the grain was stored.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Lembas}}</ref>

[[Melian]], as the queen of [[Doriath]], was one who held this recipe from Yavanna. By giving lembas to [[Beleg]] for [[Túrin]]<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>, she showed great favor because never before lembas was given to a Man and seldom it was again. Later it was passed to [[Galadriel]] and other [[Elves]].

The [[Galadhrim]] had a large store of Lembas in [[Lothlórien]]. Galadriel gave some of it to the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] upon their departure. [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] subsisted on it through the majority of their journey from there into [[Mordor]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}</ref>

==Description==
The cakes were very nutritious, stayed fresh for months when wrapped in leaves, and were used for sustenance on long journeys. Lembas had a brownish colour on the outside and a cream colour on the inside. 

According to [[Gimli]] it was similar to [[Cram]], although one of the [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lothlórien]] commented that it was more pleasant, and more strengthening than any food by [[Men]].<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

Like other products of the Elves, it was offensive to evil creatures; [[Gollum]] refused outright to eat of it.<ref>{{HM|TT}}</ref> When Frodo was captured by [[orcs]] in Mordor, the orcs hated the look of the lembas even more than Gollum.

==Etymology and Names==
'''Lembas''' is Sindarin and derived from the older ''lenn-mbass'' which means "journey-bread". As a rough translation of this term it was also often called ''Waybread''.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Lembas}}</ref>

The [[Quenya]] word for lembas is ''coimas'' which means ''life-bread''.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Lembas}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
The name "Waybread" resembles in a way the [[Old English]] name for the herb [[Wikipedia:plantain|plantain]], which was ''wegbrade''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The redundant term "lembas bread" is occasionally used as the gift of lembas at Lothlórien is not included in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. The term "lembas bread" was probably chosen in order to immediately identify the substance to filmgoers at the beginning of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''.
