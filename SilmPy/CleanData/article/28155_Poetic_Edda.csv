The '''''Poetic Edda''''' or '''''Elder Edda''''' is a collection of [[Old Norse]] alliterative verse poetry preserved in a 13th century Icelandic manuscript, the Codex Regius. Together with the 13th century Prose Edda, it is the primary surviving source for Germanic legend and Norse myth. One of the poems contained in it, the ''[[Völuspá]]'', was a major source of inspiration to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].
