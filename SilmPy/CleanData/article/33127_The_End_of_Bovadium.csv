"'''The End of Bovadium'''" (author's title),<ref name=CGL>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Rayner Unwin 2 December 1968]]" (letter), quoted in {{CG|C}}, p. 737</ref> also commonly referred to as "'''The Bovadium Fragments'''", is an unpublished story by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], possibly written in the early 1960s.<ref name=Bio>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 163</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 255-6</ref>

In [[1968]], Tolkien included ''The End of Bovarium'' among those of his unpublished works that he had "''no intention of publishing now (if ever), or of allowing them to get in the way of my proper work''."<ref name=CGL/> However, earlier Tolkien seems to have been of a different opinion. On [[25 October]] [[1960]] Tolkien sought (through his secretary [[Elisabeth Lumsden]]) to publish what is believed to be this writing (since it was described as "a sort of satirical fantasy") in the magazine ''[[Wikipedia:Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''.<ref group="note">Tolkien had earlier published his poem "[[Imram]]" in the magazine ''Time and Tide'' (issue 3 December 1955. Cf. {{SD|2}}, p. 296.</ref><ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 563</ref> And on [[24 August]] [[1966]] Tolkien lent [[Rayner Unwin]] the manuscript, who wrote to Tolkien already the next day, thinking that he "''should publish it in the'' [[Wikipedia:The Oxford Magazine|Oxford Magazine]]." Also [[Clyde S. Kilby]] was given a copy, being asked if the piece was worthy of publication.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 673</ref> Kilby would later ([[1976]]) recall that the story was:

{{quote|[a] satire written long before and having as its main point the worship of the Motores, i.e., automobiles, and the traffic jams blocking the roads in and around Oxford. It was full of the inventiveness to be expected of Tolkien. Some of the characters are Rotzopny, Dr. Gums, and Sarevelk. I judged that it had two elements that would make it unpublishable. One was the more than liberal use of Latin, and the other the probability that a reader's eye would focus on its playfulness rather than its serious implications. Actually it was an early comment on the commercialization of our world.|Clyde S. Kilby<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], ''[[Tolkien and The Silmarillion|Tolkien & The Silmarillion]]'', p. 36</ref>}}

A few more details about the contents were provided in [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s summary dating from [[1977]], saying that the story "''is a parable of the destruction of [[Oxford]] (''Bovadium'') by the'' motores ''manufactured by the'' Daemon ''of'' Vaccipratum ''(a reference to [[Wikipedia:Lord Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]] and his motor-works at Cowley) which blocks the streets, asphyxiate the inhabitants, and finally explode''." Carpenter also notes that the theme of "motor transport" connects the story to ''[[Mr. Bliss]]''.<ref name=Bio/>

The writing is kept at the [[Bodleian Library]] (Department of Western Manuscripts, Mss. Tolkien, Series A, folder A62, pages 38-91),<ref name=MB>{{HM|MB}}, p. 462</ref> which suggests that the manuscript consists of 53 pages.<ref>"[http://www.jrrvf.com/forum/noncgi/Forum1/HTML/001310.html La Machine ou la nécessité de raser le monde réel]" (French) at [http://www.jrrvf.com Jrrvf.com] (accessed 5 May 2011)</ref>
