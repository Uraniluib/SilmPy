}}'''Tar-Calmacil''' was the eighteenth ruler of [[Númenor]].  
==History==
''Calmacil'' was the son of [[Tar-Alcarin]]. He was a great warrior of his nation, further expanding [[Númenor]]'s influence in [[Middle-earth]]. He was also an ardent member of the [[King's Men]] and during his time [[Númenóreans]] became increasingly hardened against the will of the [[Valar]].

After the death of his father, Calmacil took up the [[Sceptre]] as [[Tar-Calmacil]], and succeeded extensive conquests along the coasts of [[Middle-earth]].  This activity angered [[Sauron]], yet he withdrew and concentrated on building power in the East.

During his reign the [[King's Men]] called him by his name in [[Adûnaic]]: Ar-Belzagar.  This was the first time that the King's name was spoken in this language.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Tar-Calmacil</ref>
His successors also had Adûnaic names, further showing their disdain for [[Elves]] and the [[Valar]].

He was succeeded by his son [[Tar-Ardamin]].

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that his name means in [[Quenya]] "light-sword", containing the word ''[[macil]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo|website=Arda}}</ref>
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In Appendix A of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Ar-Adûnakhôr was listed as following Tar-Calmacil<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref> while in the more detailed [[The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor]] from the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' the next ruler was [[Tar-Ardamin]].  According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], Tar-Ardamin was simply omitted and did belong in the list.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, Note 11</ref>
