'''''The Road Goes Ever On''''' contains poems by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], all appearing in his writings on [[Middle-earth]], set to music by [[Donald Swann]]. The book is divided in two major sections: (1) a collection of sheet music (2) the final chapter ''Notes and Translations'' written by Tolkien. The latter consists of scripts, translations and comments on the Elvish texts for "[[Namárië]]" and "[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]", and is an important document in being a "glossary of Elvish terms and lore that appears nowhere else"<ref>Quote from the cover of the 3rd edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On''.</ref>. For example, it contains one of the longest samples of the language [[Quenya]].

The book was richly decorated by Tolkien.
