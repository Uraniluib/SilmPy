'''The Tale of Tinúviel''' is the first chapter of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. It was one of the earlier versions of the story of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], later revisited as the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' and ''[[Of Beren and Lúthien]]'' from the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''.  Differences from the later version include the following:

* [[Tevildo]] is the first version of [[Thû]]/[[Sauron]]
* The knife Beren uses to cut out the [[Silmaril]] is a kitchen-knife of Tevildo rather than [[Angrist]]
* Lúthien wears silver-white instead of sky-blue
