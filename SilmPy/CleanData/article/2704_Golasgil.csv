}}'''Golasgil''' was the lord of [[Anfalas]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Golasgil led a long line of men to [[Minas Tirith]] before the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]].  All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>  However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]] it appears that he did survive the great battle.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
