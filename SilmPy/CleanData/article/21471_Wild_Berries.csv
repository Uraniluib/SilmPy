'''Wild Berries''' grew in the upper [[Vales of Anduin]].  In {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> as [[Gandalf]], [[Thorin and Company|the dwarves]], and [[Bilbo Baggins]] sought to escape from the [[Orcs|goblins]] in the [[Misty Mountains]], famished Bilbo looked for food as they marched.  Although the blackberries were still in flower and he could not find any hawthorn-berries, Bilbo did manage to find three wild strawberries.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>
