'''Calenardhon''' was a wide green landscape in the north of [[Gondor]], part of [[Anórien]].

==History==
It was devastated or deserted by the [[Great Plague]] and during the [[Watchful Peace]] the Númenórean garrisons of the forts were not renewed, and local chieftains (whose subjects were increasingly of mixed blood) gained more control. The [[Dunlendings]] decided to repopulate it.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

During the rule of the [[Steward of Gondor|Steward]] [[Cirion]], [[Gondor]] faced a series of attacks by the [[Balchoth]], and Calenardhon was overrun by these evil people. Cirion sent messages for help to Gondor's old allies, including the [[Éothéod]], to help defend Gondor.

[[Eorl the Young]] answered the call, and helped Gondor defeat the Balchoth at the [[Field of Celebrant]]. In gratitude, Cirion granted all Calenardhon, except for [[Anórien]], to the Éothéod.

After the Éothéod settled in Calenardhon, the land became known as [[Rohan]] or the [[Riddermark]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Calenardhon.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Calenardhon''''' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "Green Province"<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], "[[Index questions]]". Cf. [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (HarperCollins''Publishers'' 2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 477</ref> or "the (great) green region"<ref>{{L|297}}</ref> (''[[calen]]'' "green" + ''[[ardhon]]'' "province, great region"). 

The hypothetical [[Old Sindarin]] would likely be *''Kalinardondo''.<ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/archive.html 2000 "Cabor" edition of the Sindarin Dictionary] (accessible through [http://www.jrrvf.com/cgi-bin/hisweloke/register.cgi?license=show here]); entries "calen" and "ardhon"</ref>

Earlier names used by Tolkien for this region were ''[[Elenarda (disambiguation)|Elenarda]]'' > ''Kalen(arda)'' > ''Kalinarda'' > ''Calenardan'' >  ''Calenardon''.<ref>{{WR|2|V}}</ref><ref>{{PM|VII}}</ref>
