'''Coirë''' translates to 'stirring' and is the [[Quenya]] name for the [[Elvish]] season between winter and spring. In the [[Reckoning of Rivendell]] it was the last season of the year, and corresponded more or less to the 54 days between [[11 February]] and [[4 April]] in the [[Shire Calendar]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
