'''Amon Hen''' ([[Sindarin]]  ''[[amon]]'' “hill” + ''[[hen]]'' “eye”) was the westernmost of the three peaks at the southern end of [[Nen Hithoel]].  

==Description==
On its eastern side at the foot of the hill lay the lawn of [[Parth Galen]] and the western portion of the [[Anduin]] that flowed past [[Tol Brandir]]. Above Parth Galen the hill rose in gentle slopes to its flattened summit. Just to the south of the hill was the [[North Stair]].<ref name="Amon">{{FR|II10}}</ref> The western face of the hill was steeper than on the east.<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>

Upon Amon Hen were the remains of an ancient road that had dwindled to little more than a path.  In places where the hill grew steep, stairs had been hewn, although over time they had become cracked, worn, and split by tree roots. The path wound through [[Rowans|rowan]] trees to the summit, where there was a wide flat circle paved with large stones and encircled with a ruined battlement.  In the center of the circle was an ancient chair, the [[Seat of Seeing]].<ref name="Amon"/>

The Seat of Seeing was an ancient chair built upon the summit of Amon Hen within a great circular stone-paved court surrounded by a battlement. By the time [[Frodo Baggins]] visited the Seat it lay in ruins. The high seat rested upon four carven pillars and could be reached by a stair of many steps.<ref name="Amon">{{FR|II10}}</ref>

==History==
===Early History===
The high seat upon Amon Hen had been made in the days of the great kings, according to [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref> The high seat was built before the time of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]], which meant that when Frodo sat there it was at a minimum 969 years old. One likely possibility is that the Seat of Seeing was built at the same time as the [[Argonath]], which occurred after [[Rómendacil II|Minalcar]] defeated the [[Easterlings]] (in {{TA|1248}}) but before the end of his reign (he died in {{TA|1366}}).<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

===Later History===
On [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}, after Frodo had fled from [[Boromir]] he came to the summit of the hill and, while still wearing [[the One Ring]], sat in the high seat. At first he saw little but mist and shadows, but soon he perceived many visions, soundless but filled with bright living images. The visions he saw stretched far beyond the normal range of sight (for instance, he saw the [[Ethir Anduin]], over 300 miles away and behind the [[White Mountains]]) and everywhere he looked he saw signs of war. His glimpse of [[Minas Tirith]] filled him with hope, which was crushed when he looked at [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name="Amon"/> 

Frodo then became aware of the gaze of the [[Eye of Sauron|Eye]], which felt like a finger was trying to nail him down. He jumped out of the chair and cowered with his hood covering his head. At that moment from some other point of power came another thought: “Take it off! P Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!” Balanced between Eye and Voice, Frodo regained his ability to choose and removed the Ring an instant before he was discovered. Frodo then realised what he must do, which was to go to [[Mordor]] alone, and he left the Seat of Seeing behind.<ref name="Amon"/> While searching for Frodo, [[Aragorn]] ran to the summit and sat on the chair.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref> Even though he was the heir of [[Isildur]] he saw no visions.

The identity of the Voice that strove against the Eye was later revealed when Aragorn, [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]] first meet [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]] in [[Fangorn Forest]]. Gandalf informs the others that the Ring was nearly revealed to [[Sauron]] but “I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark Tower; and the Shadow passed”.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is [[Sindarin]] and means '''Hill of the Eye''', from ''[[amon]]'' "hill" and ''[[hen]]'' "eye", which is how it was also known in [[Westron]]. Another name was the '''Hill of Sight'''. 
==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:The scene at the Seat of Seeing is altered and condensed. Frodo, wearing the Ring, ran up a platform (no chair is seen) and the only vision he experienced was of Barad-dúr and the Eye. Confronted by the Eye and voice of Sauron, Frodo yanked off the Ring and fell off the platform. Unlike the book, he then met Aragorn and told Aragorn he must leave. The force of [[Uruk-hai]] from [[Saruman]] then arrived and Frodo fled while Aragorn, later joined by Legolas and Gimli, fought the orcs on the hilltop.
