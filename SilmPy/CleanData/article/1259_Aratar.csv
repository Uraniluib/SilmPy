'''Aratar''' ('The Exalted'; [[arat]] = high, -r = plural suffix) were the '''High Ones of Arda''', the greatest of the [[Valar]]: [[Manwë]], [[Varda]], [[Ulmo]], [[Yavanna]], [[Aulë]], [[Mandos]], [[Nienna]] and [[Oromë]]. Though [[Manwë]] was held to be the High King of [[Arda]], the '''Eight''' were held in equal reverence, and were said to possess a majesty that surpassed even the other [[Valar]].

The Aratar were originally nine and included [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (probably as the greatest of them) but he was removed from this 'order' after his rebellion.<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref>
