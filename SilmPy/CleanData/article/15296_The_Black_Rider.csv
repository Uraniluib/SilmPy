'''The Black Rider''' is the fifth track of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' by [[Howard Shore]]. It is played during the period of time in the film that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] run into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] in [[Farmer Maggot]]'s cornfields, tumble down the embankment, and escape the [[Nazg√ªl|Black Riders]] to [[Bucklebury Ferry]].

It begins with a merry, excited, Hobbit-like tune played on the penny-whistle and violin, but quicker and hinting at the mischevious.  The brass are bouncing up and down on the scale in the background.  Suddenly there is chaos among the two parts that suddenly dissolves into the sinister long, dark bass notes, followed by an eerie chorus gradually entering while the strings dance quietly.  It breaks into the brass leaping back and forth on the scale, seeming to peter down, but suddenly breaking once more into a loud chorus as the Black Rider theme is played loud on brass and chorus.  Once again the chorus fades, and it begins to run down slowly, ending on a long, yet sinister bass note.
