'''Andúril''' was the name for the sword '''[[Narsil]]''' after its reforging in [[Third Age 3018]] for [[Aragorn]], the heir of [[Isildur]]. 
==Appearance==
Its blade had engraved the designs of [[Seven Stars]] between the rayed [[Sun]] and the crescent [[Moon]], symbols of [[Elendil]], and his sons [[Anárion]] and [[Isildur]]. It also had many [[cirth]]. Its blade was notably brilliant, justifying its name.
==History==
Narsil was a symbol of the kingship of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], but was broken at the end of the [[Second Age]]. Its fragments remained a heirloom for the [[Kings of Arnor]], and the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]]. 

[[Boromir]], son of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]], travelled to [[Rivendell]] for the [[Council of Elrond]] because of the prophetic dream of his brother [[Faramir]]. The dream told him to "[[Seek for the Sword that was broken|seek for the Sword that was broken]]".<ref name="CoE">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Finally, after three thousand years, when [[Aragorn]] set out for the [[War of the Ring]], Narsil was reforged by Elven smiths of Rivendell, and Aragorn renamed it "Andúril". 

Aragorn carried the sword during his journey south as part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], and fought with it, the '''Sword That Was Broken''' or the '''Sword Reforged'''. When entering [[Meduseld]] he initially refused to surrender it to Doorward [[Háma]] and entered a long argument with him, until convinced so by [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>

Already famous during the [[War of the Ring]], Aragorn often used the sword to help establish his credentials as the [[Heir of Isildur]] and the throne of Gondor. This was especially true when he convinced the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men of Dunharrow]] to fulfill their oath to support Gondor in its time of need.

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Anduril.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Andúril'' means "Flame of the West" in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 34 (form: ''Andūril'')</ref> composed of ''[[andúnë]]'', "west" and ''[[ril]]'', "brilliance"). "West" here refers to [[Númenor]].
==Inspiration==
Broken swords that are reforged are also seen in the ''Volsungasaga'' and the ''Nibelungenlied''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Narsil is reforged after Rivendell, though this reforging is not shown. Neither Narsil nor Andúril are named.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Narsil is reforged after Rivendell, and Aragorn carries Andúril thereafter.

'''2001: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Because of Aragorn's ''warrior''-persona in this video game, Andúril merely serves as a melee weapon upgrade after Rivendell.<ref name="Veugen">Connie Veugen, "'A Man, lean, dark, tall': Aragorn Seen Through Different Media", published in ''[[Reconsidering Tolkien]]'' (edited by [[Thomas M. Honegger]] ([http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/10975/1/Aragorn_Final.pdf read in PDF]))</ref>  Aragorn does not use the broken sword at any point prior. Notably, the sword's blade is constantly illuminated; it glows red during the day, and blue at night. In the game's credits, artist Jason Rosenstock is explicitly mentioned as the designer of Andúril.<ref>[[Vivendi]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', User Manual, page 22, "Aragorn Sword Design"</ref>

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', when asked by [[Háma]] to disarm outside [[Meduseld]], Aragorn is very reluctant, saying that normally he would give up his weapon, "if I bore now any sword but Andúril".<ref name="tKotGH">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', "[[The King of the Golden Hall]]"</ref> This scene and dialogue is omitted from the film on the grace that the sword Aragorn surrenders there was not Andúril. 

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Andúril is not forged from the shards of Narsil until late in the third film. [[Elrond]] had the sword reforged only after [[Arwen]]'s pleading. He then took the sword to Aragorn in the camp of the [[Rohirrim]] at [[Dunharrow]]. Aragorn's acceptance of the sword, along with his decision at that time to take the [[Paths of the Dead]], showed his willingness to accept his destiny of becoming king. 

:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition]], the [[Mouth of Sauron]] refers to the blade as Elvish; this could either be a reference to its reforging or a mistake on behalf of the writers.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]] (adaptors), [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (extended edition)]], "[[The Mouth of Sauron (scene)|The Mouth of Sauron]]"</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The reforging of Narsil is experienced by the player in the quest arc called "The Blade that was Broken". The player sets out to find the last of the Silithair, shining adamants crafted by Elves of the house of [[Fëanor]] in days of old, in order for the Elf-smiths of Imladris to reforge the sword into Andúril.<ref>[http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Quest_Arc:The_Blade_That_Was_Broken Quest Arc: The Blade That Was Broken], Lorebook, lotro.com</ref>
