'''Wights''' was a name used for [[undead]] beings,<ref>{{RK|Company}}: "''And some said: 'They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong, into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.<nowiki>'</nowiki>''"</ref> especially as a short form for the [[Barrow-wights]].<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, ''passim''</ref>

==Etymology==

''wight'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''wiht'', meaning "living being, creature".  The related [[wikipedia:Old Saxon|Old Saxon]] ''wiht'' means "thing, demon".<ref> Douglas Harper, "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wight wight]" at [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary] (accessed 30 December 2010); a curiosity is that the Swedish cognate ''vätte'' ("spirit of the earth, gnome") was used to translate the word "[[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|goblin]]" (cf. J.R.R. Tolkien, Britt G. Hallqvist (transl.), ''[[The Hobbit|Bilbo: en hobbits äventyr]]''<!-- noted by User:Morgab -->)</ref> It has been suggested that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had this later "''connection to the underworld in mind when he chose to refer to the grave-spirits of the Barrow-downs as 'wights'''".<ref>Mark Fisher, "[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/b/barrowwights.html Barrow-wights: Evil spirits out of Angmar]" at [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] (accessed 30 December 2010)</ref>

Many works of fantasy fiction, role-playing games and computer and video games use the term ''wight'' as the name of spectral creatures very similar to Tolkien's Barrow-wights: [[Dungeons and Dragons]] has created a monster called "[[Wikipedia:Wight (Dungeons & Dragons)|Wight]]", a kind of undead, and the new terminology is also exemplified in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series: "''Who has been beyond the wall of death to see? Only the wights, and we know what they are like. We know.''"<ref>[[George R. R. Martin]] (2005), ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' book IV, ''A Feast for Crows''</ref>
