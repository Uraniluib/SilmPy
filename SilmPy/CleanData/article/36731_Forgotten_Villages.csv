The '''Forgotten Villages''' were the settlements of the [[Hobbits]] after they had migrated westward across the [[Misty Mountains]] but before they had settled [[the Shire]].

==History==
When Greenwood the Great became darkened and was renamed [[Mirkwood]] the Hobbits who had lived in the upper vales of [[Anduin]] crossed the Misty Mountains into [[Eriador]].  The [[Harfoots]] moved in {{TA|1050}} while the [[Fallohides]] and [[Stoors]] made the journey c. {{TA|1150|n}}.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>  The Harfoots settled between [[Weathertop]] and the mountains, the Stoors dwelt between [[Tharbad]] and [[Dunland]], and the Fallohides mingled with the others (often becoming leaders among the Harfoot and Stoor clans).<ref name="Hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

Around {{TA|1300}} the realm of [[Angmar]] arose and the Hobbits began moving west again, with many settling in [[Bree]].  Finally, in {{TA|1601}}, King [[Argeleb II]] granted the Hobbits land beyond the [[Baranduin]] when the majority of them moved and established the Shire. <ref name="Great"/>  By the time of [[Bilbo Baggins]] all of the earlier settlements had vanished and been forgotten, except for those Hobbits still living in Bree and its environs.<ref name="Hobbits"/>

==Note==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] never referred to the "Forgotten Villages" by name; they were given this identification in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', Migrations of the Hobbits</ref>
