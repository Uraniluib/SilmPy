'''Trollshaws''' were the upland woods, consisting at least partly of [[Beeches|beech]] trees, that lay to the west of [[Rivendell]] between the Rivers [[Hoarwell]] and [[Bruinen|Loudwater]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

On the hills of the Trollshaws were shallow caves, such as the [[Troll's Cave]], and Mannish castles and towers.
==History==
Trollshaws were within the borders of [[Arnor]] and later of the smaller realm of [[Rhudaur]]. The [[Men]] of Rhudaur built castles and towers on the top of some of its hills.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

They were the haunt of [[Trolls]], especially after the fall of Arnor; [[Stone-trolls]] from "the mountains" came to the woodlands. This was the case of [[William]] who led [[Tom]] and [[Bert]]; having eaten a village and a half on their way, they complained about the scarcity of people in the area and instead had to make do with mutton. While they made their camp, they famously waylaid [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Thorin and Company|his companions]] who were on their [[Quest of Erebor]]. Thanks to the distractions of [[Gandalf]], the Trolls were turned to stone by the [[Sun]].<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> Years later, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions traversed the woodland and found the Trolls' petrified forms on the way to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Shaws is an archaic word meaning "thicket, wood".

The woods geographically belonged to where the ancient realm of [[Rhudaur]] used to be, and were perhaps named after it; ''Rhudaur'' means "troll-shaws" in [[Westron|Common Speech]]<ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Trollshaws is where [[Arwen]] encounters [[Aragorn]] and the Hobbits - right near Old Bilbo's stone Trolls.

[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Trollshaws map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Trollshaws from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Trollshaws is one of main regions of the game, lasting from the [[Last Bridge]] to the valley of [[Rivendell]]. The river [[Bruinen]] plays a prominent role there, with both Bruinen Gorges and the hills of Tal Bruinen being important landmarks. This area is inhabited by dozens of non-playable characters, who are involved in hundreds of quests.

'''2012: ''[[ The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:As in the book, the Company traverse the Trollshaws where they have a similar adventure with the Trolls.
