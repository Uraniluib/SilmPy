'''Baravorn''' is the translation into [[Sindarin]] of the [[Hobbitish]] name ''[[Ranugad]]''. [[Aragorn|Elessar]] addressed [[Gaffer Gamgee|Samwise Gamgee]] as such in the ''[[King's Letter]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', "[[The Epilogue]]"</ref>
==Etymology==
The first element is ''[[bar]]'', "home". The second element, ''[[avorn]]'', is unclear. Though it is usually taken to be related to ''[[boron|bor(o)n]]'', " steadfast",<ref>[[Carl F. Hostetter]], "The ''King's Letter'', An Historical and Comparative Analysis", in [[Vinyar Tengwar 31]] (September [[1993]]), pages 12-34.</ref>, it could also be related to the root ''[[ABA]]'', indicating a reluctance to leave.
