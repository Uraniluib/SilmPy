'''Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review''' is an annual journal of scholarship on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his works. Since the publication of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in [[1937]], the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien have been admired throughout the world. With the publication in the 1950s of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien's fantasy writing began to attract academic attention in both the classroom and the world of scholarship. Most recently, [[Peter Jackson]]'s three-part movie adaptation has added film-study scholars to those fascinated by Tolkien's work. ''Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review'' is the first scholarly journal published by an academic press for the purpose of presenting and reviewing the growing body of critical commentary and scholarship about Tolkien's writings. The founding editors - [[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[Michael D.C. Drout]], and [[Verlyn Flieger]] - and the members of the editorial board - [[David Bratman]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]], [[Tom Shippey]], [[Richard C. West]], and [[Marjorie Burns]] - are all distinguished Tolkien scholars.
