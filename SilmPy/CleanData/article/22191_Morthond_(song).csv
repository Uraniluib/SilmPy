<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
We heard horns in hills ringing 
The swords shining in South-kingdom 
Steeds went striding to the Stoningland 
As winds in morning. War was there. 

There run dark waters 
Morthond, under mountains 
Death in the morning and at day's end 
Lords took and lowly... 

Grey now 
as tears gleaming 
silver, red it rolled then 
foam dyed with blood 

Grey now as tears gleaming silver 
Red then it rolled... water 
Foam dyed with blood flamed at a sunset 
As flowers mountains burned at evening
