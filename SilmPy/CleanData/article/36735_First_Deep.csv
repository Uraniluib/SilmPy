The '''First Deep''' was the level in [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] immediately beneath the [[Great Gates]] on the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]].  After the battle in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] fled down seven flights of stairs and traveled about a mile, arriving at the [[Second Hall]] on the First Deep.  It was on this level that the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] lay.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>
