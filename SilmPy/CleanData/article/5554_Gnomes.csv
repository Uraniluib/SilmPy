The term '''Gnomes''' or '''Noldoli''' was briefly used in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s early work ''[[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|The Book of Lost Tales]]'' to describe the race of [[Elves]] that would become the '''[[Noldor]]'''. In those works he borrowed several folkloric names to describe his original creations, like [[Fae]], [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Ogres]] and [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]].

The names of the Noldoli are in the [[Goldogrin]] (or Gnomish) language.

==Etymology==
In a letter dating from [[1973]], Tolkien stated that the word ''gnome'' derives from  [[Wikipedia:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Elena Jeronimides]]" (letter)</ref> who is known to have used Modern Latin ''gnomus'' in a 16th century treatise.<ref>{{webcite|author=Douglas Harper|articleurl=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gnome&allowed_in_frame=0|articlename=gnome|dated=|website=[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php Online Etymology Dictionary]|accessed=19 June 2012}}</ref>

The word likely comes from ''genomos'' "earth-dweller". It has a similarity with Greek ''γνώσις'' gnosis "knowledge" which is why Tolkien used it for the wise clan of his Elves ([[Quenya]] ''[[Noldor|Ñoldo]]'' "the Wise").{{fact}}

Cf. also the [[Mannish]] word ''[[nóm]]'' meaning "wisdom".

==Inspiration==
A [[Wikipedia:Gnome|Gnome]] is a dwarf-like creature of European folklore, often associated with [[Dwarves]] and [[Orcs|Goblins]]. Traditional Gnomes however were unlike his depiction of his [[High Elves]], they were imagined as deformed, underground and by the 19th century were depicted dwarf-like. 

For that reason Tolkien dropped the term since that would confuse the readers. However, other folkloric names like "Elves", "Dwarves" and "Goblins" would persist in Tolkien's writing ever since, although he would be unsure about them (he did replace "Goblin" with "[[Orcs]]" after the publication of ''[[The Hobbit]]").

In the first Portuguese translation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the title of the book is translated as ''[[Wiktionary:gnomo#Portuguese|gnomo]]'', the Portuguese word for gnome. See: ''[[O Gnomo]]''.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
At one time, "Gnomes" also referred to the [[Valar]].
