'''Woody End''' was an upland wooded region of the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]], lying between the [[Green Hill Country]] on the west and the [[Marish]] on the east.  Its woods were the sources of the [[Stock-brook]] and the [[Thistle Brook]]. One the northern eaves of the region was [[Woodhall]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>

On the evening of [[24 September]] {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] met [[Gildor Inglorion]] and his party of wandering elves in the Woody End.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>
