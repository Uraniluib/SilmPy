'''Tatyar''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtacar]}}) was the original name of the second Clan of the Elves, before the [[Great March]]. The Clan-name, meaning 'Seconds' (q. cardinal ''(t)atya'' 'second') was derived from the name of the father of the Clan, [[Tata]] 'Two', the second [[Elf-fathers|Elf-father]] to awake at [[Cuiviénen]]. 

The other original clans in Cuiviénen were the [[Minyar]] 'Firsts', and [[Nelyar]] 'Thirds' according to the Elf-fathers [[Imin]] 'One' and [[Enel]] 'Three'. The Tatyar were 56 in number out of the original 144 Elves who awoke at Cuiviénen. Half of them followed [[Finwë]] in the March and became the [[Noldor]] and half of them [[Avari|stayed back]] with [[Morwë]] and/or [[Nurwë]]. 

Some of the Avari who were of the Tatyar eventually reached [[Beleriand]] and acknowledged  their kinship with the [[Noldor]], but were unfriendly, jealous of their more exalted kin, and considered them arrogant.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 380-1</ref>
