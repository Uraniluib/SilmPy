'''Sam's garden box''' was the [[Gifts of Galadriel|gift]] [[Samwise Gamgee]] received from [[Galadriel]].

Before the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] left [[Lothl√≥rien]], [[Galadriel]] presented each of them with gifts. To [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] she gave a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

It contained earth from Galadriel's orchard, the earth was like grey dust, soft and fine, and in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shell. After the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. The little silver nut he planted in the [[Party Field]] where [[the Party Tree]] had once been, and the nut grew into a [[Mallorn]] tree: the only Mallorn west of the [[misty Mountains|Mountains]] and east of the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and one of the finest in the world.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>
