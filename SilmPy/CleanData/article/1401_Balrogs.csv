{{Pronounce|Balrog.mp3|Ardamir}}
The '''Balrogs''', or '''Balrogath''' ("Balrog-kind") were [[Maiar]] corrupted by [[Morgoth]] during the creation of [[Arda]], who cloaked themselves in shadow and flame and carried whips and swords.    Famed Balrogs include [[Gothmog]], slain by [[Ecthelion]], and [[Durin's Bane]], slain by [[Gandalf|Olórin]] (Gandalf).

== History ==
Balrogs, also called [[Valaraukar]], were a group of [[Maiar]] who were seduced by [[Morgoth]] and corrupted for his service before the coming of the [[Elves]]. They were of close relation to [[Arien]], the Maia who guided the sun. The Balrogs were originally gathered by [[Morgoth]] in his ancient fortress of [[Utumno]] during the [[Years of the Lamps]]. When this fortress was destroyed by the [[Valar]], they fled to the North and hid in the pits of [[Angband]], awaiting their master's return.

When [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]] escaped from [[Valinor]] many years later with the [[Silmarils]], the Balrogs were still awaiting their master in [[Angband]]. Ungoliant threatened [[Morgoth]], demanding the Silmarils for herself, but the Balrogs issued from their hiding-place and rescued their lord.

The Balrogs were first encountered by the Elves during the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] ("Battle under the Stars") in the First Age. After the victory of the [[Noldor|Noldorin Elves]] over Morgoth's forces, the Elf Lord [[Fëanor]] pressed on towards [[Angband]], but the Balrogs came up against him. He was surrounded and fought long against them before being mortally wounded by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of the Balrogs (the only Balrog known by name). Though Fëanor's sons fought off the demons of fire, Fëanor died of his wounds soon after.

After the last battle of the First Age, some Balrogs escaped the Valar's wrath and hid deep underground, in inaccessible places at the roots of the earth. Only one Balrog appears after the chaining of [[Melkor]]. If Sauron had any in his service during the [[Second Age]] or during the [[War of the Ring]], they were never revealed. In the Third Age the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] unwittingly released the Balrog, afterwards known as [[Durin's Bane]], while mining for ''[[mithril]]'' and were driven out of Moria by the creature. Appearing in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', it is the only Balrog described by Tolkien after the [[War of Wrath]] and was the Balrog that Gandalf battled on the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]].

== Other versions of the Legendarium ==
In one of Tolkien's early Middle-earth writings, ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', "[[Lungorthin]], Lord of Balrogs" is mentioned. It is not, however, certain if it was another name for Gothmog, or if it simply meant "a Balrog lord". According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the latter is more probable, as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.

The Balrogs were originally envisioned as being immense in number:
{{quote|The early conception of Balrogs makes them less terrible, and certainly more destructible, than they afterwards became: they existed in 'hundreds' (p. 170), and were slain by [[Tuor]] and the [[Gondolin|Gondothlim]] in large numbers: "thus five fell before Tuor's great axe [[Dramborleg]], three before [[Ecthelion]]'s sword, and two score were slain by the warriors of the king's house.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', commentary by Christopher Tolkien on "The Fall of Gondolin"}}
{{quote|There came wolves and serpents and there came Balrogs one thousand, and there came Glomund the Father of Dragons.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter 16, §15}}

As the [[legendarium]] became more formidable and internally consistent, and the Balrogs more terrible, this number was much reduced. In the end Tolkien stated that there were probably "at most" seven Balrogs:
{{quote|In the margin my father wrote: 'There should not be supposed more than say 3 or at most 7 ever existed.'|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', Section 2 (AAm*): note 50}}

It should, however, be noted that these texts postdate the published ''The Lord of the Rings'', but predate the materials from which the published ''The Silmarillion'' was drawn. The exact number of Balrogs is therefore very uncertain, but Tolkien's note above seems to have been his final word.

==Etymology==
Balrog is [[Sindarin]] for "Demon of Might" from ''[[balan|bal-]]'', "power" and ''[[raug]], [[rog]]'', "demon".

The [[Quenya]] form '''''[[Valarauko]]''''' points to a possible [[Primitive Quendian]] form *''balaraukô''.

In the earlier [[The Etymologies|Etymologies]], the word Balrog was derived from ''[[ñgwalaraukô]]'',<ref>{{HM|LR}}, [[The Etymologies]], RUK</ref> but this is inconsistent with Quenya ''Valarauko''.

A list of [[Old English]] equivalents of [[Elvish]] words, glosses ''[[Balrogs|Balrog]]'' as having the equivalent ''Bealuwearg'' and ''Bealubroga''. As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the Old English word contains the elements ''bealu'' ("evil"; as in ''bale(ful)'') and ''wearg'' ("wolf, outlaw") or ''broga'' ("terror").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>

If adaptations were to be counted as canon, the matter of Balrog wings would be decided.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane has wings, albeit wings that were purely decorative as the Balrog could not fly. [[Peter Jackson|Jackson]]'s Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only its horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Balrog has, once again, wings. The fight sequence, in which the player is Gandalf, takes considerably longer: only after a short fight on the bridge does Gandalf let it collapse. 

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:The chase up the [[Endless Stair]] and the slime Balrog were omitted due to budget constraints.{{fact}} However, part of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog is shown at the beginning of the film, and the fight atop Zirak-Zigil is seen in a flashback after Gandalf's return.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|Sierra's The War of the Ring]]'':'''
:The Balrog is the most powerful magical power available to Servants of Sauron. They have horns and wings.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'':'''
:The players assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Balrog is the most powerful magical power available to both Mordor and Isengard faction. Visual appearance follows the movie version.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Unlike the original game, The Balrog is not available to Isengard faction, but only to Mordor and the new Goblin factions.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane can be observed in two "session plays" (player character not present): one depicts the awakening of the Balrog by Dwarves under [[Durin]] VI, the other depicts dwarves of [[Balin]]'s company fleeing from the ancient evil. After Gandalf defeats him, the lifeless body of [[Durin's Bane]] can be found on the slopes of [[Zirakzigil]]. Despite the players knowing the Balrog dead, another Servant of Sauron tests their will and fears, by portraying an illusion of it. In the illusion, the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog on the [[Endless Stair]] is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Balrog defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Balrog in order to combat the illusion.
:The game also features another Balrog: named Thaurlach, he can be found in the Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu, where [[Angmar]] meets [[Misty Mountains]]. He fled there are the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]], but was followed by an elf-maiden Glathlírel who was determined to end him. The Balrog eluded her for millennia, until she was able to face him in combat and defeat him. Rather than kill the Balrog, the two Blue Wizards decided to imprison him in the Rift, so that he could await his judgment at the end of days. However, by the end of the Third Age his chains were loosening and a band of players was sent to defeat the weakened Balrog - something, that as Gandalf remarked, should have been done ages ago.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:The Balrog is one of the "heroes" available to Servants of Sauron during evil campaign. Appearance reflects the movie version.
