'''Greenholm''' was a town or village of the [[Hobbits]] on the [[Far Downs]], which originally lay on the western borders of [[the Shire]]. It was the home of [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]], who married [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s daughter [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]], and with her founded the [[Fairbairn Family]].  King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] extended the Shire's borders westward to the [[Tower Hills]] in {{SR|1452}}, and ten years later Fastred and Elanor removed from Greenholm into the new [[Westmarch]] of the Shire.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Greenholm'' is open to various interpretations, because the old word ''[[Wiktionary:holm|holm]]'' has a number of possible meanings.

Greenholm possibly represents [[Old English]] ''Greneholm'' in which case it means "green island".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref>
