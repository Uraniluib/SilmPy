'''Dor Daedeloth''' was the land of [[Morgoth]].
==Geography==
Dor Daedeloth was one of the three large regions of western Middle-earth, along with [[Beleriand]] and [[Hithlum]]. It lay all around the fortress of [[Angband]] and on both sides of the [[Ered Engrin]]. Its borders were the [[Ered Wethrin]] to the west, the [[Ered Luin]] to the east, and the [[Dorthonion]],  the [[Pass of Sirion]] and the [[March of Maedhros]] to the south. 

The Ered Engrin, an absolutely unclimbable chain, split the region in two separate parts. The southern part was [[Ard-galen]], the great grassy plain north of [[Beleriand]], later to become the desert of [[Anfauglith]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] had utterly burned it. The northern part was an unnamed region, cold and vast.

==History==
It was here, north of the mountains, that the [[Orcs]] and other creatures of Morgoth lived and bred.<ref name=S13>{{S|13}}</ref>

The march of the [[Noldor]] in early [[First Age]] was halted there, when [[FÃ«anor]] was mortally wounded by [[Balrogs]]. The Noldor then encircled the land (at least in the south), starting the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name=S13/>

==Etymology==
In the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', the name ''Dor Daedeloth'' is translated as "Land of the Shadow of Horror".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> A later version of the name is '''''Dor-Daedeloth''''', translated as "Land of Great Dread".<ref>{{WJ|Index}}, p. 435</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] notes that the name appears only in the chapter ''[[Of the Return of the Noldor]]'' and isn't mentioned again after the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
'''''Daidelos''''' (replaced by ''Dor Daedeloth'') was a name used for the region in early versions of the [[legendarium]].<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, p. 259</ref>

In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s last thoughts the name was to be changed into that of '''''Dor-na-Daerachas''''',<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp. 187, 338</ref> though this form was never used in his writings.
