{{Main|Two Lamps}}
'''Ormal''' was one of the [[Two Lamps]] of the [[Valar]], made by [[Aulë]], filled by [[Varda]] and hallowed by [[Manwë]] in the south of the world while the Valar still dwelt on [[Almaren]]. It was destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] at least five ages before the beginning of the [[First Age]]. <ref>{{S|III}}</ref> The destruction created the [[Sea of Ringil]], south of the [[Sea of Helcar]].<ref>{{SM|A4}}</ref><ref group=note>This Sea is not mentioned in the published [[Silmarillion]].</ref>
==Etymology==
The name apparently means "Lofty gold"<ref>{{HM|Guide}}</ref> or "High-gold".<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref> Obviously it is composed of the [[Elvish]] [[root]]s [[OR]] and [[MAL]].
