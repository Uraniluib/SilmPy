'''Ingwë''' ({{IPA|[ˈiŋʷɡʷe]}}) was the King of the [[Vanyar]] in [[Valinor]] and was reckoned as [[High King of the Elves|High King of all the Elves]].<ref name=princes/> 

==History==
Ingwë was one of the [[Minyar]] born near [[Cuiviénen]]. When [[Oromë]] found the [[Quendi]] and invited them to [[Aman]], Ingwë with [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë Singollo|Elwë]] followed him as ambassadors and travelled to the Blessed Realms. When they returned, they told their peoples about its beauty and bliss and became their leaders during the [[Great March]]. Ingwë was the leader of the [[Vanyar]], the foremost of the clans to follow Oromë, who were the most eager to reach the [[West]], which they did quickly.

After the Great March, Ingwë never returned or set eyes upon [[Middle-earth]] again.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> He lived in [[Tirion]], in the tower called [[Mindon Eldaliéva]], but then he went to [[Taniquetil]] at the feet of [[Manwe]].<ref name=princes>{{S|5}}</ref>

[[Indis]], the second wife of [[Finwe]], was of his close kin.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>
==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Ingwe.mp3|Ardamir}}
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], ''Ingwë'' is said to be a compound of ''[[inga|ing]]'' ("first") + the ending ''[[-wë|-we]]'' ([[Quenya]] "man").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 361, 398 (roots ING and WEG)</ref>

His name also identified the Vanyar, who also called themselves ''Ingwer''; based on the root of his name ''inga'' ([[Q.]]) meaning 'top, highest point'. Their king's proper title was ''Ingwë Ingweron'', "Chief of the chieftains".<ref name=Finwe/>{{rp|340}}

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In early versions of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[legendarium]] (see ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'') Ingwë's name was '''''Inwë'''''.

In part one of ''[[The Lost Tales]]'', "Inwë, referred to in ''[[The Cottage of Lost Play]]'' as 'King of all the Eldar when they dwelt in [[Kôr]]', is the forerunner of Ingwë King of the Vanyar Elves in ''The Silmarillion''." Inwë's son was named as [[Ingil]].<ref>{{LT1|In}}</ref>{{rp|26}}

In drafts for his character, Ingwë had a sister, which would imply that he was not an unbegotten elf and instead a child born from one of the pairings of the original fourteen or their early descendants as the [[Minyar]] clan grew. In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', [[Indis]] is the daughter of King Ingwë's unnamed sister.<ref name=Finwe>{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|343}} In ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', Indis was written as the sister of Ingwë.<ref>{{MR|P3II4}}</ref>{{rp|261}} 

The children of Ingwë and his spouse are not mentioned in ''The Silmarillion''. However, in the words of an early story of Finwë, he said, "'Ingwë and Olwë beget many children in the bliss of Aman.'"<ref name=Earliest>{{MR|P3II2}}</ref>{{rp|206}} And, in that same story, it noted again that Indis was the sister of Ingwë.<ref name=Earliest/>{{rp|207}} 

In these early works, while the other clans are noted as the followers or the people of their leader, only the Vanyar are called "The Children of Ingwë" among other poetic names.<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}</ref>{{rp|164}}
