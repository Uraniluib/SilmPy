'''Firienholt''', originally known as '''Eryn Fuir'''<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 20</ref> was a small forest of [[oaks]] that stood on the borders of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]], about and upon the slopes of the [[Amon Anwar]] (Halifirien).<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

The [[Mering Stream]] arose in the cleft between the Halifirien and the rest of the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]].  It then turned northwest and watered the densest stands of trees in the forest.  The stream marked the precise border between the [[Eastfold]], and the [[Gondor]]ian land of [[Anórien]] and thus part of the woods belonged to either realm.  The great West Road passed through a cutting in the wood to avoid the wet lands to the north.  From the road there was also a path to the summit of the Halifirien maintained by the Beacon-wardens.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) ''Cirion and Eorl'''</ref>

==History==
The road that cut through the northern bounds of the wood had been built by the [[Exiles of Númenor]] soon after the founding of [[Arnor]] and Gondor.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) ''Cirion and Eorl''', note 32</ref>

At the end of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], [[Isildur]] took his nephew [[Meneldil]] and a company of trusted friends on a ride about the borders of Gondor.  Returning from the northern boundary, Isildur came to the Eryn Fuir and had a path made to the summit of Amon Anwar, which was green and treeless.  There they raised a mound for a casket to be the [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb and memorial]] of [[Elendil]].  This spot was chosen because it stood near to the center of the lands claimed by the South Kingdom.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iv) ''The Tradition of Isildur''</ref>

In {{TA|2510}}, after [[Eorl]] and his riders from [[Éothéod]] had saved the Steward [[Cirion]] and the army of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Cirion brought Eorl through the Eryn Fuir to the Amon Anwar to grant him the land of [[Calenardhon]], thus founding the realm of [[Rohan]].<ref name="Cirion"/> With the coming of the [[Rohirrim]], the forest became known as "Firienholt" from the [[Rohan language]].<ref name=VT42/>

In {{TA|2864}} King [[Folca]] hunted and slew the great boar of [[Everholt]] in the Firien Wood, but died of the wounds the beast had given him.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, 13. ''Folca''</ref>

In March of {{TA|3019}} [[Théoden]] and the host of the [[Rohirrim]] passed through Firienholt on their way to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>  Months later the funeral escort of Théoden would travel through the Firienholt on the way back to [[Edoras]].<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>

==Other names==
The older [[Sindarin]] name for the wood had been '''''Eryn Fuir''''', "North Wood" (becoming obsolete with the coming of the [[Rohirrim]]).<ref name=VT42/>  Because of the unnatural silence that lay upon the land in the Common Speech the Firienholt acquired the name "the Whispering Wood".<ref name="Cirion"/>

==Etymology==
''firien holt'' means "mountain wood", though it is rather more commonly referred to simply as the '''''Firien Wood''''', taking its name from Halifirien.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 770</ref>
