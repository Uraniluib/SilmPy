'''Half-orcs''' were among [[Saruman]]'s servants in the late [[Third Age]]. They were large men, lynx-eyed and evil.<ref name=TTIII9>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

Saruman's servants also included creatures known as [[Goblin-men]] who appeared to blend the traits of [[Men]] and [[Orcs]], but they were a different breed.<ref>{{TT|III7}}, [[Gamling]]: ''But these creatures of Isengard, these '''half-orcs''' and '''goblin-men''' that the foul craft of Saruman has bred.''</ref>
==History==
The origin and nature of the half-orcs is unknown. Back in the [[First Age]], [[Men]] could under the domination of [[Morgoth]] or his agents be reduced to a savage stage, and it was possible to mate with Orcs, producing stronger and larger Orcs, or vile and cunning Men.<ref name=myths/> 

Apparently Saruman learned or rediscovered this in the [[Third Age]] and bred Half-orcs and Goblin-men who served him.<ref name=myths/><ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref> 

The [[Squint-eyed Southerner]] from [[Dunland]] was possibly a half-orc.<ref name=Knife>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

Half-orcs were among the [[Dunlendings]] who came to Saruman's banner of the [[White Hand]] in [[Isengard]].<ref name=TTIII9/> Many were counted among the strongest servants of Saruman. The half-orcs mostly perished at [[Battle of the Hornburg]], either before the fortress walls or by the [[Huorns]]. 

More Half-orcs later followed [[Saruman]] into exile, and were among his [[Ruffians]] who occupied [[the Shire]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Concerning the origin of the half-orcs, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] suggested late in his life that: 
{{Blockquote|It became clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of [[Morgoth]] or his agents in a few generations be reduced almost to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or could be made to mate with Orcs, producing new breeds, often larger and more cunning. There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the [[Third Age]], Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.|<ref name=myths>{{MR|P5X}}, pp. 418-9</ref>}}
