'''Úrimë''' ([[Urui]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the eighth month of the year in the [[King's Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] of [[Gondor]], following [[Cermië]], and preceding [[Yavannië]]. In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the fifth month of the year.

''Úrimë'' in the Kings' Reckoning (and for the most part in the Stewards' Reckoning) corresponded to [[Wedmath]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[24 July]] through [[22 August]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
