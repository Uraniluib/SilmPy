The '''W.P. Ker lecture''' was a yearly lecture at the University of Glasgow. It is now a full lectureship. It was instated in 1938 in honour of William Paton Ker, of whom [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] spoke with reverence in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]''. 

On April 15th, [[1953]], Tolkien was given the honour of providing this lecture. It was a discussion of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and the religious themes temptation, adultery and repentance.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 135]], note 2</ref> 

On various websites with a "Tolkien Timeline" (a selection:[http://tolkien.cro.net/tolkien/tolktmln.html][http://gollum.usask.ca/tolkien/era3.html][http://mural.uv.es/jojise/narratime.html][http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=54131761][http://brokenwillsandsavinggrace.blogspot.com/2006/06/timeline-of-jrr-tolkien.html]), the date of this lecture is incorrectly given as [[1933]] (or "circa 1933"). It seems to be based on a misreading and ignorant copy-pasting. Only one site cites a source[http://gollum.usask.ca/tolkien/era3.html], [[William Ready]]'s ''[[The Tolkien Relation]]'', in which it is recorded erronously.<ref>[[William Ready]], ''[[The Tolkien Relation]]'', page 22: ''"He gave the W.P. Ker lecture at Glasgow University in 1933..."''</ref>
