==Etymology==
In the West-lands of [[Middle-earth]] the four cardinal directions were ''[[Númen]], [[Hyarmen]], [[Rómen]],'' and ''Formen'', and they were named in this order, beginning with (and facing) west.  ''Hyarmen'' meant a left-hand region and ''Formen'' meant a right-hand region.<ref name="Names"/>  Thus the word for "north" derives from the [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[PHOR]], meaning "right hand", plus [[MEN]] indicating direction.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, PHOR-</ref>

==Examples==
* [[Formenos]] = "Northern Fortress"
