==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Did you know that the events of The Lord of the Rings are deeply intertwined with the Christian calendar? Or what the Ring, with its awesome and terrible power represents? How do the figures of good and evil in the story reflect those forces in our own lives? J. R. R. Tolkien’s magnum opus has been beloved for generations, selling millions of copies and selling millions more tickets through its award-winning film adaptations. Here, Joseph Pearce, author of Bilbo’s Journey uncovers the rich—and distinctly Christian—meaning just beneath the surface of The Lord of the Rings.}}
