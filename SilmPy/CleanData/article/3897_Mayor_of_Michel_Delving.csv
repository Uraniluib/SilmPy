The '''Mayor of Michel Delving''', sometimes '''Mayor of the Shire''' ([[Sindarin]]: ''Condir i-Drann'')<ref>{{SD|XI2}}</ref> was the elected leader of [[Michel Delving]], the ''de facto'' capital of [[the Shire]]. 

The Mayor was chosen by the [[hobbits]] every seven years at [[Lithe]], during the [[Free Fair]] on the [[White Downs]]. Though the responsibilities of Mayoralty itself amounted to little more than presiding at banquets, the office was attached to that of [[Postmaster]] and [[First Shirriff]].<ref name="OrderingShire">{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>
==History==
By the end of the [[Third Age]], the Mayor of Michel Delving was "the only real official in the Shire", so he was commonly known as the '''Mayor of the Shire'''<ref name="OrderingShire"/>

In {{FoA|13}} ([[Shire Reckoning|S.R.]] 1434) the Mayor of Michel Delving, along with the Thain and the [[Master of Buckland]], was made a Counsellor of the newly re-established [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] by [[High King of the Dúnedain|King]] [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref name="AppBLater">{{App|B5}}</ref>

===Mayors of Michel Delving===
The poem [[Perry-the-Winkle]] mentions "[[Pott the Mayor]]" in Michel Delving, but it is not clear if this character is based on an actual Hobbit who was a Mayor.<ref>{{AB|Perry}}</ref> 

[[Will Whitfoot]] was the Mayor of Michel Delving during the War of the Ring. An old and fat hobbit, he was largely regarded as a harmless figure of fun,<ref>{{FR|I10}}</ref> but showed his mettle when in {{TA|3019}} he was one of the few hobbits that protested [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho Sackville-Baggins']] takeover of the Shire on behalf of [[Saruman]], and in return was imprisoned in the [[Lockholes]] by Lotho's [[Ruffians]].<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|VI8}}</ref> He was released following the [[Scouring of the Shire]], and [[Frodo Baggins]] acted as his Deputy until he had recovered.<ref name="GreyHavens">{{RK|VI9}}</ref>

After Whitfoot, [[Samwise Gamgee]] served an unprecedented seven consecutive terms as Mayor, starting in {{FoA|6}} and ending in {{FoA|55}} ([[Shire Reckoning|S.R.]] 1427&ndash;1476). [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom Cotton]] briefly acted as his Deputy.<ref name="AppBLater"/>
