'''Drogo Baggins''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]]. He was the father of [[Frodo Baggins]].

==History==
Drogo Baggins was the second child, and oldest son, of [[Fosco Baggins]] and [[Ruby Bolger]], born in {{SR|1308}}. He married [[Primula Brandybuck]], and had one child, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 

A regular [[Shire-hobbit]], fond of good food, he seemed to adopt the curious customs of the [[Bucklanders]], like boating. This was the cause of his irregular death, drowning in a boating accident with his wife Primula. Frodo was still very young and he was taken under the custody of his uncle, [[Rorimac Brandybuck]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name ''Drogo'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Droga''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>
