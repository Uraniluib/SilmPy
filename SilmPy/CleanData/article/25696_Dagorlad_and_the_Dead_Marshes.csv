INTRODUCTION

South of the Wilderland and north of Mordor lies a widely varying landscape stretching from the scarps and cliffs of the western Emyn Muil through the swamps and marshes of Nindalf to the bare plain known as the Dagorlad (S. "Battle Plain"). Once these lands were pleasant enough, in the way of wild places, although they were never much favored by settlers. The wetlands were filled with all manner of waterfowl and alive with the songs of frogs and blackbirds. The region's waters gleamed with fish, and deer grazed the marsh grasses, bothered only by the hunting expeditions of the scattered tribes of Marshmen. These folk were almost always left alone and ignored by the wars and battles which raged about them, for their watery lands have always been too difficult for an army to cross with any speed, and treacherous indeed for those not born of the marshes.

Instead, travelers have always gone by way of the broad plain before the dark gateway into Mordor. This expanse was once covered with wild grains and other grasses which quickly sprang up to hide the remains of the great war fought here at the end of the Second Age. Grouse pecked and nested there, and wild cattle grazed. Although unsettled by Men, these lands were peaceful and fruitful until a few hundred years ago, when the Shadow began to descend upon them once more.
