The '''Square of the Palace''', alternately called the '''Square of the King''', '''King's Square''' (also '''King's hall, palace, tower, fountain'''), and '''Place of the King''', was the great court of King [[Turgon]] of [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{HM|IX}}, pp. 254, 405</ref>  It was located in the center of the city, and is described thoroughly in the [[Fall of Gondolin]].  There were fountains before the doors, and two trees, [[Glingal]] and [[Belthil]], of gold and silver.  The fountains shot twenty-seven fathoms into the air, and white birds dwelt in the trees, singing beautiful songs.  The tower of the palace was the tallest in the city, and the palace behind was white and beautiful.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, ''passim''</ref>
