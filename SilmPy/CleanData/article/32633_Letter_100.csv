==Summary==
Christopher had returned from South Africa and was stationed with the R.A.F. in Shropshire.  He hoped to transfer to the Fleet Air Arm.  J.R.R. Tolkien would have been comforted if Christopher could escape from the R.A.F. and get the transfer with a re-commission.  Tolkien could not say how much he loathed the Third Service while he felt admiration, gratitude, and pity for the young men caught in it.  The aeroplane of war was the real villain and nothing could lessen his grief that Christopher had any connexion with it.  His sentiments were those that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] would have had if he had discovered some [[Hobbits]] learning to ride [[Nazg√ªl]]-birds "for the liberation of [[the Shire]]".  Everything about British or American imperialism in the Far East filled him with regret and disgust, and he had no glimmer of patriotism for the remaining war.  Were he a free man he would contribute neither a penny nor his son to it.  At least, he said, the Americo-Russian War would not break out for a year yet.
