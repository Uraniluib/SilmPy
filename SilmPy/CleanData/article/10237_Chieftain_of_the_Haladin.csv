Shortly after arriving the Haladin were attacked by [[Orcs]] and [[Haleth]], daughter of the recently slain Chieftain, was responsible for the survival of her people. Thereafter, the Chieftain of the Haladin became a hereditary title.

In honor of her memory, the Haladin would rename themselves the [[House of Haleth]], and Chieftain of the Haladin would become the Chieftain of the House of Haleth and Warden ([[Halad]]) of Brethil.
