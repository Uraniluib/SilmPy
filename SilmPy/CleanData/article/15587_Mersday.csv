'''Mersday''' was the sixth day of the week in the [[Shire Calendar]]. It represented the [[Númenórean]] day ''[[Oraearon]]'', dedicated to the [[Sea]].<ref name=cal>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>

After the reform of [[Isengrim Took II]],<ref name=cal/> dates such as [[1 March]] and [[1 September]] always fell on Mersday.

==Etymology==
''Mersday'' represents an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form "Meresdei", a word preserved in the [[Yellowskin]].<ref name=cal/>

''Mersday'' is translated as Thursday in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', however as it was one day before the chief day of the week, it rather corresponded to our Saturday. For this reason there was one exception, and in the poem ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'', Mersday was translated as "Saturday" instead of Thursday.<ref name=cal/><ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>
