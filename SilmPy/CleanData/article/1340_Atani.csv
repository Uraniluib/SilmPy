'''Atani''' was a [[Quenya]] name for [[Men]],<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> and especially the [[Men]] of the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]]. However it was seldomly applied to the Men east of the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> 
==Etymology==
''Atan'' pl. ''Atani'' is glossed as "Second People" in the Silmarillion Index. (cf: ''[[atta]]'' "two").

The equivalents of [[Sindarin]] are ''[[Adan]]'' pl. ''Edain''.

The word appears in names such as [[Núnatani]], [[Hróatani]], [[Atanalcar]], [[Atanamir]], [[Atanatar]] and [[Atanatari]].
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a draft to the text ''[[Of Dwarves and Men]]'', [[Tolkien]] considered that the word is derived from the [[Taliska|language]] of the [[House of Bëor|Folk of Bëor]], but as [[Christopher Tolkien]] noted, it contradicted the final version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>{{fact}}<!--page ref-->
