<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The end of the ring, the return of the king,
A new age has come to the land!
The end of the ring, the return of the king,
He shall rule with a true healing hand!

The quest is done, the battle won,
And all have lost in the winning.
Oft hope is born when all's forlorn,
And there's a new beginning.

We will have the courage not to fail!
The bearer of the ring we hail!
Praise them! praise them!
Praise them with great praise!
Praise them with great praise!

The end of the ring, the return of the king,
A new age has come to the land!
The end of the ring, the return of the king,
He shall rule with a true healing hand!
Ah!
