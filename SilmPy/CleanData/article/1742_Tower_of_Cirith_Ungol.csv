The '''Tower of Cirith Ungol''' ([[Sindarin]], "Spider's cleft") was a bastion in the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] in the [[Ephel Dúath]] on the western border of [[Mordor]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] was taken into the Tower and searched by [[Orcs]], then rescued by [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] before they descended onto the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]].

==History==
The Tower of Cirith Ungol was originally a watchtower of [[Gondor]], guarding the high pass and made by the Gondorians some time after the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]]. Its principal purpose was to defend [[Ithilien]] from attacks from [[Sauron]]'s remaining servants. It also served to stop Sauron's servants from returning to Mordor.<ref name=Tower>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

Gondor occupied the fortress until {{TA|1636}} when the [[Great Plague]] killed large parts of Gondor's population.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> After the plague, Gondor never again manned the Tower of Cirith Ungol and evil was allowed to return to Mordor. Similar fates suffered the mountain fortress of [[Durthang]] in north-western Mordor, and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] at the [[Morannon]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

===[[War of the Ring]]===
On [[13 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}, Orcs from the Tower, under the command of [[Shagrat]], captured Frodo after finding his unconscious body in the Pass below.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> They carried his body through the [[Under-way]] and into the [[Undergate]] that, besides the main gate, was the only entrance to the Tower. After overhearing Shagrat and [[Gorbag]] talking, Sam realized that Frodo had only been paralysed by [[Shelob]] and not killed as he had first thought. Sam was too late to gain entry through the Undergate and knocked himself senseless trying to get in.<ref>{{TT|IV10}}</ref>

When Sam awoke on [[14 March]] he determined to enter the main gate to find Frodo.<ref name=Great/> Mastering his fears, Sam came to the main gate and was halted by the malevolent will of the [[Two Watchers]], stone statues flanking either side of the gate, topped with three vulture-faces each and endowed with spirits of evil. Holding aloft the [[Phial of Galadriel]] Sam overcame their will and thrust through the gate, but the Watchers let forth a shrill cry that was echoed by a harsh bell above.

In the meantime, the orcs had searched Frodo. When they found the [[Mithril#The Mithril Coat|shirt]] of ''[[mithril]]'' mail Frodo was wearing a quarrel over the spoils erupted. A contingent of orcs from [[Minas Morgul]] led by [[Gorbag]] fought Shagrat and his company for possession of the mithril. The fighting spread throughout the tower and most of the orcs on both sides were killed, making it possible for Sam to proceed and rescue Frodo. Although Sam fought Shagrat the Orc got away, bearing Frodo's gear to [[Barad-dûr]]. Sam finally found Frodo in the topmost chamber after killing [[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga]]. Sam returned the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] to Frodo, dressed him and gathered food and gear, and they left the tower. On the way out their use of the Phial caused the gateway to crumble behind them.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

==Appearance==
The Tower stood against the mountain face near the highest ridge of the Ephel Dúath. From the west only the round, topmost turret was visible. The turret was supported by three great tiers that jutted out in a sharp angle, pointing eastward into Mordor. The lowest tier was encircled by a battlemented wall that enclosed a narrow court. The main gate pierced the south-eastern wall. A broad road ran along a precipice from the gate down to a southward bend and down to the road through the [[Morgul Pass]]. A narrower path led up from the gate by stairs to Cirith Ungol.<ref name=Tower/>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] made three drawings of the Tower where only the turret is visible<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]], pp. 171, 172, 173</ref>, and one with the entire bastion <ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]], p. 174</ref>. This last picture depicts the Tower in an earlier stage of writing, with four tiers.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:In Scene 43, "The Choices of Master Samwise", Frodo first sees the turret at the top of the tower through a narrow cleft, with a single red light glowing. Frodo is stung by [[Shelob]], Sam fights and defeats the spider, and then Shagrat and orcs come upon Frodo's body. There is no Under-way or Undergate; the Orcs carry the body up the path with Sam following behind.

:In Scene 58, "The Tower of Cirith Ungol" (Extended Version), the view zooms into a window of the turret to show Frodo, still unconscious, lying on the floor while Shagrat and Gorbag go through his possessions. Frodo awakes while the two Orcs find the Mithril coat. Gorbag wants the coat for himself while Shagrat insists it goes to Sauron. A fight breaks out that soon envelopes all of the Orcs in the Tower. As the Orcs slaughter each other, Sam approaches the gate and spies the Two Watchers. The scene jumps to Sam inside the gate without showing the contest of wills. Sam climbs the inside of the tower and his shadow scares four Orcs descending the stairs. Sam kills three of the Orcs while the fourth escapes with the Mithril coat. In the turret room Frodo struggles to free himself, attracting the attention of Shagrat, who threatens to bleed him "like a stuck pig". However, the point of [[Sting]] suddenly pops out of Shagrat's chest as Sam kills the Orc. Sam reluctantly returns the Ring to Frodo and they dress themselves as Orcs before they leave the Tower. Their escape past the Two Watchers is not shown.

:The Tower's appearance in the film closely matches the text, a tiered bastion of dark stone with a turret bearing a red light at the top.
