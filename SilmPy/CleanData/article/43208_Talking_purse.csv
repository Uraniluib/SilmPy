The '''talking purse''' was the purse of the [[Trolls|troll]] [[William]]. When [[Bilbo Baggins]] tried to pick the purse from William's pocket, the purse suddenly squeaked "Ere, 'oo are you?". William was thus warned of the pickpocketing and captured Bilbo.<ref name=H2>{{H|2}}</ref>

The size of the purse was huge: it is told to have been "as big as a bag to Bilbo". Apparently "Trolls' purses" were known for their mischief.<ref name=H2/>

==Background==

[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have suggested that the purse was perhaps not made by trolls, but that it was stolen and, because of it ability to speak (like the sword [[Gurthang]]), of [[Dwarves|dwarvish]] or [[Elves|elvish]] origin.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=141437|articlename=Talking Wallet?|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.minastirith.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=3;t=000199|articlename=The talking purse|dated=|website=[http://www.minastirith.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi Minas Tirith Forums]|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=580638|articlename=The talking purse - anything in the mythology to explain what it is?|dated=|website=[http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/ The One Ring Forums]|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref>
