'''''-mar''''' is a [[Quenya]] suffix that has three meanings.
==-mar<sup>1</sup>==
'''-mar''', pl. '''-mardi''', means dwelling.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p.64</ref> Although [[Angmar]] is a [[Sindarin]] name, the Quenya suffix '''-mar''' and the Sindarin suffix '''-bar''' come from the same root, [[MBAR]].
==-mar<sup>2</sup>==
Used for the 'residence' of a family, the whole area occupied or owned by a family or 'kindred'. Also used with a defining genitive or in genitival compound. When added to a personal name (e.g. ''[[Ingwemar]]'') it signified the 'residence' of a family of which the 'head' was the named person. After the name of a people of 'kindred' (e.g. ''[[Eldamar]]'') it referred to the whole area occupied or owned by them, in which their dwellings or 'houses' were distributed and in which they were settled and were 'at home' as long as they remained as united people.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp.106-7</ref>
==-mar<sup>3</sup>==
(from [[Root]] [[MBAR]] settle) Used for a region settled/ inhabited by a people, community or group.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p.164</ref> An example would be [[Eldamar]] ([[elda]] + [[mar]]), which means "Elvenhome".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p.20</ref>
