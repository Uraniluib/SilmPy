'''Cows''', also known by the archaic plural '''Kine''' and occasionally as '''Oxen''', were pasture animals in [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Cows were domesticated for farm use in most of [[Middle-earth]]. They produced milk, which was used as a beverage in [[Gondor]],<ref>{{HM|RK}}, "[[The Siege of Gondor]]"</ref> and [[the Shire]].<ref>{{HM|H}}, "[[An Unexpected Party]]"</ref> Being generally stronger than [[horses]], cows also pulled the heavier wagons and wains in Middle-earth.<ref name="MT">{{HM|RK}}, "[[Minas Tirith (chapter)|Minas Tirith]]"</ref>

Yet still, there were undomesticated oxen. The wild-oxen of the East were, according to legend, descended from the [[Kine of Araw]], the herd of [[Oromë]].<ref name="AA">{{HM|AA}}, "The Realms in Exile"</ref> [[Vorondil the Hunter]] hunted them in the far fields of [[Rhûn]], and of their horns he made the [[Great Horn]] of Gondor, which served as an heirloom to the House of Stewards until its destruction.<ref name="MT"/>

==Inspiration==
Cows are a major source of food even in today's world. Their use as farm animals seems little more than logical. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spent most of his life in [[Oxford|'''Ox'''ford]], and cows would also play a role in other stories, such as ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', where [[the Giant]] steps on [[Farmer Giles]]' favourite cow, [[Galathea]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'' (2008 edition), "[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]"</ref>

The white oxen of [[Rhûn]] were likened by Tolkien to an ''[[wikipedia:Aurochs|aurochs]]''<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 265</ref>, a bovine species common in the ancient and medieval world until its extinction.

==Etymology==
An "elvish" word for "bull" is ''[[mundo]]''.<ref>{{L|342}}</ref> The [[Sundocarme|Root]] MBUD, which lists among its derivatives a [[Quenya]] word ''mundo'' meaning "snout, nose, cape",<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root MBUD</ref> could perhaps be related to ''mundo''.

In [[Qenya]], the word for "ox" is ''[[yakko]]'' or ''yako'', "cow" is ''[[yaksi]]'' or ''yakse''. In [[Noldorin|Gnomish]], "milch cow" is ''[[gach]]'', "cow" is ''[[gacha]]'', and "a yoke ox - bullock" is ''gagron''. Other Gnomish names are ''mûs'' or ''mui'' ("cow"); ''muir'' ("heifer"); ''[[mû]]'' ("ox"), ''muin'' ("kine, cattle"); and ''[[mugli]]'' ("calf").<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 105</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 36, 58</ref>

In Tolkien's juvenile language [[Nevbosh]], the word for cow is ''woc'', which is both the reverse of ''cow'', and an alteration of the French word ''vache''.<ref>[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/nevbosh.htm Nevbosh article] in [[Ardalambion]]</ref>
