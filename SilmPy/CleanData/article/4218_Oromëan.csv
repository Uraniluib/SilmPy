In an older version of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s conception of the [[Languages]] of [[Middle-earth]] as expounded in the ''[[Lhammas]]'', '''Oromëan''' is the language phylum to which all [[Elvish]] languages, such as [[Qenya]], [[Kornoldorin]] and [[Ilkorin]], belong. It is there contrasted with [[Aulëan]], the language phylum of [[Khuzdul]], the language of the [[Dwarves]].

The Oromëan languages are so named because their ancestral language supposedly derives from the speech of [[Oromë]], the [[Valar|Vala]] of the Forest, who was the first of the Valar to meet the [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>

This concept was later dropped and it is mentioned that when Oromë found the Elves they already had  devised by themselves [[Primitive Elvish]].
