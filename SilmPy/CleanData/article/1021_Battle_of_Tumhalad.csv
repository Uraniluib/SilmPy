The '''Battle of Tumhalad''' was the last battle of the Elves of [[Nargothrond]] against the Forces of Morgoth. It was fought on the plain of [[Tumhalad]] between the [[Narog]] and its tributary, the [[Ginglith]].

==Prelude==
Nargothrond was the hidden stronghold of [[Finrod Felagund]] who built it as a safe haven for the Noldor against the forces of [[Morgoth]].

[[Túrin]], was led there by [[Gwindor]] who was of Nargothrond and during his stay there Túrin becoming mighty among the Elves and grew in favour of the King, [[Orodreth]] becoming his chief counsellor and ruled all matters of war. Túrin had no liking of their manner of warfare of stealth and ambush<ref>{{S|21}}</ref> preferring battle in the open so the Noldor built a mighty bridge over the [[Narog]] for swifter passage. A great store of weapons were made and the Elves forsook their secrecy and went into open war.

Five years since the arrival of Túrin in Nargothrond, they were visited by [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] of the people of [[Finarfin]] whom have dwelt with [[Angrod]]. They gave warning of a great gathering of Orcs about [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth|Sauron's Isl]]e<ref>{{CH|11}}, pp. 173</ref> and a message from the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]] to shut their doors and go not abroad.

Túrin rebuffed the Vala's warning and counselled Orodreth to meet them in the field instead and in the autumn of the same year Morgoth sent forth his host of Orcs with [[Glaurung]] at its head.

==The Battle==
The host of Nargothrond went forth with Orodreth leading along with Túrin and [[Gwindor]]. The host of Orcs were much larger than anticipated, none could withstand the assault of the dragon [[Glaurung]] except for Túrin and his [[dwarf-mask]] and the Elves were driven back into the field of Tumahalad.

In-between [[Narog]] and [[Ginglith]] the host of Nargothrond was defeated. King Orodreth was slain and Gwindor was mortally wounded and died later.

==Aftermath==
Túrin fled the battle with Gwindor while the remaining few Elves that did escape fled to Nargothrond, some to [[Doriath]] and possibly to the [[Isle of Balar]].

After defeat of the Elven host Glaurung turned towards the stronghold inevitably [[Fall of Nargothrond|sacking the city]].
