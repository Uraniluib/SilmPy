'''Rankin/Bass''' was a film production company founded by [[Jules Bass]] and [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] in 1960. The company focused on television specials. In 1977 Rankin/Bass produced an animated version of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]], the final book of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rankin/Bass could not adapt the first two books of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as the animation rights for the two books were held by [[Saul Zaentz]], producer of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s cartoon adaptation of the first half of the trilogy, entitled [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]].
