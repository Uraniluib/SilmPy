'''The Ruins of Osgiliath: The Complete Tales of the First City of Gondor''' is a collection of stories set in [[Middle-earth]], written by [[Alex Lewis]] and illustrated by [[Ruth Lacon]]. The book was first issued in a series of 3 booklets for members of [[The Tolkien Society]] in 1990, created to fund a quality present for Miss [[Priscilla Tolkien]] during the 1992 Tolkien Society Conference, celebrating Tolkien's 100th birthday. Like ''[[The Tale of Gondolin]]'', the project was not backed by the [[Tolkien Estate]].

The book was released in [[2005]]<ref>"A note from Ruth Lacon" in ADC Art & Books: catalogue 2009/10, p.30. However, according to [[Pieter Collier]] of Tolkienlibrary.com, the first printing of the book was made in 1995 (see [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/dmiller/000261.htm this external link]).</ref> and was limited to 100 copies worldwide.
