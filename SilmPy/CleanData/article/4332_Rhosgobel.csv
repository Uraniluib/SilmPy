'''Rhosgobel''' was the "old home" of [[Radagast]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> The house is said to have been located between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Old Forest Road]], on the western borders of [[Mirkwood]]<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 4</ref> and near its southern borders.<ref>{{H|7}}</ref><ref>{{TI|MII}}, p.305</ref><ref group=note>This location for Rhosgobel appears on the first map of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]''. A dot and the name are near the center of square L-13 on Map II, placing Rhosgobel east and a little south of the [[Gladden Fields]].</ref>

After the [[Council of Elrond]], some scouts from [[Rivendell]] passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast was not there.<ref>{{FR|South}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Rhosgobel'', glossed as "russet village or 'town' (enclosure)",<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 241</ref> is evidently a compound of ''[[rhosc]]'' ("brown") and ''[[gobel]]'' ("walled house or village, town").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} pp. 380, 385</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/lh-rh.htm|articlename=On ''LH'' and ''RH''|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=9 April 2012}}</ref> The name of the house was perhaps a reference to its resident, the Brown Wizard.
