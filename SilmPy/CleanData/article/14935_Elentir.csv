'''Elentir''' was a character that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] created and then abandoned during the writing of the ''[[Akallabêth]]''.  Tolkien originally wrote that [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]], the daughter of [[Tar-Palantir]], was forced to marry her cousin, [[Ar-Pharazôn]].  After completing and then expanding a second version of the ''Akallabêth'' Tolkien toyed with a different version of their relationship and introduced Elentir, the son of [[Númendil]] and the brother of [[Amandil]] as part of this new concept.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 159</ref>  In four separate texts, labeled ''(a)'' through ''(d)'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] set forth the "rise and fall" of Elentir:

* In text ''(a)'', Elentir was in love with Zimrahil (an early name for Míriel) but she became infatuated by Pharazôn's beauty and wealth.  Despite the laws of [[Númenor]] the two first cousins married.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 160</ref>
* In text ''(b)'', Elentir was betrothed to Zimrahil when she turned to Pharazôn.  This text was written in very poor handwriting so the course of the story was obscured.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 161</ref>
* In text ''(c)'', Elentir loved Zimrahil, she loved him, and they were about to be betrothed when...  At this point this abandoned text ended but it appeared that soon Zimrahil would have turned to Pharazôn.<ref name="Page162">{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 162</ref>
* In text ''(d)'', Elentir and the story of Zimrahil's love for Pharazôn are absent.<ref name="Page162"/>

Christopher concluded that ''(b)'' and ''(c)'' were not expansions on ''(a)'' but simply repetitions, and that ''(d)'' represented a final abandonment of the alternate version of the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn.  With a return to the original concept of a forced marriage there was no need for the character Elentir and so he vanished.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 163</ref>
