'''Trees''' were the tallest of the ''[[olvar]]'' of [[Yavanna]], plentiful throughout [[Middle-earth]] and formed [[:Category:Forests|forests]]. Although the trees were ''olver'', some trees were animate, like the [[Huorns]]. There was also the [[:Portal:Characters|race]] known as [[Ents]], herders of the trees. 

Trees, being living things, were never regarded as gender-neutral in the [[Eldarin|High-elven tongue]].<ref>{{PE|14}}, pp. 44, 73</ref>

{{quote|During the first year of the boy’s [Tolkien’s] life Arthur Tolkien made a small grove of cypresses, firs, and cedars. Perhaps this had something to do with the deep love of trees that would develop in Ronald.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]}}

Trees were of special importance to Tolkien - in his short story "[[Leaf by Niggle]]", which in a sense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the protagonist, Niggle, spends his life painting a single Tree.
