The '''Bow of Bregor''' belonged to [[Bregor]], the [[Lord of Ladros]], and remained a heirloom of the [[House of Bëor]].

The House was decimated, but the Bow somehow survived into the [[Second Age]] and the [[Edain]] brought it to [[Númenor]]. It was kept as a heirloom of the [[Kings of Númenor]], until its [[Downfall of Númenor|downfall]], when it was lost during the deluge.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, Note 2</ref>
