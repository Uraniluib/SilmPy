'''Mîm''' was one of the last [[Petty-dwarves]].

==History==
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Mîm the dwarf.jpg|[[Anke Eißmann]] - ''Mîm the dwarf''|thumb|left]]Mîm lived with his two sons at [[Amon Rûdh]] in middle [[Beleriand]], where he kept a secret treasury. During [[Túrin]]'s time with the [[Gaurwaith|Outlaws]], Mîm and sons were seen as they snuck past the outlaws carrying heavy sacks. Mîm was captured, and arrows were shot at his sons '''[[Ibun]]''' and '''[[Khîm]]'''.

In exchange for his life, Mîm was forced to lead the outlaws to his secret halls in Amon Rûdh. There, it turned out Khîm had been killed by an arrow, and Túrin repenting offered his service to Mîm. For this reason Mîm tolerated the outlaws, and eventually even took a liking to Túrin.

When [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] arrived at Amon Rûdh, Mîm was angry: he hated [[Elves]], especially the [[Sindar]]. Nevertheless he had to tolerate the Elf in his halls.<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref> After he betrayed Amon Rûdh to [[Morgoth]] under the promise that Túrin would not be harmed, Mîm somehow escaped, but it seems Ibun was killed by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref> In {{FA|499}} Mîm made his way to [[Nargothrond]] after Túrin had killed [[Glaurung]], and he took the treasure for his own.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p.257</ref>

In {{FA|502|n}},<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p.258</ref> [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]], who had seen all that had happened to Túrin with Morgoth's eyes, came across Mîm in Nargothrond, and killed him, deeming him partially responsible for Túrin's fate. With his dying words Mîm cursed the treasure. Húrin's band brought the treasure of Nargothrond to [[Doriath]], where eventually the gold was a reason for the [[Second Kinslaying]] and the death of [[Thingol]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

== Other Versions of the Legendarium ==
In earlier versions of the Silmarillion as detailed in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, Mîm was a much more evil character, who actively betrayed Túrin.<ref>{{CH|8}}, footnote, p. 148</ref> But as [[Dwarves]] gradually changed in Tolkien's writings from evil Orc-like beings to the Dwarves they later became, Mîm's character was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true villain, but almost a tragic character in his own right.
