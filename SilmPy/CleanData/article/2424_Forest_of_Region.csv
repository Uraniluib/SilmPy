The '''Forest of Region''' was a forest, primarily made up of [[holly]]. Early in the [[First Age]] the [[Tatyar]] rested in its woods.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref> 

Populated by [[Sindar]], Region formed the southern and greater part of the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. It was bounded by the rivers [[Aros]] and [[Esgalduin]] south of [[Dor Dínen]], and the [[Girdle of Melian]]. [[Menegroth]] lay in that forest.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Region'' is given as [[Doriathrin]]<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>. The base is the word ''[[reg]]'' "holly tree", with perhaps the toponymical ending ''[[-nd|-ion]]'' *"holly-land" or a plural genitive ending ''[[-ion]]'' (as in [[Quenya]]), having the meaning *"(Land) of Hollies".<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/doriath.htm|articlename=Doriathrin}}, entries '''regorn''', '''-ion''' where both possibilities are mentioned</ref>

Note that the name is unrelated to the English word "region (of land)", and thus is to be pronounced with a hard ''g''.<ref>{{App|Pronunciation}}</ref>
