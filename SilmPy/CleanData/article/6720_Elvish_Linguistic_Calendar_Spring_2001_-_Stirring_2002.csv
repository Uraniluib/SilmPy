The '''Elvish Linguistic Calendar Spring 2001 - Stirring 2002''' is a downloadable calendar by [[Gwaith-i-Phethdain]] and the [[Polish Tolkien Society]]. The calendar features nine illustrations by [[Karolina Stopa]], [[Małgorzata Pudlik]], Gildor Inglorion, and [[Ryszard Derdzinski]].

From Ryszard Derdzinski's website:
:Its full title is Elvish Linguistic Calendar because it contains 8 short texts in Quenya with commentaries and the 'reconstructed words' dictionaries and seasonal Quenya glossaries...All the dates in the Middle-earth calendars are given in the Fëanorian numerals. The calendar contains the Foreword explaining the Elvish numerals and all the calendar arrangements and the Note on the Calculations by Boris Shapiro. It can be a nice item in your Tolkien collection or calendar collection.
