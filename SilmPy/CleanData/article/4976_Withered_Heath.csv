The '''Withered Heath''' was a [[Dragons|dragon]]-infested valley in the eastern [[Grey Mountains]] in northern [[Rhovanion]].

==Description==
The Withered Heath was a long narrow valley in the eastern part of the [[Grey Mountains]], where they forked into two thin ranges.<ref>{{H|WM}}</ref><ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> On the floor of this long east-west valley between the mountains was a [[Wikipedia:Heath_(habitat)|heath]], burned and blackened by its inhabitants, being the breeding-ground of [[dragons]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref>

==History==
At one time the dragons of the Heath had infested the Grey Mountains and the lands beyond, and in the closing decades of the [[Third Age]], the Dragon [[Smaug]] terrorised the inhabitants of the north.<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref> Smaug was the last of the great dragons, but lesser members of his kind remained.

==Other version of the legendarium==
In one of the earliest versions of the legendarium, the ''Withered Heath'' was the name of the [[Heath of the Sky-roof]], a location of [[Tol Eressëa]] near [[Tavrobel]], after a great battle between [[Men]] who came to the island.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>

In the manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bladorthin (the pre-cursor to [[Gandalf]]) says that the Withered Heath is "''where the Great Dragons used to live''".<ref>{{HM|MB}}, pp. 9, 20</ref>
