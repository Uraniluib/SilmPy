'''Hawks''' were the swiftest birds of prey, smaller than [[Eagles]], but just as sharp-eyed. 

==History==
[[Spirits (creatures)|Spirits]] in the shapes of hawks and eagles were the servants of [[Manwë|Manwë Súlimo]], continually flying over [[Middle-earth]] to gather information for their master.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> Above many flocks of ''[[crebain]]'', [[Aragorn]] noticed hawks, flying high in the sky, during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}, "[[The Ring goes South]]"</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] noted that one of two possible readings for the unintelligible entry [[PHI]] in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' could be "hawk" (the other being "haste").<ref name="Etym">{{LR|Etymologies}}, [[Sundocarme|Root]] [[PHI]]</ref> [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Patrick H. Wynne]] argue that "hawk" is the more likely reading, especially given the onomatopoeic suitability of the form of the base to the cry of a hawk, and the possible relation to the root [[PHILIK]], "small bird".<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 9</ref> The [[Quenya]] word for "hawk" would then be ''fion'', plural ''fiondi''.<ref name="Etym"/>

In a linguistic manuscript dating from the 1930s, appears the [[Qenya]] gloss ''haro'' ("hawk").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 8</ref>
