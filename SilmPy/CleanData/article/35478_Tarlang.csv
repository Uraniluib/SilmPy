'''Tarlang''' was a legendary [[Giants|giant]].<ref name=RC>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', omitted entry quoted in [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', pp. 536-7</ref>

==History==
According to folklore, Tarlang belonged to a group of giants who in "ancient days" were building the [[White Mountains]] in order to prevent [[Men]] from entering the giants' land close by the [[Beleriand|Sea]]. While carrying a heavy load of rocks, Tarlang stumbled and fell on his face, fatally breaking his neck. His corpse was used by the other giants to finish the wall: his remants formed the pass [[Tarlang's Neck]] (from the break in his neck), [[Dol Tarlang]] (consisting of his head), and [[Cûl Veleg]] and [[Cûl Bîn]] (remnants of his load of rocks).<ref name=RC/>

==Etymology==

The name ''Tarlang'' is glossed as "stiff neck", consisting of ''[[tarch]]'' ("stiff, tough") + ''[[lang]]'' ("neck").<ref name=RC/><ref name=DW>{{webcite|author=[[Didier Willis]]|articleurl=http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html|articlename=Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary|dated=|website=[http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com]|accessed=20 February 2013}}</ref>
