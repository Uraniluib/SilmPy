The '''Assaults on Hithlum''' were a series of minor battles in the [[Wars of Beleriand]].  

About a hundred years after the [[Dagor Aglareb]], Hithlum seemed to the [[Enemy]] an easier target than the realm of [[Maedhros]]. A small number of [[Orcs]] went south to the [[Firth of Drengist]] and turned to the east. But spies saw them in time, and [[Fingon]], using but a small part of his people, fell from the hills on them at the head of the Firth to drive them back into the sea. This victory proved to the Enemy that the Orcs were inadequate against the [[Noldor]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

It occurred seven years after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] when [[Morgoth]] sent an invasion of [[Hithlum]].  It began with a bitter attack through the passes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] and a siege of [[Eithel Sirion]].  At the fortress [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] fell, pierced by an arrow.  [[Húrin]] replaced his father in command, and drove the Orcs from the mountains and across the sands of [[Anfauglith]].

However, an army also came from [[Angband]] into Hithlum from the north, leading to battle upon the plains.  Initially King [[Fingon]] was outnumbered and hard-pressed until [[Círdan]] sent a task force up the Firth of [[Drengist]] which fell upon the Orcs from the west.  This broke the Orc-host, which fled to the [[Iron Mountains]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>
