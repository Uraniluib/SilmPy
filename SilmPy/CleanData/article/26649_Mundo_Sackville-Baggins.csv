'''Mundo Sackville-Baggins''' is a character created specifically for [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]. 

He was mistakenly identified by the [[Blackwolds]] to be the Hobbit carrying the Ring<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref> that they were looking for and taken to [[Bree-land]] in hopes of selling him to the [[Nazg没l]]. He was rescued by [[Strider]] and [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]], in which Amdir was stabbed by a Nazg没l. After the Nazg没l was driven off, they fled to [[Archet]] to recover. Shortly after, Archet was attacked by the Blackwolds and burned down. In the wake, Amdir was taken by the Nazg没l to become a [[Cargul]].

When he returned to [[the Shire]] he requested compensation for his treatment at Archet from the Mayor of [[Michel Delving]], [[Will Whitfoot]].<ref>{{VGC|SAP}}</ref>

He is the nephew of [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]].
