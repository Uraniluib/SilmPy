'''The Last Alliance of Elves and Men''' was formed in {{SA|3430|n}} of the [[Second Age]] in response to the threat of conquest by the Dark Lord [[Sauron]].<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}</ref>

==History==
Sauron had been contending with the [[Elves]] for mastery of Middle-earth for over 1200 years. Fearing the establishment of the powerful kingdoms in exile &mdash; [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] &mdash; by his hated enemies, the [[Dúnedain]], Sauron launched a pre-emptive attack on Gondor in {{SA|3429}}.<ref name=SA/>

In response, [[Elendil]], High King of the Dúnedain, formed an alliance with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to repel Sauron's assault. [[Durin's Folk]] also aided Elendil and Gil-galad. It is said that Elendil bound the Alliance with an oath and invoked the name of [[Eru]] to witness it.<ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Eru's name was very rarely invoked in oaths, and among the [[Númenóreans]] it was held that only the King could call upon Him. This would happen again only thousands of years later during the [[Oath of Cirion]].<ref name=Cirion/> 

The hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil met at [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]] and marched towards Imladris where they camped for three years, forging armour and making plans whilst [[Anárion]], Elendil's younger son, defended [[Osgiliath]] against the hosts of [[Mordor]].

The armies crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] at various locations and their forces were strengthened in the vale of [[Anduin]] by Elves from [[Lothlórien]] and [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] under the command of [[Oropher]] and [[Amdír]] and by the Dwarves of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

In {{SA|3434}} they defeated Sauron's army in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], breached the [[Morannon]] into [[Mordor]], and besieged the Dark Lord's fortress of [[Barad-dûr]]. The siege lasted for seven years, during which [[Anárion]] was slain. It culminated in Sauron leaving his fortress and engaging in direct combat. There were three objectives to this war; to unmake [[the One Ring]], to destroy [[Sauron]], and to destroy the foundation of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]].<ref name=SA/>

Sauron was felled by Gil-galad and Elendil, who both perished in the assault themselves. Elendil broke his sword [[Narsil]] as he fell. Using the hilt-shard of the sword, Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron's finger.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Bereft of the power of the One Ring, Sauron's spirit dissipated and would not take form again in Middle-earth for a thousand years.

With the victory over Sauron, and the death of Gil-galad and Elendil, the Last Alliance was dissolved. The remaining Númenóreans resettled their kingdoms.
