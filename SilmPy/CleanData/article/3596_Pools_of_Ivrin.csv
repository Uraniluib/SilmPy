'''Eithel Ivrin''', or Ivrin's Well was a fair pool in a stone basin carved by falling waters in the southern face of [[Dor-Lómin]] and beneath [[Ered Wethrin]]. The springs fed into the nearby '''Pools of Ivrin''' and the '''Falls of Ivrin''', and these features were sometimes collectively referred to as Ivrin.<ref name=bel>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

The pools themselves were surrounded by a tree-clad hollow<ref name="UTT">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref> and were the source of the River [[Narog]], which flowed from Ivrin some eighty leagues before it joined the River [[Sirion]].<ref name=bel/>

The springs marked the corner of the lands ruled by [[Turgon]] before he removed to [[Gondolin]], which extended westward from this point.<ref name=bel/>
==History==
Suggested by [[Gwindor]] to be a place blessed by [[Ulmo]] in ancient days and guarded them from defilement. Ivrin was also known as a place of healing, and for the endless laughter of its falling waters.<ref name="ST">{{S|Turin}}</ref>

After the rising of the Sun and the return of the [[Noldor]] to Middle-earth, King [[Fingolfin]] held the [[Mereth Aderthad]], the Feast of Reuniting, in the green and fair lands around the spring in {{FA|20}}.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> And [[Finduilas]], daughter of King [[Orodreth]], was called by Gwindor who loved her [[Faelivrin]], which is the gleam of the sun on the pools of Ivrin.<ref name="ST"/>

When [[Finrod Felagund]] and [[Beren]] set out from [[Nargothrond]], they journeyed north beside [[Narog]] to its source in the Falls of Ivrin before continuing on to [[Tol Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

After the death of his friend [[Beleg]], [[Túrin]] walked without purpose, but Gwindor brought him there and after drinking the waters of Ivrin, his tears were unloosed at last and he was healed of his madness and grief. It was beside the pools of Ivrin that he made the song ''[[Laer Cú Beleg]]'' before he and Gwindor followed the Narog south to [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{CH|9}}, p. 157</ref><ref name="ST"/>

Years later, when [[Morgoth]] released the dragon [[Glaurung]] into [[Beleriand]], Glaurung defiled Eithel Ivrin,<ref name="ST"/> uprooting the trees and breaking the stone basin so that the waters strayed and the land became a barren marsh and a welter of frozen mire.<ref name="SG">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|11}}, p. 176</ref>

After the overthrow of [[Nargothrond]], Turin was bewitched by Glaurung and he travelled north to Dor-lómin seeking his mother and sister. He came with the first ice of winter to the pools of Ivrin but it was frozen and he was unable to drink and be healed by the waters a second time.<ref name="ST"/><ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 182</ref>

It was at this time that [[Tuor]] and Túrin cross paths for the first and only time, for Tuor and [[Voronwë]] passed by the defiled pools of Ivrin on their way to [[Gondolin]]. But neither cousin spoke and Turin did not see Tuor, and Tuor did not recognize his kinsman.<ref name="SG"/><ref name="UTT"/>
