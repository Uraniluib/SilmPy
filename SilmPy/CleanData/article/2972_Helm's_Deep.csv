'''Helm's Deep''' was a large valley gorge in the north-western Ered Nimrais ([[White Mountains]]) below the [[Thrihyrne]]. It was actually the name of the whole defensive system including its major defensive structure, the [[Hornburg]].

==Geography and description==
The valley was blocked over its entire width by a trench and rampart called ''[[Helm's Dike]]'' and behind that lay the great fortress ''[[Hornburg]]''. A large rampart known as the [[Deeping Wall]] blocked the valley; it consisted of solid rock except for a small culvert which allowed the [[Deeping-stream]] (a small stream) to pass. The stream flowed out of the [[Glittering Caves]], a large cave system and the later site of Gimli's dwarf colony.

A long causeway wound up to the great gate of the fortress itself.  Inside the keep there were stables and an armoury, as well as a high tower in the centre.

==History==
Originally the valley was home to a small [[Gondor]]ian regiment, but after [[Calenardhon]] was ceded to the [[Éothéod]] it became an encampment of the [[Rohirrim]] of the [[Westfold]], and was used to guard the [[Gap of Rohan]].

During the war with the [[Dunlendings]] under [[Wulf]], the Rohirrim under King [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] and many of his people sought refuge in the keep, where they held out during the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758}}–{{TA|2759|n}}. Helm and his horn gave their names to the features of the Deep.

During the [[War of the Ring]] the fortress guarding Helm's Deep again became the refuge of some of the Rohirrim, now under King [[Théoden]], and the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] was fought there. After the battle, the [[Huorns]] laid the dead [[Uruk-hai]] of Saruman in a large mound known afterwards as the [[Death Down]]. The [[Dunlendings]] were buried more honourably in a separate mound below the Dike.
