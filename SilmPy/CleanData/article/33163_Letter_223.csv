==Summary==
Lost in a bottomless bog, Tolkien said he was utterly stuck.  Having spent so much time to complete ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' he was under extreme pressure, working 10 hours a day, to try to complete the ''[[The Ancrene Riwle|Ancrene Riwle]]''.  He had sent the text in September ''1958'' to the printer, but the manuscript had vanished during the Printing Strike.  When the proofs arrived ''this'' June he had been working on ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and had lost the threads of the other work.  Until the proofs of the text went back he could not lift his head.
