__NOTOC__
The '''Language of Dale''' was the tongue spoken by the [[Men of Dale|Men of]] [[Dale]] and as a [[Northern Mannish|Northern language]], it was related to [[Rohirric]] and more distantly, to [[Westron]]. 

The language, as well as the personal names of the Men of Dale closely resembled those of the Men in the [[Vale of Anduin]] and those of the [[Rohirrim]]; even those of some [[Hobbits]] who used high-sounding names and words from the Mannish language of the upper Anduin.<ref name=AppF2/><ref group=note>The relationship of the languages can be seen in the D. name [[Brand]] along with the H. name [[Ferdibrand Took|Ferdibrand]] and the R. name [[Erkenbrand]].</ref>

The language of Dale was adopted by the [[Dwarves]] from that region, such as the [[Dwarves of Erebor]]. In fact they used this tongue to introduce themselves to outsiders, forming their "outer" names, as it was a taboo to use their true, original [[Khuzdul]] names to other [[races]].<ref name=L144>{{L|144}}</ref><ref name=AppF2>{{App|F2}}</ref>

The writing system used by the Men of Dale was an old and simple form of the [[Cirth]].<ref>{{App|E2}}</ref>
==Translation==
In [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s stories, the language of Dale was rendered with [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]], a language related to [[Old English]] and modern English as the tongue of Dale was related to [[Rohirric]] and [[Westron]].<ref name=AppF2/><ref name=L144/>
