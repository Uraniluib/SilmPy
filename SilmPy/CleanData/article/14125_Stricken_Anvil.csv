The '''Stricken Anvil''' was the emblem of the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath]], a [[Twelve Houses of the Gondothlim|house]] of [[Gondolin]] under [[Rog]].  It was emblazoned upon their shields: a hammer striking an anvil, sending sparks up.  The larger part of that House were smiths, and it is probably from this that the symbol comes.<ref>{{LT2|Gondolin}}, p. 174</ref>
