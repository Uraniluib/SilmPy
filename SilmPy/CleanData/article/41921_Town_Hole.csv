'''Town Hole''' was a building in [[Michel Delving]] where the [[Mayor of Michel Delving|mayor]] resided.

Some time between {{TA|3013}} and {{TA|3018|n}} the building collapsed. Mayor [[Will Whitfoot]] emerged safe and sound from the ruins covered in white dust, and thus earned the affectionate nickname "Flourdumpling".<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> 
==Etymology==
The name must be a pun on [[Wikipedia:Town Hall|Town Hall]], and also suggests that it was a [[Hobbit-hole]].
