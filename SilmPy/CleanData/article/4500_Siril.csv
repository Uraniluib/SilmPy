'''Siril''' was the greatest of the few rivers on the island of [[Númenor]];<ref>{{UT|NMap}}</ref> it rose in the valley of [[Noirinan]] beneath the [[Meneltarma]], and flowed directly southwards to enter the sea at the fishing port of [[Nindamos]], on the borders of the [[Hyarnustar]] and the [[Hyarrostar]]. In its lower course it became a slow and winding stream, meeting the sea among wide marshes and reedy flats.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
