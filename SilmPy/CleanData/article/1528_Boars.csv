'''Boars''' were aggressive tusked beasts common to woodland regions. The most famous of all the boars of [[Middle-earth]] was the great [[Boar of Everholt]], that lived beneath the trees of the [[Firienholt|Firien Wood]]. This boar was hunted by King [[Folca]] of [[Rohan]], and though he eventually killed his quarry, the King was mortally wounded in the encounter.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line, Folca''</ref>
