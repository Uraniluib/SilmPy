The '''Lord of Moria''' ([[Sindarin]]: '''''Aran Moria''''') is the title of the ruler of [[Moria]] such as the [[Kings_of_Khazad-dûm|King of Khazad-dûm]] who was typically the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]. 

The title ''Aran Moria'', translated as '''Lord of Moria''', refers to [[Durin III]] and appears in the [[Doors of Durin]].<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

The kingdom had been abandoned in {{TA|1980}} but [[Balin]], a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the [[House of Durin]], led [[Balin's Colony|a small colony]] to reclaim it. His rule lasted only briefly ({{TA|2989}} - {{TA|2995|n}}) until his death. The [[Khuzdul]] phrase '''''Uzbad Khazaddûmu''''' meaning '''Lord of Moria''' was inscribed on [[Balin's Tomb|his tomb]].<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

==Etymology and analysis==

The phrase is translated as "Lord of Moria"; ''uzbad'' seems to be translated as "Lord", however since Khuzdul words of three consonants normally don't begin with a vowel, [[Magnus Åberg]] proposes that the word is enclitic, and *''u-'' is actually a prefix meaning "and".<ref name="magnus">''[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish]'' by Magnus Åberg</ref>

If this is so, ''uzbad'' is meaning "...and lord", the full phrase being "...son of [[Fundin]] ''and'' lord...". Åberg suggests that the basic form of "Lord" would be *''zâbad'' and "Lord of Moria" would be *''zâbad Khazaddûmu''.<ref name="magnus"/>

The ending ''[[-u]]'' in ''Khazaddûmu'' is probably "an ending that gives the noun an objective or locative meaning".<ref name="magnus"/>
