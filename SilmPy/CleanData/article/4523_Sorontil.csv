'''Sorontil''' is a mountain of [[Númenor]] (actually the only known besides [[Meneltarma]]) standing near the island's [[North Cape]] of [[Forostar]], with its eastern flanks forming sheer sea-cliffs.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref>

[[Tar-Meneldur]] built a tall tower in the vicinity of this mountain.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>
==Etymology==
Sorontil is not given a translation in the sources, but an apparent analysis would be ''[[soron]]'' + ''-[[til]]'', thus meaning "Eagle peak". The translation would suggest that its craggy peaks were possibly populated by [[Eagles]].<ref>{{webcite|website=EoA|articlename=Sorontil|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/sorontil.html|author=Mark Fisher}}</ref>
