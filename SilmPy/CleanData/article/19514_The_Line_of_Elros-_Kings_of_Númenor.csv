'''''The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor''''' is a chapter in the book ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and published posthumously by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. Less an actual tale, it resembles more a chronicle, consisting of a complete list of the [[King of Númenor|Kings of Númenor]] from the kingdom's foundation, in the year {{SA|32}} to its destruction, year {{SA|3319|n}}.

==Synopsis==

Before the list is detailed, the author and publisher write about the length in life of [[Elros|Elros Tar-Minyatur]]'s line, which was around 400 years and makes the distinction with the other lines of [[Númenóreans]], who's life span was considerably shorter, 200 years or less. But in the latest writing on this subject  the distinction in longevity is greatly diminished. To the Númenórean people as a whole is ascribed a life-span some five times the length of that of other Men
What follows is a list of the Númenórean kings, a total of 25. For each of them a short description is made, in which are mentioned the years of their birth, their death and the length of their rule, plus other notable events, if such existed.

The kings and queens depicted are:

1.  [[Elros|Elros Tar-Minyatur]]<br>
2.  [[Vardamir|Tar-Vardamir]]<br>
3.  [[Tar-Amandil]] <br>
