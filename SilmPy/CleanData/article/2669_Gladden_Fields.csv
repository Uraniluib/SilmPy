The '''Gladden Fields''' ([[Sindarin]] '''Loeg Ningloron''') was, at the end of the [[Third Age]], a large marsh on the west side of the [[Anduin]] that extended along either side of its tributary, the [[Gladden River]] (Sîr Ninglor), south of the [[Carrock]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>  

In ancient times a lake had formed at their meeting-place, but by the beginning of the [[Third Age]] the lake had been replaced by a wilderness of marshes and islets filled with reeds, rushes, and vast clumps of yellow irises grown taller than a man that grew there in hosts.<ref name="Note 13">{{UT|Gladden}}, note 13</ref>

==History==
In the [[First Age]] when the [[Silvan Elves]] first entered the [[Vales of Anduin]], they found a lake in the deep depression where the Anduin and Gladden met.  Although wider to the west, the lake probably did reach the sloping edge of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] .  After many years the lake filled with sediment and became a marsh.<ref name="Note 13"/>

In {{TA|2}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> near this place, on a slope east of the Anduin, [[Isildur]] and his three oldest sons were ambushed by [[Orcs]] when they marched back towards [[Arnor]].  Isildur's sons were killed in that battle, while he attempted to escape using the power of invisibility of [[the One Ring]].  He ran to the Anduin and tried to cross it.  Due to the current he was swept downstream until he reached the western bank near the inflow of the river Gladden.  But the Ring had slipped from Isildur's finger and when he stood up he was seen by Orcs, who laid there to kill any survivors of the ambush, and was slain by their arrows.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

During the reign of King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] of [[Gondor]] (who died in {{TA|1936|n}}) the [[Éothéod]] were a small people living in the Vale of Anduin; their southern boundary was the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>

During the height of [[Angmar]], after {{TA|1356|n}}, some [[Stoors]] from the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle of Eriador]] passed again the Mountains<ref name="TA"/> and probably about 1410<ref>{{HM|Guide}} p. 164</ref> a band resettled in the Gladden Fields and formed a matriarchic society.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref> It was here, about {{TA|2463|n}}, that the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] [[Déagol]] retrieved the One Ring from the Gladden and he was killed by his cousin Sméagol, who became the evil creature called [[Gollum]].<ref name="TA"/>

[[Borondir]], the messenger of Gondor sent by the Steward [[Cirion]] in {{TA|2510|n}}<ref name="TA"/> to seek aid from the Éothéod (who by then had migrated farther up the Anduin valley), was pursued as he rode north as far as the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (ii) ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>

In {{TA|2851}}, after a meeting of the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]] began searching near the Gladden Fields for the One Ring.<ref name="TA"/>  He became alarmed to discover that [[Sauron]]'s servants were also searching the region.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

==Etymology==
From [[Old English]] ''glaedene'', "gladden" is another name for the "flag" or "[[wikipedia:Iris (plant)|iris]]".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref> [[Tolkien]] identified the "gladden" as the yellow species ''[[wikipedia:iris pseudacorus|iris pseudacorus]]'' growing in streams and marshes, and not the species now usually spelt ''[[wikipedia:gladdon|gladdon]]''.<ref>{{L|297}}</ref>

Tolkien suggested to translators to avoid if possible the 'learned' name iris.<ref name="Nomen"/>
