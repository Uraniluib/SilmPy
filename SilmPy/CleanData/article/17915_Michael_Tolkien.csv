{{disambig-two|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s son|grandson of Tolkien|[[Michael George Tolkien]]}}
'''Michael Hilary Reuel "Mick" Tolkien''' ([[22 October]], [[1920]] - [[27 February]], [[1984]]) was the second son of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R.]] and [[Edith Tolkien]]. Tolkien wrote the story ''[[Roverandom]]'' as a way to console Michael over the loss of his toy dog; Michael appears in the story as '''boy Two'''.

Michael owned the puppet on which [[Tom Bombadil]] was based. Like his father, Michael also had '''[[Atlantis]]-haunting''' dreams while J.R.R. never mentioned his own to him.

His grandson is [[Royd Tolkien]], who cameo'ed as a [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.

==''Roverandom''==
In early September [[1925]], the Tolkien family (then [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Ronald]], [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]], [[John Tolkien|John]], [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] and a one-year-old [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]) went on holiday to the seaside resort of Filey in Yorkshire. Although Tolkien had holidayed there previously in [[1922]], Tolkien described Filey as "a very nasty little suburban seaside resort".<ref name="bio">{{HM|Bio}}</ref>{{rp|146}} During the holiday, Michael lost his beloved black-and-white toy dog on the beach; although the family searched for it, the toy dog could not be found. 

To console his son, Tolkien created the story of ''Roverandom'' to explain the adventures of the dog. Tolkien wrote the story down, based on his own oral version, in [[1927]] and also provided a number of illustrations which have since been published.<ref name="AI">{{HM|AI}}</ref>{{rp|77-83}} A few years later, Tolkien submitted ''Roverandom'' for publication to [[George Allen & Unwin]] in [[1936]] and although the book described by [[Rayner Unwin]] as "well written and amusing" it was never considered for publication, perhaps as a result of a desire for a [[The Lord of the Rings|sequel to ''The Hobbit'']].<ref name="Roverandom">{{HM|R}}</ref>{{rp|xvii}}

Throughout the story, Michael is referred to as "boy Two" as he's Tolkien's second son. In the story, boy Two is brought home a toy dog which he later loses at the beach. He never forgets the dog and later meets Roverandom in the dreamland on the moon. At the end of the story, boy Two is reunited with Roverandom, who is now a real dog.<ref name="Roverandom"/>{{rp|88}}
