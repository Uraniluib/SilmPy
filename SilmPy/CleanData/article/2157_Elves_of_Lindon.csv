The '''Elves of Lindon''' were those [[Elves]] who dwelt in [[Lindon]] in the west of [[Middle-earth]], between the [[Blue Mountains]] and the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]], in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s. 
==Population==
The original Elves of Lindon ([[Ossiriand]]) in the [[First Age]], were [[Laiquendi]], but were presumably joined by other Elves of the former [[Beleriand]] ([[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]]) who survived the [[War of Wrath]] and did not accept the invitation of the [[Valar]] to sail to [[Aman]].<ref name=princes>{{UT|6b}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> The Elves of [[Harlindon]] were mostly Sindar, ruled by [[Celeborn]].<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, Note 2</ref> 

Early in the Second Age, some of the Sindar were uneasy living among the Noldor under Gil-galad and left for the east or the south.<ref name=princes/>

In the [[Third Age]], the Elves of Lindon consisted most of the [[Eldar]] that still lingered in [[Middle-earth]]. Few remained in the [[Fourth Age]], if at all.<ref name=eriador/>
==History==
The Elves built the [[Grey Havens]] in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]] whence the [[Eldar]] could sail the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in, and preferred to linger there.<ref name=rings/> Although many Sindar left Lindon<ref name=princes/> the Elves reached the height of their power in the Second Age under King [[Gil-galad]]. 

A fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], emmissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance. Gil-galad and Master [[Elrond]] sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. Messengers were sent from Lindon with warnings; but they were unheeded, and Annatar was received gladly, mostly in [[Eregion]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> However Gil-galad and Elrond were proven correct, as Annatar was indeed [[Sauron]] and later [[War of the Elves and Sauron|a massive war begun]]. Elrond came out of Lindon with Elves in [[Sack of Eregion|battle to defend Eregion]]. With them, and other Elves who fled the destruction of [[Eregion]], he established [[Imladris]] in {{SA|1697}}.<ref name=SA/> After those events, the Elf-realm of Lindon was diminished and didn't extend east of the Blue Mountains any more.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note #75</ref>

In the [[Dark Years]] [[Sauron]] had conquered most of the [[Westlands]], but in {{SA|1700}} [[Tar-Minastir]] sent a fleet to Lindon, aiding the Elves to drive Sauron out of Eriador.<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/> Sauron's army was driven back to [[Sarn Ford]] where they were defeated and withdrew to [[Tharbad]].<ref name="Concerning">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

At the end of the Age, Gil-galad joined the [[Last Alliance]] and led his armies to the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. Some of the [[Silvan Elves]] felt hostility towards the Noldor, and those under [[Oropher]] and [[Amdir]] attacked independedly, suffering heavy losses.<ref name=princes/> 
===After Gil-galad===

After the War and the death of Gil-galad, [[Cirdan]] remained the only Lord of the Havens. During the [[Third Age]], the Elves of Lindon under [[Cirdan]] supported [[Arnor]] in the [[Angmar War]]. They assisted [[Arveleg]] and the men of [[Cardolan]] drive off the [[Hill-men]] from the [[Weather Hills]]. Later, with Círdan’s help, Arveleg's young son, [[Araphor]], drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.<ref name=eriador/>

In {{TA|1975}}, Elven sailors from Lindon brought a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue the lost king [[Arvedui]].  The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished.  The next year the elves joined with the [[Dúnedain]] in the victorious [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

For the course of the Third Age, the Elves of Lindon built ships for the Elves who wished to return to the Blessed Realm and they didn't seem to participate in greater events. During the [[War of the Ring]] [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was sent to [[Rivendell]] for an errand, and incidentally he represented Cirdan in the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>
