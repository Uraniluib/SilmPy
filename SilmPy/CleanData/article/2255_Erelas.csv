'''Erelas''' was one of the seven [[warning beacons of Gondor]], the fourth that would be lit when [[Minas Tirith]] called for aid from [[Rohan]]. It was a bald green hill, with no trees or plants. Its attendants would set fire to their beacon when they saw a flame on [[Nardol]], far to the east, and their own beacon-fire would be answered by that on the peak of [[Min-Rimmon]] to the west. All these beacon hills lay among the [[White Mountains]] as they came down into the plains of [[An√≥rien]], the fief of [[Gondor]] that lay on Rohan's borders.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding east on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from [[Rohan]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Despite being [[Sindarin]] in style, ''Erelas'' was not a Sindarin name. The true meaning of the name is lost in history.<ref name=VT42>{{VT|42a}}, p. 19</ref>
