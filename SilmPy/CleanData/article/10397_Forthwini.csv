'''Forthwini''' was the second [[Lord of the Éothéod]] while they lived in the [[Vales of Anduin]]. He was the son of [[Marhwini]].<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> 

==History==
During Forthwini's rule his spies learned that the [[Wainriders]], a tribe of [[Easterlings]] who had invaded decades earlier, had recovered and were allying themselves with other forces in the [[East]]. He alerted King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] of the growing threat, and later the [[Éothéod]] joined the armies of Gondor in battle against the invaders.<ref name="Cirion"/> Though Ondoher was slain, his successor [[Eärnil II]] eventually destroyed the Wainriders. There is no record of Forthwini's fate.

==Etymology==
The name means "forth-friend" in [[Gothic]]. The second element ''-wini'' is an archaic form of ''-wine'' seen in [[Rohirric]] names (as in [[Folcwine]]).<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 6</ref>
