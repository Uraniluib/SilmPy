'''Malvegil''' ({{TA|1144}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1349|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 205) was the sixth ruler of [[Arthedain]].

==History==
Malvegil was the son of [[Celebrindor]], and gained the kingship of [[Arthedain]] upon his father's death in {{TA|1272}}.<ref name="North"/>

It was during Malvegil's reign (c. {{TA|1300|n}}) that the [[Witch-king]] saw an opportunity in the disunion of the [[Arnorians]] and he went to the North and founded [[Angmar]].  To this realm were drawn evil men, [[Orcs]] (who begin attacking the [[Dwarves]]), and other fell creatures.  Due to the growing evils of the [[Misty Mountains]], [[Hobbits]] moved westward and many of them settle in [[Bree]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Malvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-seven years, and was succeeded by his son [[Argeleb I]] in {{TA|1349|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
Malvegil's name probably means "Sword of Gold" or "Golden Sword", being a combination of the [[Sindarin]] words ''mall-'' meaning "gold", and ''megil'' (becoming lenited to ''vegil'') meaning "sword".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>
