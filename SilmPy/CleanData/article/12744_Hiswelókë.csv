'''Hiswelókë''' ([[Quenya]] for "Dragon of Mist"), is a French-language website founded in 1997 by [[Didier Willis]] seeking to popularise scholarship of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] through French-language articles and essays. 

In the earlier days of the website, some articles and essays were originally collected into various editions of an e-zine,<ref name="Downloads">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3 Hiswelókë], "[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/download.php?lng=fr Téléchargements]" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> but as this is no longer the case each article is now freely available independently. Aside from fan fiction, the website includes articles on botany, linguistics, geography, mythology, [[wikipedia:onomastics|onomastics]] (the study of names) and reviews of other pieces of scholarly work.

Specifically, from [[23 October|October 23]], [[1999]]<ref name="News">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary], "[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/news.html News]" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> the project has included '''Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary''' which aims to create a complete [[Sindarin]] dictionary - including annotations and relevant amendments - aimed at satisfying the requirements of both serious scholars and casual fans.<ref name="About">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary], "[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/about.html About]" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> Aside from online wordlists, the project also includes downloadable [[wikipedia:XML|XML]] lexicons, and the [[Dragon Flame]] and Hesperides freeware applications.
