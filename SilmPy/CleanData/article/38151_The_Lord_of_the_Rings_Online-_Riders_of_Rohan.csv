==Mounted Combat==
''Riders of Rohan'' allows players to fight from horseback for the first time. Early quests in [[The Wold]] of East Rohan give players access to a War-steed, a special breed of horse trained for combat. Players can learn special attacks and maneuvers for their War-steeds and their mounts level up with experience just as the players do. War-steeds can be ridden in most game regions but mounted combat options are only available in Rohan.
