'''Scatha the Worm''' was a mighty [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] of the [[Grey Mountains]] and one of the greatest [[Dragons]] to infest that range of the north.

==History==
Little is known of Scatha's life, except that he possessed a great hoard, stolen from the [[Dwarves]]. He was slain by [[Fram]] son of [[Frumgar]] in the early days of the [[Éothéod]]. 

His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the Men of the Éothéod and the [[Dwarves]] of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." It was rumored that for this insult the Dwarves killed him.  <ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

It seems like Fram's people retained at least some of the hoard, and [[Eorl]] brought it south when they settled in [[Rohan]]. The [[Horn of the Mark]] that [[Éowyn]] gave to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] after the [[War of the Ring]] many hundred of years later was said to come from Scatha's hoard.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Scatha'' was a name in the language of the Éothéod, translated into [[Old English]]. The name means "injurer, enemy, robber".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (eds.), ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', published in [[Wayne G.
