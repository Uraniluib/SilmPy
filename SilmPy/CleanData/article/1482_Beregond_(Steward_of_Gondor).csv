}}'''Beregond''' ([[Third Age]] 2700<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> – 2811,<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 111 years) was the twentieth Ruling Steward of [[Gondor]].  

==History==
Beregond was the greatest captain since the time of [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]]. Before the spring of {{TA|2759}} Beregond defeated the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], who had invaded the southern coasts of Gondor. Then he was able to send help to the [[Rohirrim]], who had been attacked by a combined force of [[Dunlendings]] and [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] that had sailed up the [[Isen]].

He succeeded his father [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] at his death in {{TA|2763|n}}. By this time Gondor started recovering its strength.

During Beregond's rule, the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] was fought ({{TA|2793}} - {{TA|2799|n}}).  Only rumours of the fighting came south until Orcs fleeing from the [[Battle of Nanduhirion]] crossed [[Rohan]] and established themselves in the [[White Mountains]].  Fighting occurred in many dales before they were eradicated.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Beregond was followed by his son [[Belecthor II]] at his death in 2811.<ref name="South"/>
