{{Pronounce|Druedain.mp3|Ardamir}}
The '''Drúedain''' (sg. '''Drúadan''') or '''Drúath''' (sg. '''Drûg''') is a race of wild [[Men]]. The [[Rohirrim]] called them '''Woses''' or '''Wild Men of the Woods'''. 

They were clearly a good-hearted people who suffered by the persecution by either by malice of [[Men of Darkness|evil people]]; or by ignorance as their ("unlovely" according to the [[Elves]]) appearance led many to believe they were savage beasts. Although some of their numbers joined the [[Edain]] and some briefly remained on [[Númenor]], they largely held themselves apart from the troubles and calamities of [[Middle-earth]], and possessed their own mysterious ways and magic.
==History==
===First Age===
The Drúedain were part of the [[Edain]] who left [[Hildórien]] for the [[Westlands|West]]. They were harried and persecuted by other [[Men]] which made them  secretive and suspicious. They wandered west seeking a land where they could be hidden and have peace.<ref name="TD">{{UT|12}}</ref>

Historians in [[Gondor]] believed that they came from lands south of [[Mordor]], and before reaching the coasts of [[Harad|Haradwaith]] they turned north into [[Ithilien]]. They were the first to cross the [[Anduin]] (probably near [[Cair Andros]]) and settled in the northern vales and wooden lands of the [[White Mountains]] in both sides; this people carved crude figures of stone, and would later be known as [[Púkel-men]].<ref name="TD"/> The Drúedain who remained in the Mountains were hunted by tall [[Men of Darkness|Men from the East]], and were all but annihilated. The survivors fled into the forests of [[Anórien]] and down the [[Andrast|Cape of Andrast]] into [[Drúwaith Iaur]].<ref name="TD"/> Groups of remaining Drúedain became numerous but were troubled by a barbarous fisher-folk which dwelt in the marshlands between the mouths of the [[Gwathló]] and [[Isen]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref name="I">{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Others among the Drúedain who continued west were joined by the ancestors of the [[Haladin]] and stayed on friendly terms. When the core of their team was pressed to wander on, some Drúedain accompanied them to [[Beleriand]]. Those lived among the Haladin, in the forest of [[Brethil]].<ref name="TD"/> When [[Túrin]] was found by the [[Haladin]], he identified himself as a "Wildman of the Woods".<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> When the Haladin fell into ruin and [[Morgoth]] had destroyed all the realms and strongholds of [[Elves]] and Men, the Drúedain of Brethil dwindled to a few families, mostly women and children, of which some found refuge at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref name="TD"/>

===Second Age===
When the Dúnedain of Beleriand set forth for the island of [[Elenna]], where they would establish the kingdom of [[Númenor]], the Drúedain refugees who had dwelt at the Mouths of Sirion were permitted to join them, where they greatly prospered. However, they started leaving the island during the time of [[Tar-Aldarion]], foreseeing the evil that would come. By the [[Downfall of Númenor]], all Drúedain had left the island.<ref name="TD"/>

Those between Isen and [[Gwathló]] were reduced to a few tribes of fishers and fowlers.<ref name="I"/> They began to fear the [[Númenóreans]] and when their occupation of the coastlands began, they retreated in the mountains of [[Andrast]], which was never occupied by the Númenóreans.<ref name="TD"/> Some [[Pre-Númenóreans]] also wished to flee the Sea Kings, however they were afraid of the Púkel-men and did not cross the [[Isen]] nor take refuge in the Cape.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>

===Third Age===
At the end of the Third Age they still lived in the [[Drúadan Forest]] of the [[White Mountains]], and at the long cape of [[Andrast]] west of [[Gondor]]. The region north of Andrast was still known as [[Drúwaith Iaur]], or "Old Drûg land". Known also as '''Woses''', they feared [[Sauron]], and the [[Rohirrim]], who hunted them for sport.

During the [[War of the Ring]] the chieftain of the enclave of the White Mountains was [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]]. Their most significant contribution to the [[Free peoples]] was showing the [[Rohirrim]] paths through the Drúadan Forest, thus helping them reach the [[Pelennor Fields]] soon, evading the [[Orcs|Orc]] army that was waiting for them along the [[North-South Road]]. The Woses also used their tactics to hold off an army of Orcs searching for the Rohirrim. 
===Fourth Age===
After the [[War of the Ring]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Drúadan Forest to be theirs forever, forbidding anyone to enter without their permission. They never showed their faces again, nor was any alliance or trading system struck up between them and Gondor in the [[Fourth Age]]. It is clear that they never mingled with the Free Peoples, content to live their reclusive mysterious life until they faded away into the mists of [[#Inspiration|history and legend]].
==Characteristics==
In appearance, the Woses were short, stumpy-bodied men, possibly related to the [[Púkel-men]] of ancient [[Rohan]], with disproportionate bodies. In build, stature and endurance they resembled the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=atani/>

Their faces had "unlovely" (for the general human standards) features, and their hair was sparse and lank.<ref name=atani/> They had small, sunken eyes that glowed red when they were angry or suspicious. They grew no hair below the eyebrows, with the exception of some men who grew black tufts on their chins.

==Culture==
They were primitive but were woodcrafty and skilled stone workers, but also had mysterious powers of clairvoyance and healing, and [[magic]] related to the control of stone.<ref name=atani/> 

In temperament and character they were merry like [[Hobbits]]; but in their grim side (although not as the [[Dwarves]]) they could be sardonic and ruthless. They were frugal and ate sparingly and drank only water, even during peaceful or plentiful times.<ref name=atani/>

A hardy people, in the early First Age they used caves in the mountains as store-houses, which they used also as sleeping-places during severe weather. They maintained this custom in Beleriand (except the most hardy. These places were guarded and didn't allow even their [[Haladin]] friends to enter. Otherwise they were content to live in tents or makeshift shelters biult round large trees.<ref name=atani/>

For weapons, the Woses of Drúadan used poison-darts and arrows.

== Names ==
*'''[[Drughu]]:''' the Drúedain's own name for themselves. Drughu is ultimately the source of the Sindarin 'Drú' and many of the other names they are known by.
*'''[[Drú]]/Drúin:''' Simple [[Sindarin]] term for the Drughu, singular and plural.
*'''Drúath:''' An earlier Sindarin collective (that means, plural) term for the Drúedain, modified as early as the [[First Age]] when it became known that they were enemies of the orcs. Later used to refer to a large number of the Drúedain as opposed to 'Drúin' which was a simple pluralisation (As 'Woses' to the singular 'Wose') and Drúedain, used to refer to the race as a whole. 
*'''Drúadan/Drúedain:''' Meaning 'Drú-men'. It also has possessive qualities as in the case of [[Drúadan Forest]]
*'''[[Drúedain|Drûg]]-folk:''' Rarely used collective term.
*'''[[Róg]]/[[Rógin]]:''' [[Rohirric]] terminology, singular/plural respectively (as in 'Drúg'/'Drúedain'. In Tolkien's text it is translated as Wose(s).
*'''Wose/Woses:''' A term borrowed from Old English by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] as a translation of the Rohhirric 'Róg'. This is perhaps the most common term used by readers of the text.
*'''[[Rú]]/[[Rúatani]]<ref name="Druedain"/>:''' Quenya terms for the Drughu, derived from their Sindarin counterparts. Singular/plural respectively.

==Etymology==
The name means "Drû-man". 

The element ''[[Drû]]'' is an adaptation of ''[[Drughu]]'', which is how that race calls themselves in their language. As the [[Elves]] came to know the Drû better, and to recognise their bitter enmity to the [[Orcs]], they acquired the element ''[[Edain]]''.<ref name="Druedain">{{UT|Druedain}}, note 6</ref>

The word ''Wose'' represents [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s translation of the actual word ''[[róg]]'' of the [[Rohirrim]] into archaic English. 

"Woses" is Anglicized (modernized) from the [[Old English]] word ''wāsan'' meaning "wild, neglected". It is seen in the name ''Wuduwasas'' (who are the direct inspiration of the Woses) and means "Wild men of the woods".
==Inspirations==
In Western folklore, the "wuduwasa" or "wood man" is a hairy, troll-like being supposed to inhabit woods and forests; the figure was used on coats-of-arms and illuminations during the middle-ages up to the renaissance.

Both the description of Woses, as well as the word "Wose" itself, derives from this folkloric figure. According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] his idea was to show the actual existence of wild folk, remnants of former peoples driven out by invaders, living a debased and savage life in forests and mountains.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 764-5</ref>
