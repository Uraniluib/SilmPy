'''Taur-en-Faroth''' was the range of wooded hills in [[West Beleriand]] that rose up above the western side of the River [[Narog]].<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> They were part of the Realm of [[Nargothrond]].

The hills themselves were the western end of the [[Andram]]. It was among these hills that the stream of [[Ringwil]] rose and cascaded down into the main river.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> In their steep eastern sides above the Narog, there was a network of caverns.<ref name="Return">{{S|Return}}</ref>

In ancient times, these Caverns of Narog known as ''[[Nulukkizdîn]]'', had been home to [[Petty-dwarves]] who dwelt there in secret<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> before the arrival of [[Finrod]]. What became of the Petty-Dwarves at this time is not recorded, but at least some escaped to dwell in [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name is translated in full as ''Forest of the Hunters''<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Taur-en-Faroth"</ref> from [[Sindarin]] ''[[taur]]'' "(great) forest", ''[[en]]'' "of" and ''[[faroth]]'', a word related to hunting.

These uplands were also called ''High Faroth''<ref name="Return"/><ref>{{S|14}}</ref> or ''Hills of the Hunters'' in the [[Lay of Leithian]]<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>.
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the ''[[Etymologies]]'' an early [[Noldorin]] name ''Taur-na-Faras'' is given, translated as "Hill of the Hunters, Hunters' Wold".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry SPAN</ref>
