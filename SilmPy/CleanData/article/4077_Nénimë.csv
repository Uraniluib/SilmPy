'''Nénimë''' ([[Nínui]] in [[Sindarin]]) was the second month of the year in the [[Kings' Reckoning]] and the [[Stewards' Reckoning]].  In both calendars, ''Nénimë'' followed the month [[Narvinyë]], preceded the month of [[Súlimë]], and was 30 days long, lasting from the 32nd through the 61st days of the year. In the [[New Reckoning]] it was the eleventh month of the year.

''Nénimë'' in the Kings' and Stewards' Reckoning corresponded to [[Solmath]] in the [[Shire Calendar]] (approximately modern [[22 January]] through [[20 February]]).<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
