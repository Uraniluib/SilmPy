The '''Old Ford''' was the point where the [[Old Forest Road]] crossed the River [[Anduin]], about forty miles downriver from the [[Carrock]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> In older times, the river was crossed by a stone bridge here, but by the end of the [[Third Age]], the bridge had long since disappeared, and the crossing was no more than a simple ford.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, Note 14</ref>
