'''Helm's Gate''' was a passage between two forbidding cliff-faces, the northern side guarded by the castle of the [[Hornburg]], that led to the fastness of [[Helm's Deep]] in the [[White Mountains]]. The Gate was walled from north to south, and was the site of the ferocious siege known as the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>
