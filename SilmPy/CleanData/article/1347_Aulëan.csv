'''Aulëan''' is the language phylum of [[Khuzdul]], the language of the [[Dwarves]]. It is there contrasted with [[Oromëan]], the language phylum of the [[Elvish]] languages such as [[Qenya]], [[Kornoldorin]] and [[Ilkorin]]. Aulëan was named from the [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]] tradition that it had been devised by [[Aulë]] the Smith, the [[Valar|Vala]] who created the [[Dwarves]].

This concept was later dropped, although the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' mentions that Aule started teaching the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] before [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] scolded him.
