<!--Add the following sections: Crafting, Economy & Currency, Social (Kinships), Hobbies (Fishing), Housing, Special packs, Festivals, Game Music, Music system, Instances & Raids, Skills & Traits, Quests & Tasks, Reputation and Deeds-->'''''The Lord of the Rings Online''''' (commonly abbreviated to '''LOTRO''' or '''LotRO''') is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) for PC and OS X that takes place in the world of [[Arda]] during the time of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]].'' It was originally branded as '''The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar''', but with later updates, that subtitle was dropped. 

The players take on the role of adventurers of the [[Free peoples|Free Peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]]. The events of the game are concurrent with the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' but most of the game revolves around events that occurred elsewhere or in the wake of events in the books. The game draws inspiration from people, places and events only mentioned in the books, combining these with original concepts to expand on parts of Middle-earth Tolkien did not. The main quest series of the game, known as Epic Quests, are divided into volumes, books and chapters, emulating the structure of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

To date, there have been six purchasable expansions: Mines of Moria (2008), Siege of Mirkwood (2009), Rise of Isengard (2011), Riders of Rohan (2012), Helm's Deep (2013) and Mordor (2017),  with many smaller updates in between.

<!--This is a copy of wikipedia's article. Rewrite and expansion is needed, especially on post-2007 updates-->
Development began in 1998, when [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] started work on a game called ''[[Middle-earth Online]]''. Following [[Vivendi|Vivendi Universal Games]]' takeover of Sierra, the game's production was shared with [[Turbine]]. Turbine secured the rights of the entire game in March 2004,<ref>[http://www.videogamer.com/news/turbine_spin_into_action_to_secure_tolkien_license.html Turbine spin into action to secure Tolkien license - VideoGamer.com]</ref> and it was renamed to ''The Lord of the Rings Online''. It was originally subscription-based, but later became free-to-play with optional paid subscription and microtransactions.

A closed beta was announced on [[8 September|September 8]], [[2006]]. An open beta began on [[30 March|March 30]], [[2007]], and was open to all who pre-ordered the game's Founders Club edition. In April [[2007]], the beta opened to the public.

==Gameplay==
===Characters===
''Main article: [[Character Classes (LOTRO)]]''
Like many RPGs, ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' has a system of character classes and levels. Each character chooses a race and a class on character creation, this cannot be changed. Players are able to play as any of the [[Free Peoples]] - [[Elves]], [[Men]], [[Dwarves]], [[Hobbits]], [[Beornings]], or [[High Elves]]. Male or female characters can be created, except in the case of Dwarves. As per Tolkien, Dwarf women are very rare and seldom leave their mountain halls. There are ten classes: Beorning, Burglar, Captain, Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Lore-master, Minstrel, Rune-keeper, and Warden.

Customization of the character's abilities can be done by changing equipment and traits. As of the [[The Lord of the Rings Online#Helm.27s Deep Expansion|Helm's Deep expansion]], class traits work on a tree system, with each class having three "trait trees" where traits can be selected with earned points and unlocking enough traits in a particular tree allows higher-level traits to be selected and applies additional bonus. In addition to class traits are racial traits, such as Men being able to slot a trait to do additional damage with swords or Hobbits being able to slot a trait that allows them to throw a stone, and virtue traits which boost the character's stats.

Levels are significant, with much lower level enemies being extremely easy to defeat and much higher level enemies being nearly impossible to defeat. Each region has enemies and quests with a range of levels usually consecutive to those of an adjacent region. Quests over five levels above the character's level are inaccessible. In addition to being able to complete quest and defeat enemies in more locations, characters gain access to additional equipment, skills, traits and instances as they level up. Levels are increased by gaining experience, which is earned by completing quests and instances, defeating enemies of an appropriate level, and crafting.

===World===
''The Lord of the Rings Online'' is an "open-world" game in which most locations that have been released can be freely accessed on an open landscape (although some places, such as Moria, require certain quests to be completed first.) The game world is split into "lands", large areas of Middle-Earth. As of Update 21, the four lands in the game are [[Eriador]], [[Rhovanion]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]]. Each land is in turn divided into regions, e.g. [[Bree-land]] in Eriador, and each region contains areas, e.g. [[Andrath]] within Bree-land.

Although most of the land is available to all for exploration, most regions require non-VIPs to purchase a quest pack to access quests, deeds and instances associated with that region. A few regions, such as East and West Rohan, require expansion packs to be purchased to unlock content, even for VIPs. Each region is generally seen as it was in a certain time in the War of the Ring, for example Lothl√≥rien is visited by the player at the same time as the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] rested there, and [[Pelargir]] just after [[Aragorn]] liberated the city from the [[Corsairs of Umbar]].

===Quests===
Much of the game's completable content is in the form of quests. Quests consist of a series of objectives, often including speaking with NPCs, defeating certain enemies, and recovering certain items from the ground or from defeated enemies. Most quests have a small number of objectives but may unlock additional quests upon completion to form a quest chain. Quests are usually started by started by speaking with a particular Non-Player Character (NPC), indicated with a ring icon above the NPC's head. The forms of ring icons and what they indicate are as follows:

*Gold ring with blue aura: the NPC has a quest that is approximately appropriate for the character's level.
*Gold ring with blue aura and fiery inscription: the NPC must be spoken with to advance the quest.
*Bright gold ring: the NPC has an Epic quest available.
*Gold ring with orange flames: the NPC must be spoken to to advance the Epic quest.
*Blue ring and quill: the NPC has a comment about an active quest, speaking to the NPC will not advance the quest but may give additional information.
*Gold ring with hourglass: the NPC has a quest with a cooldown, the player must wait for the cooldown to expire before accepting the quest.
*Silver ring: the NPC has a quest that is too high level for the player to accept at that level.
*Transparent grey ring: the NPC has a "trivial" quest, one far below the player's level.
*Gold ring with anvil: the NPC has a crafting quest, and involves the crafting system in some way.
*Gold ring with sword: The NPC has an allegiance quest; quests that are unique to the Mordor Expansion.

Some quests are started by obtaining unique items dropped from specific enemies. The [[The Lord of the Rings Online#Riders of Rohan Expansion|Riders of Rohan expansion]] introduced auto-bestowed quests, which bring up a quest prompt when the player defeats a specific type of enemy or finds a certain location. Such enemies are marked with ring icons similarly to how NPC quest givers are. Players have the option of accepting these quests automatically or choosing to manually accept or decline each prompt. Most landscape quests can only be completed once, some special landscape quests and most instance quests can be completed once a day any number of times, and a few landscape quests can be repeated at any time up to a certain number of times.

Quests are categorized according to what area, instance or other section they are associated with. Of note are the Epic Quests, a series that tells the main storyline of the game. In imitation of [[The Lord of the Rings|the Lord of the Rings book]], the epic quests are divided into Volumes, which are divided into Books which in turn are divided into Chapters. Each Chapter is usually an individual quest. Epic Quests bring the player through the landscape but are considered apart from it, therefore most Epic Quests are available to all players regardless of whether or not any quest packs are unlocked. A notable exception is the end of [[Allies of the King|Volume III: Allies of the King]], which requires purchase of the Helm's Deep expansion to complete. The Black Book of Mordor, the new main storyline for quests after the Epic Books, has eight chapters, all spanning various areas in Middle Earth including [[Mordor]], the Strongholds of the North, the [[Iron Hills]], and the [[Ered Mithrin]].

===Deeds===
Deeds are non-repeatable achievements recorded on an interface window called the Deed Log. Common deed objectives include completing a certain number of quests in a particular area or region (Quest Deeds), defeating a certain number of enemies of a specific type in a particular region (Slayer Deeds), discovering specified locations (Explorer Deeds), and reaching the next tier of reputation with a faction. Most Deeds award Turbine points. Deeds in a particular region usually award reputation in that region's faction. Deeds also commonly reward marks, virtues, and titles

===Instances===
Instances are locations in the game separated from the open landscape, not accessible through normal travel. Instances can take place in either separate versions of the locations available on the landscape (for example, Pelargir while Aragorn's host retakes it from the corsairs) or in locations not accessible anywhere else (such as Dale). Most instances are private instances, that is, only one player or group of players can enter it and it closes when they complete it, while public instances can be joined at any time by any number of separate players. They are often repeatable, with ones associated with landscape quests being replayable through a Reflecting Pool in the associated region and others accessible through the Instance Finder window. Most private instances have associated quests automatically bestowed upon entering the instance and cancelled upon exiting.

===Fellowships and Kinships===
Most open landscape content and associated instances are designed to be completable by a solo player, while some locations in the game and Instance Finder instances are meant for a team of players. A group of players with a maximum size of six is known as a fellowship. For larger groups, a raid of up to four fellowships can be formed, for a maximum group size of 24 players. Players are free to group on the open landscape and in public instances, but private instances have a limit on how many players may enter.

Players can found and join lasting organizations known as Kinships in the game. Players in a kinship can communicate in their own kinship chat channel to socialize and plan events with their fellow members.

===Monster Play===
The game is primarily Player vs. Environment (PvE), with most combat being player characters against computer controlled enemies found throughout the landscape and instances. However in the [[Ettenmoors]] region, players can participate in Player vs. Monster Player battles (PvMP). Players can create Monster characters that only have access to PvMP areas where they battle standard characters, who fight on the side of the Free Peoples. Each monster player class is limited to a specific race. The monster classes are the Blackarrow (Uruk), Defiler (Orc), Reaver (Orc), Stalker (Warg), Warleader (Uruk), and Weaver (Spider) As of [[The Lord of the Rings Online#Update 16: Ashes of Osgiliath|Update 16.2]] a new PvMP area, set in Osgiliath before Boromir's journey to Rivendell and accessed via a banner in the Ettenmoors, was released.

<!--Need elaboration on the below and info on Legendary Items, Mounted Combat and other special systems.-->

Towns and settlements provide Vendors where players can purchase or repair their armour, weapons, and supplies. Towns also often include Mailboxes, Auction Halls, Class Trainers, Forge-masters, Relic-masters, and Stable-masters who allow swift travel between regions.

The player interface allows other aspects of gameplay such as Character screens, Quest and Deed Logs, a Social Panel where players can interact, and a Crafting panel where players use skills to craft new items.
