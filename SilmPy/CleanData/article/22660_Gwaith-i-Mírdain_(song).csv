==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Thousand years of peace 
They lived together 
No grudge nor greed 
Without was heavenly better 
Dwarvens artisans 
The greatest elven smiths 
Crowded the mountain halls 
And city of Ost-in-Edhil 

People of the jewel smiths 
Gwaith-i-Mírdain 
People of the jewel smiths 
Gwaith-i-Mírdain 

Thousand years of peace 
They lived together 
No grudge nor greed 
Without was heavenly better 
Two lores as one 
Aroused the days of wonder 
Casted the spells and charms 
Unleashed the power of god 

Once again they'll reveal 
Their souls 
Once again they'll see 
Beyond the higher arts 
By their hands were made 
All the things 
Crown of the Jewels 
Enchantment of the Rings
