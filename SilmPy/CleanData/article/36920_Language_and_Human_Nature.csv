'''''Language and Human Nature''''' was a joint literature project between [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk The Telegraph]'', "[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/christopherhowse/100001547/jrr-tolkien-and-cs-lewis-joint-work-discovered/ JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis joint work discovered]", dated 19 July 2009 (accessed 29 November 2011)</ref> Their publisher had announced that the book was to be published in [[1950]] but it was never completed.

In [[2009]], Regents’ Professor and Chair of the Texas State University Department of Communication Studies, Steven Beebe, discovered the beginning pages of the manuscript in the Oxford University [[Bodleian Library]]. 

According to Beebe "the manuscript includes some of Lewis’s best and most precise statements about the nature of language and meaning. Both Lewis and Tolkien wrote separately about language, communication, and meaning, but they published nothing collaboratively."<ref>[http://www.txstate.edu/news/ Texas State University News], "[http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/07/CSLewis070809.html Beebe discovers unpublished C.S. Lewis manuscript]", dated 8 July 2009 (accessed 29 November 2011)</ref>
