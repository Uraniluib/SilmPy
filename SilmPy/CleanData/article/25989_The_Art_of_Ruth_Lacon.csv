A beautiful book covering Ruthâ€™s variety of media and styles. The illustrations range from black & white pen & ink to full colour, very bright, with much attention to details and borders, and covers the whole Tolkien spectrum from Lord of the Rings through Hobbit to Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales & Farmer Giles.
