The '''Oldbuck Family''' was an ancient family of Shire-hobbits, who went on to become one of the most well-known families of Shire. 

== History ==
Consisting of mainly [[Stoors|Stoorish]] blood, the members of this prosperous family came from the [[Marish]], where they traced their heritage to one [[Bucca of the Marish]], the first [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]]. Thainship was in the Oldbuck family until {{TA|2340}} (S.R. 740).

In that year, they settled across the [[Brandywine]] by [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], who later changed their surname to [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]], after the river Brandywine.
==Etymology==
"Oldbuck" is the English translation of the genuine [[Hobbitish]] name ''[[Zaragamba Family|Zaragamba]]'', of the same meaning.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>
