The '''Pass of Sirion''', in the [[First Age]], was a steep-sided pass between the [[Ered Wethrin]] and the [[Echoriad]], on the upper reaches of the River [[Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  The sheer walls were covered with pines yet the vale was green.  In the middle of the pass was the isle of [[Tol Sirion]] where [[Finrod]] built the tower of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]].  After Finrod departed to [[Nargothrond]] the fortress was committed to Finrod's kinsman [[Orodreth]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

During the [[Dagor Bragollach]] King [[Finrod]] was surrounded with a small company in the [[Fen of Serech]].  There he would have fallen but for the arrival of [[Barahir]] who came through the Pass of Sirion and rescued him.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>  However, by the end of this great battle [[Morgoth]] held the Pass.

During the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] it was through the Pass of Sirion that [[Turgon]] led the main host of [[Gondolin]] north into battle, and then again south when in retreat.  During that retreat [[Huor]] formed a rearguard south of the Fen of Serech and resisted until all of his men but one were slain.  That one was [[HÃºrin]] who was captured and then taken to [[Angband]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

[[Glaurung]] the [[Dragons|dragon]] came through the Pass of Sirion and defiled the waters of the [[Eithel Ivrin]] on his way to [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>
