'''Tarnost''' was a location in [[Gondor]], on the northern foothills, between the river [[Gilrain]] to the east and [[Dol Amroth]] to the west. To the north was the river [[Ringló]]. The location is not mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
Tarnost does not appear in the close-up map of Gondor in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> The first reference is in ''[[The War of the Ring]]'': In the Western map section there is a dot visible in square Q12 at the northern tip of the hills south of the Ringló, and the text states that it had a penciled note calling it ''Tarnost''.<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, p. 437</ref> The second reference appears in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'': In a manuscript Tolkien stated that "From [[Erech]] a road ran by [the] sea, skirting in a loop the '''hills of Tarnost''', and so to [[Ethir Anduin]] and the [[Lebennin]].".<ref>{{SD|Ir}}, pp. 15, 17</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] suggest that ''Tarnost'' appears to be an earlier name for ''[[Ethring]]'', as they share a "similar position on the published map".<ref>{{HM|AoL}}, p. 139</ref>

Tarnost also appears on the map of the [[White Mountains]] in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', identified by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad|Wynn Fonstad]] as a city<!-- Is Fonstad the source for the notion of a city? (User:Morgan) -->. The nearby hills are also named as the Hills of Tarnost.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', "The White Mountains", p. 88-89 (1991 edition only)</ref>

==Etymology==

It has been suggested that ''Tarnost'' is a [[Noldorin]] name, the second element perhaps being ''[[ost]]'' ("city").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1420740361.html|articlename=N.
