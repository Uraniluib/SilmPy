'''Adûnaic''' ("Language of the West") was the '''Númenórean''' language, spoken by the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] during the [[Second Age]].
==Origins and family==
Adûnaic was derived from the [[House of Hador|Hadorian]] tongue, related to the [[House of Bëor|Bëorian]]—collectively called [[Taliska]]. It was more distantly related to the languages of the [[Middle Men]] the east, such as the Men of [[Eriador]] and the [[Northmen]].<ref name=men>{{App|F1ii}}</ref> During the [[First Age]] these languages were much influenced by [[Khuzdul]],<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 317</ref> [[Avarin]], but also by the languages of the [[Eldar]], as the [[Elf-friends]] spoke [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>

Despite being a millennium or more after their separation, the Númenórean mariners who returned to [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Second Age]], after some close acquaintances they could find common roots and words with the [[Middle Men]] of [[Eriador]] (related to the Folks of Beor and Hador), and talk about simple matters.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> This is also partly due to the Númenórean longevity, and the slow change of their language.<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

In the western districts of Númenor, the rustic folk still used another dialect, a last remnant of the Bëorian language.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #71</ref>

Taliska was not related to the [[Haladin]] tongue at all, therefore the Númenóreans did not recognise the peoples of [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] as their distant kin, who spoke [[Pre-Númenórean|unrelated]] languages.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #72</ref>

==History==
Adûnaic was generally considered to be a language of less prestige than the [[Elvish|Elven tongues]]. Most locations of Númenor, and most of the lords and ladies of the [[Dúnedain]], had also [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]] names beside their native ones.<ref name=ak>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Even most commoners knew Sindarin to some degree. 

Most of the House of Bëor had been killed after the [[Dagor Bragollach]],<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> but even during the Second Age a Bëorian accent of Adûnaic still survived in parts of Númenor, most notably in [[Emerië]] and around the harbour of [[Andúnië]].
===Days of Pride===
About 2,000 years into the Second Age, the Númenóreans began to envy the immortality of the [[Firstborn]], which extended to the languages of the Elves; the Kings and their [[King's Men|followers]] used the Elven tongues less and less. Though the Kings and Queens had all taken their names in Quenya, after some time their supporters used their Adûnaic names to refer to them. 

Eventually [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]] took his name in Adûnaic and forbade anyone to speak the Elven tongues in his presence. Adûnaic was now the language of the royal court. Its supremacy was most strongly enforced by [[Ar-Gimilzôr]]: he outlawed the use of Elvish anywhere in Númenor, which antagonized the few [[Faithful]] Númenóreans still living in the land.

However, his son Inziladûn took a Quenya name again, [[Tar-Palantir]], repealed the ban on the Elven tongues and gave peace to the Faithful. His daughter [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]] would probably have continued his reforms, but her cousin [[Ar-Pharazôn|Pharazôn]] seized power and, in addition, gave her an Adûnaic name (Ar-Zimraphel).<ref name=ak/>

===Decline===
In Middle-earth, the [[Faithful]] settlers (who controlled the shorelands of the [[Westlands]] from [[Lune]] to [[Pelargir]]), neglected their native tongue and favored [[Sindarin]] and devised names in it; no doubt as a reaction against the rebel Kings who banned the Elvish tongues. This was the case among the Faithful of high lineage who used Sindarin as their native tongue, and became a mark of Númenórean descent, while Adûnaic was left as the daily language of the illiterate, neglected to unheeded change. However some Númenóreans who had Sindarin as their mother tongue, learned this "vulgar" language when it was needed.<ref name=atani/>

With the [[Downfall of Númenor]] came the end of classical Adûnaic. The study and preservation of the language was neglected by the Exiles of Númenor, because they associated it with the rebellious and repressive Númenórean Kings.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 315</ref> 

However, this debased tongue, spread from the early Númenórean sailors and colonists, continued to spread as their settlements increased in size and influence and met more peoples, who came under their rule. Those Men of different kinds used this language as a ''lingua franca'' among them. This process became of general importance after the [[Realms in Exile]]; from [[Eriador]] to [[Gondor]] the tongue became widely current, being adopted both by inhabitants and incomers, eventualy becoming their native language, which they called [[Westron]], widely spoken during the [[Third Age]].<ref name=atani/><ref>{{L|144}}</ref><ref name=men/>
