'''Weathertop''', known in [[Sindarin]] as '''Amon Sûl''', was the southernmost top of the [[Weather Hills]]. It stood a little away from the others, and its conical top was flattened.<ref name="Knife">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

Of old, it formed the boundary between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]].

==History==
===Early history===
The Weather Hills lay at the centre of [[Arnor]], near the [[East Road]] that split [[Eriador]].<ref>{{RK|Maps}}</ref>

A tower had stood on the hill since the days of [[Elendil]], and he had stored the ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' in its chambers. After King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] passed and the kingdom was split in three, all of his sons coveted the hill, or rather the [[Amon Sûl-stone|Stone]] inside. It lay on the exact tri-state point, but eventually passed to [[Arthedain]], the realm of [[Amlaith]], the eldest son of Eärendur, although it already possessed the [[Elostirion-stone|other]] [[Annúminas-stone|two]] Stones.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

===Destruction===
[[File:Fall of Amon Sul RotWK.png|250px|left|thumb|''The Fall of Amon Sûl'']]
In the days of [[Argeleb I|Argeleb]], the royal lines of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] had failed. Argeleb therefore claimed both realms as his own, hoping to reunite [[Arnor]], but the claim was resisted by Rhudaur, where the Dúnedain had dwindled and the land was now largely ruled by hillmen, who were driven by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]].

As tensions with Angmar increased, Argeleb fortified his border. A great bastion arose on Weathertop, and the East Road and lower Hoarwell were fortified also. For nigh half a century, the line held, though Argeleb lost his life in battle with the Hillmen. The Witch-king did not trouble the Men, and had sent his troops further East, to [[Rivendell]]. But in {{TA|1409}}, he came forth with such a force from Angmar that no army could stop him. He razed Amon Sûl and brought its mighty walls down.<ref name="Eriador"/> [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]], son of Argeleb, was slain,<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> but the Lord of the Nazgûl failed to retrieve the ''palantir''. It was secured and brought back to [[Fornost Erain]].<ref name="Eriador"/>

===In ruins===

For many centuries, the once great fortress stood in ruins on the hill. The locals paid little heed to it. It faded back into obscurity, and it was not until {{TA|3018}} the hill reappeared in the chronicles and annals. In early October, it was the scene of two fights involving the [[Nazgûl]]; one with [[Gandalf]] on [[3 October|October 3]] and one with [[Frodo Baggins|the Ring-bearer]] [[6 October|three days later]].<ref name="Chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref> After fleeing from Bree, [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]] avoided the main road and approached Weathertop from the north. At the top they discovered a cairn with a message from Gandalf, and spotted the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] approaching in the distance along the road. That night, the Ringwraiths attacked their camp in a dell below the summit, stabbing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] with a [[Morgul-knife]], but were driven off by the others.<ref name="Knife"/>

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Aragorn and the hobbits do not actually enter the ruins of Weathertop. However, moments before the attack of the Ringwraiths, a tall tower can be seen in the background.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:The fight with the Nazgûl has been moved from the camp near the hill to the ruins of the tower.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Weathertop is the fifth level. Aragorn has to take the four Hobbits to the hilltop, battling wolves and Orcs on the way there. At the top, they notice Gandalf had been there, and dropped a rune stone. As he explains it to Frodo, a troll attacks, and serves as the level's boss.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]]:'''
:Weathertop is the second level. Aragorn must drive the Nazgûl away before they kill Frodo.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Destroying Amon Sûl is the fourth level in the ''Angmar'' campaign in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. The bastion is protected by five mystical Mallorn trees: one generates a solar flare that incinerates enemies, one heals damaged buildings, one creates lush Elvish pastures (that boost the Men's armor and damage), one stuns targeted enemies and one summons a battalion of archers. The mission is completed when either all five mallorns are destroyed, or the tower falls.

:Additionally, two maps of Amon Sûl are available in Skirmish mode: one with the tower, which is identical to the mission save for the Mallorn trees, and one with the tower in ruins and all other buildings removed.

'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]:'''
:Weathertop is the meeting place between [[Azog]] and his lieutenants. Azog kills [[Yazneg]] for his failue to capture or kill [[Thorin and Company]].
