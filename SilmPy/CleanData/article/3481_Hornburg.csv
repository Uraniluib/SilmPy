The '''Hornburg''' (originally '''[[Súthburg]]''') was a great [[Gondor]]ian fortress later used by the [[Rohirrim]].

It was said among the Rohirrim that "no enemy has yet taken the Hornburg", and it was considered the strongest point in Rohan, stronger than [[Edoras]] and [[Dunharrow]].
==Geography==
The fortress was built in the western [[Calenardhon]] on [[Hornrock|a rock]] that was connected to the [[Deeping Wall]]. It guarded [[Helm's Deep|a deep valley]] nestled in the northeastern [[White Mountains]] below the [[Thrihyrne]].<ref name=deep/>

==History==
It was built by [[Gondorians]] in the days of the glory of [[Gondor]].<ref name=deep>{{TT|Deep}}</ref>

In later years whole regions of Gondor, such as [[Calenardhon]], were depopulated or evacuated. Therefore it came into the possession of [[Rohan]] and the master of [[Westfold]] dwelt there.

During the [[Dunlendings]]' occupation and [[Wulf]]'s usurpation, [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] sought refuge there during the [[Long Winter]]. It was renamed '''Hornburg''' because a horn sounded from its tower could be heard in the whole Deep.

During the [[War of the Ring]] it was commanded by [[Gamling]] the Old, and defended off a large-scale attack from [[Isengard]] during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].
