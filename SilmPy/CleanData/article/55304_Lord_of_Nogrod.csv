'''Lord of Nogrod''' was a title given to the one who ruled over the [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] city of [[Dwarf|Nogrod]]. 

Though there were presumably many Lords through the history of that [[First Age|Age]], only one appears in records, and even that Lord is not named. He led the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves|attack]] against [[Menegroth]] to capture the [[Nauglafring]]. Later he fought with [[Beren]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] and would have slain him, but stumbled and Beren slew him to reclaim the Nauglafring.  With his dying words, he cursed the treasure that he was bringing back to Nogrod, which Beren dumped in the river.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', [[Naugladur]] was the king of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]]<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 225</ref> who led the [[Battle of the Thousand Caves]] against [[Menegroth]] and fought with [[Beren]] in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]].
