'''RiffTrax''' are downloadable audio commentaries in which writer [[wikipedia:Michael J. Nelson|Mike Nelson]] and occasional guests heckle (or "riff") blockbuster movies. The concept was taken from Nelson's earlier sohw, ''[[wikipedia:Mystery Science Theater 3000|Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', in which old or bad B-movies were heckled. Due to copyright reasons, Nelson's new idea is sold online as a sound file which can be played over the DVD. 

Riffs were made of all three theatrical releases of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|the movie trilogy]]'':

* [[21 November|November 21]], [[2006]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', commentary by Nelson and [[wikipedia:Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]]
* [[23 May|May 23]], [[2008]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', commentary by Nelson, Murphy and [[wikipedia:Bill Corbett|Bill Corbett]]
* [[22 June|June 22]], [[2010]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', commentary by Nelson, Murphy and Corbett.
