{{Pronounce|Cardolan.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''Cardolan''' was a breakaway realm of the [[Dúnedain]] kingdom of [[Arnor]]. After the death of Arnor's King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], his sons divided the realm into the kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Rhudaur]] and Cardolan.

==Description==
The southeastern border of Cardolan followed the [[Gwathló]] and the [[Mitheithel]] to the [[Last Bridge]]. From there its boundary followed the [[Great East Road]] westward to the [[Brandywine Bridge]], and then down the [[Baranduin]] to the [[Belegaer|Sea]] and thence to the mouth of the Gwathló. However, Cardolan also claimed the land between [[Bree]] and the [[Weather Hills]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>  Notable features within Cardolan were the [[Old Forest]], the [[Barrow-downs]], the [[South Downs]], and the [[Greenway]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|861}} Arnor's tenth King, Eärendur, died.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Due to dissensions between his sons the realm was split into [[Arthedain]], [[Rhudaur]] and Cardolan.  While the line of [[Isildur]] continued in Arthedain, in both Rhudaur and Cardolan the line soon failed. The three kingdoms was led to strife because Arthedain held Weatherop and possessed its ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|Palantír]]'' as well as two others.<ref name="Eriador"/>
 
In {{TA|1050|n}} the [[Harfoots]] came into Eriador and in {{TA|1150|n}} they were joined by the [[Fallohides]].<ref name="TA"/>  It is likely that some of these [[Hobbits]] settled in Cardolan.
===War with Angmar=== 
Around {{TA|1272|n}}<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> [[Orcs]] began to trouble the region<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> and around {{TA|1300}}, the [[Witch-king]] founded the kingdom of [[Angmar]] north of the [[Ettenmoors]].  This event caused many Hobbits to move to [[Bree]].<ref name="TA"/>
 
No descendants of Isildur remained in Cardolan and Rhudaur and [[Argeleb I]] of Arthedain claimed lordship over all of former Arnor.  Rhudaur resisted this claim and made league with Angmar.<ref name="Eriador"/>  Argeleb I fell in battle with Rhudaur in {{TA|1356|n}}.<ref name="TA"/> Cardolan, and [[Lindon]], assisted his son, [[Arveleg I]], to avenge his father by pushing the enemy from the Weather Hills. For many years Arthedain and Cardolan held a frontier along the Hills, the [[East Road]] and the lower [[Hoarwell]].<ref name="Eriador"/>
 
However, in {{TA|1409}} a great host issued from Angmar and invaded Cardolan and took Weathertop. A remnant of the [[Dúnedain]] of Cardolan held out in the Barrow-downs and the [[Old Forest]].  The last prince of Cardolan was interred in the Barrow-downs in that year (some say that it was the tomb where [[Frodo Baggins]] was trapped during the [[War of the Ring]]).<ref name="Eriador"/>
 
In {{TA|1636}} those people who remained in the Barrow-downs died from the [[Great Plague]].  Angmar then sent [[Barrow-wights]] to infest and haunt the downs. Arthedain managed to reconquer the land briefly, but few people wished to live there on account of the Barrow-wights, and Cardolan was soon lost again.<ref name="Eriador"/>

===Legacy===
The region remained unpopulated even after the final fall of Arnor and destruction of Angmar ({{TA|1974|n}}<ref name="TA"/>).

On [[22 September]] {{TA|3018|n}} the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] entered Cardolan from the south.<ref name="TA"/>  While hunting for the [[One Ring]] their chief established himself in [[Andrath]] on the Greenway and then visited the Barrow-downs.  He stayed there for some days in order to rouse the [[Barrow-wights]].<ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref>

Presumably the area remained deserted until the reestablishment of the northern kingdom under king [[Aragorn|Elessar]] at the end of the Third Age.

==Etymology==
It is not known if [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] ever explained the name ''Cardolan''. The most common suggestion is that ''Cardolan'' likely is [[Sindarin]] for "red hill country". In that case, the name could be analyzed as ''[[caran|carn]]'' "red", ''[[dol]]'' "hill, mount" and ''[[-iand|an(n)]]'' "land".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 690</ref><ref name=Clewley/>

An alternative etymology has been suggested by Roger Clewley: ''Cardolan'' deriving from [[Noldorin]] ''car'' "house", ''dolen'' "hidden, secret", and the toponymical ending ''[[-iand|-and]]'', thus meaning "place/land of
hidden houses" (a reference to the "dead entombed there").<ref name=Clewley>{{webcite|author=Roger Clewley|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/36363|articlename=On the Name ''Cardolan'' (#36363)|dated=7 September 2012|website=[[Elfling]] (mailing list)|accessed=11 September 2012}}</ref>
