==Summary==
Tolkien told Miss Ronald that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] did not like weapons, but was not a pacifist in modern terms. He just thought physical fighting was less effective than good men deemed it. Tolkien went on to tell Miss Ronald of his Catholicism, and that history was but a long defeat, with only glimpses of final victory.
