The '''Gate of Wood''' was the first gate of the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin]].  It was placed at the end of the secret passage and the beginning of the [[Orfalch Echor]], in an arch bordered by pillars.  It was essentially a wooden portcullis that rose upon being touched in a certain place, an attribute which may have been cancellable in the case of siege.  It was followed by the [[Gate of Stone]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
