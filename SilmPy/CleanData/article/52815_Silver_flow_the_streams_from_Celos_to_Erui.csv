==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Silver flow the streams from [[Celos]] to [[Erui]]
In the green lands of [[Lebennin]]!
Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the [[Belegaer|Sea]]
The white lilies sway,
And the golden bells are shaken of [[mallos]] and [[alfirin]]
In the green fields of Lebennin,
In the wind from the Sea!
