==Excerpts==

{{quote|Tolkien responds in the first letter to the recipient's drawings for the work, which he finds 'extremely good ... Apart from their technical skill ... they not only in many cases correspond closely to my vision, but even enrich it. I was particularly delighted by [[Treebeard]] with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in his arms; but all your [[hobbits]] are admirable, and also the [[orcs]], and [[Gimli]]. I also thought the scene under "[[Weathertop]]" and the [[Witch-king|Witch-King]] powerful. It was tackled in the only possible way: making Frodo and the King visible and the other Companions shadowy ... [[Aragorn]] alone does not closely correspond to my vision ... I think of him as sterner, keener and in face less "Greek" and straight-nosed, more Roman'; Tolkien adds with regret however that 'the immediate prospects of an illustrated edition are not good'.|<ref name=Christies/>}}
