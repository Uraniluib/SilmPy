'''''hador''''' or '''''hadron''''' is a [[Noldorin]] word meaning "thrower of spears or darts". The word could also appear as a personal name, ''[[Hador (disambiguation)|Hador]]''.<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 363</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] continued to use the name ''Hador'' in the writings of the [[legendarium]] after the evolution from Noldorin to [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 234</ref> although it is unknown if he intended the Noldorin meaning to be retained.

In both [[David Salo]]'s and [[Didier Willis]]'s [[Neo-Elvish|Neo-Sindarin]] wordlists, ''hador'' and ''hadron'' ("thrower") appear as valid Sindarin forms.<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 334</ref><ref>[[Didier Willis]], [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/english.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary] at [http://www.jrrvf.com/haut.shtml Jrrvf.com] (accessed 20 July 2011)</ref>
