'''Rangers of the North''', or simply '''the Rangers''', were the northern wandering people of [[Eriador]], the last remnant of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] who had once peopled the North Kingdom of [[Arnor]]. They protected the lands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples consider them dangerous and distrustful in [[Bree]] and [[the Shire]], where they were known as "Watchers".

They were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark green, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.

The term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived in the southern lands of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]], perhaps to distinguish this people from their distant cousins, the [[Rangers of Ithilien]]. Like the Rangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the South-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the Northern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.
==Background==
The Dúnedain of Arnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the wars with [[Angmar]]. [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] soon fell and only the petty-kingdom of [[Arthedain]] maintained the noble line of [[Isildur]]. Finally, that too was destroyed in the [[Battle of Fornost]] and [[Arvedui]], the last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.

Arvedui's son and heir, [[Aranarth]] claimed the title of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]], who would rule the remnants of his people. [[Elrond]] had in his keeping the heirlooms of the house of [[Isildur]]: the shards of [[Narsil]], the [[Star of Elendil]], the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and later the [[Ring of Barahir]], ransomed from the [[Lossoth]]. 

Each of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to Isildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in [[Rivendell]].

The Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around [[Eriador]], far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their deeds were seldom recorded.

==History==
The [[Watchful Peace]] followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the enemies concentrated mostly against  [[Rhovanion]] and [[Gondor]]. During that time, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against [[orcs]] and [[wolves]] in order to keep the region safe. The [[hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] flourished under their protection.

During the rule of [[Arassuil]], the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] became more bold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying to hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were fought off by a party of brave Hobbits under [[Bandobras Took]] in {{TA|2747}}. Soon after, the [[Long Winter]] arrived and many lives were lost, and [[Gandalf]] and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive. 

In {{TA|2911|n}}, during [[Argonui]]'s rule, the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] began with the [[Brandywine]] freezing over. This was a catalyst for [[White Wolves]] invading Eriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last year of his reign, great floods devastated [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] leaving [[Tharbad]] ruined and deserted.  The following years were peaceful although [[Arador]] was killed by [[hill-trolls]] and his son [[Arathorn II]] was killed while hunting orcs.

Arathorn's son, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] succeeded him, who between {{TA|2957|n}} to {{TA|2980|n}} took great journeys, serving in the armies of King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], and Steward [[Ecthelion II]] of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened [[Sauron]] and his allies, and the West endured him during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

At that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When [[Halbarad]] led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in the War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company who fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]].

Aragorn eventually became King Elessar of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] and the Rangers became once more a united people under the line of [[Elendil]] in the [[Fourth Age]].

:The Rangers of the North are called simply Rangers in the game. There were some scattered about Middle-earth, but there were also many who were organized. There was a group that [[Aragorn]] led to keep track of the Enemy's movement during ''[[Stirrings in the Darkness]]''. The main Ranger factions in the game are the Rangers of Esteldín, the Wardens of [[Annúminas]], and the [[Grey Company]].
