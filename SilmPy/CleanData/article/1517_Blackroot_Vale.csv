The '''Blackroot Vale''', known as '''''Mornan''''' in [[Sindarin]],<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 14</ref> was a valley of rich grassland through which the River [[Morthond|Blackroot]] flowed.<ref name="Passing">{{RK|V2}}</ref> The river rose beneath the sheer mountainsides of the [[White Mountains]]' southern extent,<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> and in the shadowed rocks above its spring was the hidden gateway leading out from the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref name="Passing"/>

The people of the vale were known in [[Gondor]] for their archery skills, and their lord [[Duinhir]] took a small company of his bowmen to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> With them went [[Duinhir]]'s sons, [[Derufin]] and [[Duilin (son of Duinhir)|Duilin]], both of whom were lost in the defense of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

On [[8 March]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and the [[Grey Company]] exited the Paths of the Dead at the source of the Morthond.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  They rode to the [[Stone of Erech]] where Aragorn, as the heir of [[Isildur]], called upon the [[Oathbreakers]] to follow him and fulfill their pledge.<ref name="Passing"/>

==Etymology==
[[Carl F. Hostetter]] has suggested that the name ''Mornan'' consists of ''[[mor|mor-]]'' ("dark") + ''[[nan]]'' (valley).<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 29 (note 31)</ref>

==Portrayal in Adapations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Blackroot Vale was an area in the region of Western Gondor. It was accessed by traveling from "Kingstead" in Western [[Rohan]] through the [[Paths of the Dead]]. [[Tarlang's Neck]] connected the Vale to [[Lamedon]] in the southeast. The Havens of [[Belfalas]] lay to the south, connected by a road that runs through "Tarlang's Crown" on the west side of "Tarlang's Peaks". The capital was "Morlad", built upon a hill on the western shore of the river [[Morthond]], south of the entrance to the [[Dwimorberg]]. Further south along the river were the villages of "Alagrant" and "Sardol". East of Morlad, on the other side of the [[Hill of Erech]], were the mining village of "Tingobel" and the town of "Lancrath".

:The Vale faced several threats in March of {{TA|3019}}, during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Orcs]] of the [[White Mountains]] captured Tingobel, [[Umbar]]rim [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] and sorcerors held Tarlang's Crown, and some of the cursed [[Oathbreakers]] had rejected [[Aragorn]]'s offer and reaffirmed their allegiance to [[Sauron]]. These twice-traitorous shades called themselves the Ruthless Dead, and the fear they spread was driving the local fauna to madness and death. "Malthellam" was Steward of the Vale in Lord [[Duinhir]]'s absence. He required the cooperation of Duinhir's wife, the Lady Rosfin, but Rosfin blamed him for the loss of Tingobel and was initially reluctant to work with him. The emblem of the Blackroot Vale was a black circle on a white field.
