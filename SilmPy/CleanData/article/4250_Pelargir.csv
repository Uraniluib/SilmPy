'''Pelargir''' was a great city on the river [[Anduin]], and the main harbour of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Pelargir was built in {{SA|2350}} as a haven of the [[Faithful]].<ref name=b1>{{App|B1}}</ref> The [[King's Men]] established havens farther South.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> It had in its early days been a city only a few miles away from the coasts, but after the [[Downfall of Númenor]] the coasts along the [[Bay of Belfalas]] had retreated a great distance and the city was left far inland.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> Pelargir was one of the cities that assembled [[Gondor]] when it was founded in {{SA|3320}} by the Faithful.<ref name=b1/>

It became an even greater haven in the days of the [[Ship-kings]]. [[Tarannon Falastur]] built a great house there, with its roots in the water which he so dearly loved. His wife, [[Berúthiel]], did not, however, and preferred to live in [[Osgiliath]] with her [[Cats of Queen Berúthiel|cats]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Tarannon's nephew [[Eärnil I]], who succeeded him, rebuilt Pelargir and built a great navy to conquer [[Umbar]].<ref name="Anarion">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

[[Castamir]] was highly loved in the shore regions of the land, and when he usurped the throne, he purposed to move the throne from Osgiliath to Pelargir.<ref name="Anarion"/> Though he did not do so, he did move his base there. [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] turned the tide in the [[Kin-strife]] at the [[Battle of the Crossings of Erui]] in {{TA|1447}}, and Castamir's family, supporters and ships retreated to Pelargir. Eldacar [[Siege of Pelargir|besieged them by land]] until they were driven out, making their way to Umbar.<ref name="Anarion"/><ref name="tTA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Castamir's great-grandsons [[Angamaitë]] and [[Sangahyando]] eventually retook Pelargir in {{TA|1634|n}}, and slew king [[Minardil]].<ref name="Anarion"/><ref name="tTA"/>

Like his namesake, the great general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] took up residence in Pelargir. His Army of the South was stationed there during the [[Wainrider/Balchoth War|long war with the Balchoth]]. News of the [[Disaster of the Morannon]] reached him on [[9 July]] {{TA|1944|n}}, and he set out to [[Battle of the Camp|battle]]. He returned victorious, and with the King and his sons slain, the general (of royal blood) was crowned King Eärnil II.<ref>{{HM|UT}}, "[[Cirion and Eorl]]"</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], Pelargir was overrun by [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] once again. Their fleet of some fifty great ships and many more smaller vessels laid in dock, ready to sail to [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]]. It was not to be: [[Aragorn]] and the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men of Dunharrow]] struck fear into the men of Umbar, and they fled or dove into the river [[Anduin]]. After manning the Black Ships with [[Grey Company|his own troops]], Aragorn released the spell that had haunted the Dead Men since the day of [[Isildur]].<ref name="tLD"/>

==Etymology==
''Pelargir'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Garth of (the) Royal Ships".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 535 (citing from the [[Unfinished index]])</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the first element derives from the [[Elvish]] element/root ''[[PEL|pel-]]'' ("go round, encircle");<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> the two other elements appear to be ''[[ar|ar(a)]]'' ("royal, noble") + ''[[cair|cîr]]'' ("ships").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#P Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 13 July 2011)</ref>

==Inspiration==

[[Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955)|Writing in a letter]] about an impending trip in [[1955]], Tolkien identified Pelargir as [[Wikipedia:Venice|Venice]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 462</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Pelargir appears on a map when Gandalf explains the coming of the Black Ships.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Pelargir is one of the settings in which skirmishes can be fought.

'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Pelargir was built around the meeting of the rivers [[Sirith]] and [[Anduin]], on the eastern border of the Lower [[Lebennin]] area and the Central [[Gondor]] region, west of Upper Lebennin and Eastern Gondor. [[Aragorn]]'s retaking of Pelargir was featured in an Epic Battle and served as the climax of Book 2 of [[The Strength of Sauron|Volume IV]]. The city's emblem was a blue anchor on a white background, with gold trim. The city was divided into the West-garth, the East-garth, the Market Ward, the Shipwrights' Ward, the Court of the Ship-Kings, and Tol Ciryarani, though the latter was rendered inaccessible by a collapsed bridge by the time Aragorn liberated the city. Argillond, the Harbor of Royal Ships, was partitioned from the rest of the Great River by two sea-gates, one on the east and one on the west.

:Sirgon was Lord of the city during the [[War of the Ring]], and was captured and spirited away by [[Haradrim]] slavers when the city was captured. Sirgon's son Faltharan and his captain Thandor took command of the city following its liberation. Faltharan managed to rescue his mother and siblings, only to soon discover his brother Lorvegil had betrayed the city to the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]], allowing it to fall. After apprehending Lorvegil, Faltharan discovered and rescued their father at the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] Sirthanc in Upper Lebennin.
