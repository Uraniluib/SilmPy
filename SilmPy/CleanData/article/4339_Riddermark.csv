'''Riddermark''' or simply '''the Mark''' was the name among the [[Rohirrim]] for the land, more commonly known to outsiders as [[Rohan]].<ref name=RC248>{{HM|RC}}, p. 248</ref>

==Etymology==

''Riddermark'' means "land of the riders", derived from the [[Old English]] compound ''Riddena-''[[Wiktionary:Mearc|''mearc'']] ("riders' mark"<ref>[[Jason Fisher]], "Horns of Dawn: The Tradition of Alliterative Verse in Rohan", in ''[[Middle-earth Minstrel|Middle-earth Minstrel: Essays on Music in Tolkien]]'' (ed. Bradford Lee Eden), p. 21 (note 18)</ref> or "The Territory of the Knights"<ref>Greg Harvey, ''The Origins of Tolkien's Middle-earth for Dummies'', "The Rohirrim"</ref>). ''[[Wikipedia:March (territory)|Mark]]'' here is used in the sense of "borderland, especially one serving as a defence of the inner lands of a realm".<ref name=RC248/> 

The original untranslated [[Rohirric]] term of the country was ''[[L≈çgrad]]''.<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 53</ref>
==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] might have been inspired by [[William Morris]]'s use of 'Mid-mark' in ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'', a book which Tolkien owned and from which he took inspiration.<ref name=CGMorris>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', "Morris, William", p. 600</ref>
