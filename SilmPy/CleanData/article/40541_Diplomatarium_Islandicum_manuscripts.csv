"The appearance of the _Ethiopians_ at this point in the account is 
clearly, in part at least, due to a comparison of Psalm lxxiii with the 
book of Exodus. It is probable too that v. 16 of the psalm ("The day is 
thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the 
sun") was brought into relation with the mention, in Exod. xiii 21, of 
the pillars of cloud and fire immediately after _Etham_.

_byrig_ is probably plural, as noted above: 'the cities of the region of 
Etham'. See quot. in note p. 32. In any case, of course, _Etham_ 
(_Æthan_) is taken not as a city or place, but a region; _Æthanes byrig_ 
in O.E. does not mean 'the city of Etham', where city = Etham, but 'the 
city belonging to or in Etham'.

67 _mearelandum ón_ : a good example of a manuscript accent indicating 
emphasis and stress (here properly borne by the 'postponed' _on_ in 
archaic word order) and not quantity. The words render _in extremis 
finibus solitudinis_. [Vulgate Exodus 13:20]

68 _nearwe genyddon_ : it is a little difficult to interpret these words
