'''The Ent's Marching Song''' is a song chanted by the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] as they marched on [[Isengard]]. It appears in the chapter "[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]".

The chant began with a loud cry of "''ra-hoom-rah!''" and was accompanied by a sound like the rolling beats and booms of solemn drums.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
We come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!

We come, we come with horn and drum: ta-rūna rūna rūna rom!

To Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;
Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,
We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;
For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars - we go to war!
To land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;
To Isengard with doom we come!
With doom we come, with doom we come!
