The '''Enchanted River''' rose in the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]], and flowed northwards in a great loop to meet the [[Forest River]] under the canopy of the trees of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> Its water was black, and carried a curse that gave the river its name - any person coming into contact with its enchanted water immediately fell into a long, deep sleep.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

About halfway along its length, the Enchanted River flowed across the [[Elf-path]] that led west to east through Mirkwood to the [[Elvenking's Halls]], and it seems that a ferry was maintained there, presumably for the use of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]]. At least, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Dwarves]] found a boat kept on the eastern bank of the River, which they used to cross it on their journey to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. However, [[Bombur]] fell in the river and lost consciousness, and his companions had to pull him out and carry him for several days with ropes.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>
