The first line names three trees that Bregalad was especially fond of that are now gone, cut down by [[Orcs]] from [[Isengard]].  Bregalad softly sings in many tongues and the two hobbits fall asleep to the sound of his voice.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
O [[Orofarnë]], [[Lassemista]], [[Carnimírië]]! 
O [[rowan]] fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay! 
O rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer's day, 
Your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft: 
Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft! 
O rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey; 
Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day. 
O Orofarnë, Lassemista, Carnimírië!
