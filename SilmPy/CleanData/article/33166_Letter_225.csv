==Summary==
Tolkien thanked [[Rayner Unwin]] for the news that [[Wikipedia:Puffin Books|Puffin Books]] had offered to publish a paperback edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and left the decision to his own wisdom.  Tolkien had mixed feelings: He was not able to ignore cash-profit, even to the odd Â£100, but shared Unwin's reluctance to cheapen the old ''Hobbit''.  Unless advantage was clear he would rather let him amble along.  Tolkien said he was not fond of Puffins or Penguins for they ate other birds' eggs.
