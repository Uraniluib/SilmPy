The name given to the calendar system used in [[Númenor]] throughout the [[Second Age]], and in [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] throughout much of the [[Third Age]]. It divided the year into twelve months (properly called [[astar]]), and included three days that did not belong to any month: [[yestarë]], [[loëndë]] and [[mettarë]]. The King's Reckoning lasted until the loss of [[Eärnur]] the last [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]. It was revised by [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], the first [[Ruling Steward]], who replaced it with the system known as the [[Stewards' Reckoning]].<ref name="D2">{{App|D2}}</ref>

==Structure==
The year was divided into twelve months, with three days outside the months. These divisions are given in the table below.

!Relationship to the [[Shire Calendar]]<ref group=note>Based on the statement in [[Appendix D]] that the day of the destruction of the [[One Ring]], Shire [[25 March]] in {{TA|3019}}, "was, however, March 25 in both Kings' and Stewards' Reckoning." This may only apply around the end of the Third Age, since it is unknown if the [[Shire Calendar]] incorporated the Kings' Reckoning 2-day "millennial additions" or any of the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] additional adjustments.</ref>

In leap years, [[loëndë]] was replaced with two [[enderi]]; this occurred in years divisible by 4 but not by 100 (''[[haranyë]]''), resulting in a 366-day year, similar to modern [[wikipedia:Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar]] leap years. In addition, in years divisible by 1000 loëndë was replaced by three enderi{{fact}}, resulting in a 367-day year. These leap year rules held throughout the [[Second Age]] and continued based on the restarted numbering of [[Third Age]] years, and the 2-day "millennial additions" continued through {{TA|2000}}. This calendar was replaced by the [[Stewards' Reckoning]] in {{TA|2060}}.<ref name="D2" />

According to [[Jim Allan]] in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', each of the elvish month names has a correspondence to the months of the [[Wikipedia:French Republican Calendar|French Republican Calendar]]; for example, Nénimë/Pluviôse mean "Rainy", Súlìmë/Ventôse mean "Windy". Jim Allan suggests that Tolkien used this similarity because the French Republican Calendar was based on earlier unrecorded Germanic month names.<ref name="allan">{{HM|IE}}, p. 151</ref><!-- check chapter heading -->

==Days of the week==
When the Kings' Reckoning was first implemented the Númenóreans used the elven week of six days. At unspecified points of the [[Second Age]] two changes were made, the first being to rename the fourth day Aldúya to Aldëa (Orgaladh in Sindarin) in order to change the dedication to the [[White Tree]], and the second being to insert an extra day, Eärenya (Oraearon), after the fifth day Menelya.<ref name="D2" /> Thus, the eventual Númenórean week was as follows:
