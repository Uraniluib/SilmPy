==Text==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Sing now, ye people of the Tower of Anor,
for the Realm of Sauron is ended for ever,
and the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] is thrown down.

Sing and rejoice, ye people of the Tower of Guard,
for your watch hath not been in vain,
and the [[Black Gate]] is broken,
and your [[Aragorn|King]] hath passed through,
and he is victorious.

Sing and be glad, all ye children of the West,
for your King shall come again,
and he shall dwell among you
all the days of your life.

And the [[White Tree of Gondor|Tree]] that was withered shall be renewed, 
and he shall plant it in the high places,
and the City shall be blessed.

Sing all ye people!
</poem>
