'''Eregion''' ([[Sindarin|S]], pron. {{IPA|[eˈreɡjon]}}) or '''Hollin''' was a sub-realm of the [[Noldor|Noldorin]] [[Elves]] in [[Eriador]] during the [[Second Age]], located near the [[Walls of Moria]] under the shadow of the [[Misty Mountains]]. It was the only lasting Noldorin realm outside [[Lindon]].<Ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref>
==History==
Eregion was founded by the Noldor who left from Lindon early in the Second Age.
Its capital was [[Ost-in-Edhil]], which was founded in {{SA|750}}.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

The Elves of Eregion lived in harmony with a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] civilization, trading freely with their kingdom of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], or ''Hadhodrond'' in the [[Sindarin|Elven tongue]]. A high road ran from Ost-in-Edhil to Khazad-dûm, and an unprecedented friendship between the two races began in that time. Eregion's jewel smiths achieved the highest levels of craftsmanship since [[Fëanor]]. <ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

Eregion was populated by Noldor, and for a while ruled by [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]], until they left for [[Lothlórien]] on the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]. It was then ruled by [[Celebrimbor]], a descendant of [[Fëanor]]. Under his rule the Elves of Eregion became friends with [[Annatar]], the "Lord of Gifts," and created the [[Rings of Power]]. When Annatar was revealed as the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], the Elves of Eregion tried to keep the Rings from falling into Sauron's hands, but only managed to rescue [[Vilya]], [[Narya]], and [[Nenya]] (the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves).
 
Sauron returned to Hollin with a vengeance in {{SA|1697|n}}, and despite the assistance of the Dwarves, he [[Sack of Eregion|utterly destroyed]] it. The survivors fled to [[Lindon]], Lothlórien, and the refuge of Imladris ([[Rivendell]]). The doors of Moria were shut and sealed, and Celebrimbor was slain.

In the [[Third Age]], Eregion was a pleasant but unpopulated land. 

==Etymology==
The name ''Eregion'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Land of Holly"<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref> (the word ''[[ereg]]'' means "holly").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''ereg''</ref>

''Hollin'' (from ''hollin-land'') is an old form, still used locally, of "[[holly]]"; the region abounded in holly-trees.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref>
