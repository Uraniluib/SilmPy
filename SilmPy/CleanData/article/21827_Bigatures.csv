'''Big-atures''' or '''Bigatures''' are terms referring to miniature models created by [[Weta Workshop]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] movies. Because of their size, Christy Hennah named them big-atures.

From the pre-production of the films, Peter Jackson had decided to create small-size models of structures to the last detail and then add some digital work, instead of creating these locations fully digital. Some of the Big-atures Weta created include:

*'''[[Minas Tirith]]'''
Minas Tirith was built in a 1/72 scale and some of its parts in a 1/14 scale for closer scenes. According to the Extended DVD edition of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], it required almost 1000 houses to be completed, and its height was around 7 meters.

*'''[[Morannon]]'''

*'''[[Cirith Ungol]]'''
[[John Howe]] revisited the original drawings based on Tokien's writings, and the model was built on a rocky pinnacle instead directly on the mountain, Cirith Ungol constructed highly detailed with various gothic elements.


*'''[[Helm's Deep]]'''
*'''[[Orthanc]]'''
*'''[[Barad-dûr]]'''
*'''[[Minas Morgul]]'''
*'''[[Osgiliath]]'''
*'''[[Lothlórien|Lothlorien]]'''
*'''[[Moria]]'''
*'''[[Mithlond]]'''
