'''Marigold Cotton (née Gamgee)''' was the youngest child of [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]].

==History==
Like all Gamgees, Marigold was close to the [[Cotton Family]]. She married [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom Cotton]], the eldest son of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]]. Marigold's brother, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], married Tom's sister [[Rose Cotton|Rose]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Marigold" (from ''Mary'' + ''gold'') refers to the ''[[wikipedia:Tagetes|Tagetes]]'' annual plants of the daisy family.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] picked the name since it contains "gold" and referring to a golden flower, suggesting the [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] strain in Sam's family — which, increased by the favour of [[Galadriel]], became notable in his children.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>
