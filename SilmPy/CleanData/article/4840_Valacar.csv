}}'''Valacar''' ({{TA|1194}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1432|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 238 years) was the twentieth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Valacar's father, [[Rómendacil II]], led a large army that in {{TA|1248}} defeated the [[Easterlings]] in the lands beyond the [[Anduin]].  In this same region also dwelt numerous groups of [[Northmen]], of which the most powerful was [[Vidugavia]], who aided [[Gondor]] in the fight against the Easterlings.  Rómendacil wished to strengthen the bond with the "[[King of Rhovanion]]", so in {{TA|1250|n}} he sent Valacar as Gondor's ambassador to Vidugavia.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Valacar was charged with learning the language, manners, and policies of the [[Northmen]].  What was not foreseen was that he would become so enamoured of the people and lands of the North that he would want to marry Vidugavia's daughter, [[Vidumavi]].<ref name="Gondor"/>  Rómendacil gave his consent to this marriage so as to not antagonize Vidugavia or the Northmen in Gondor's service.  Valacar and Vidumavi continued to live in the north and produced a son named [[Vinitharya]], after the fashion of Vidumavi's people.  Rómendacil finally recalled his son to Gondor in {{TA|1260|n}}; when Valacar arrived he brought his family as well as a household of noble men and women from the North.<ref>{{PM|Ai}}</ref>

The news that the heir to the throne had married a woman of a lesser and alien race did not sit well with the high men of Gondor.  Vidumavi was short-lived according to the measure of the [[Dúnedain]] and they feared that her descendants would prove likewise, thus diminishing the majesty of Gondor's royalty.  This fear, plus the distaste of the people of Gondor for the Northmen who had come into the realm, led to unrest and then rebellion (especially in the southern fiefs) when Valacar grew old.  Upon his death Valacar's son, now called [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], had to face civil war during the period called the [[Kin-strife]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Valacar'' is [[Quenya]], a compound of ''[[Vala]]'' and the suffixal form ''-car'' of ''[[karma|carma]]'' "helm", also seen in [[Eldacar]] "Elf-helm".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 114</ref>
