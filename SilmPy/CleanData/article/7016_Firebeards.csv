The '''Firebeards''' were one of the seven houses of the [[Dwarves]]. They were originally paired with the [[Broadbeams]]. The ancestor of the Firebeards was among the oldest (together with the ancestors of the [[Broadbeams]] and [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]]) of the Seven Ancestors of the Dwarves.<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref>

The Firebeards (with the Broadbeams) awoke in [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] in the [[Blue Mountains]], and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the Blue Mountains, and dwelt in them before their ruining in the [[War of Wrath]]. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  In an [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|earlier version of the legendarium]] the two cities are clearly inhabited by separate houses; however, Belegost is said to be the home of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]].<ref name="#">{{LT2|IV}}</ref>

In the [[Second Age]], around the year {{SA|40|n}},<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> the Firebeards and Broadbeams who lived in Nogrod and Belegost left the destruction behind and came to [[Khazad-dûm]], increasing its wealth and power.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''
: The House corresponding to the Firebeards is called '''Úri's Folk''', said to being "''instantly recognizable by the fiery hue of their beards''". After the destruction of Nogrod, some of Úri's Folk went to join the Longbeards at Khazad-dûm, while others delved new halls in the southern Ered Luin.<ref>{{D|M}}</ref>
