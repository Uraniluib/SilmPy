'''Drúadan Forest''' was in the fief of [[Anórien]], in [[Gondor]], lying north of the eastern end of the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]].  Located near or in the Forest were three of [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Gondor's warning beacons]]: To the west was [[Nardol]], within the woods was [[Eilenach]], and just east of the woods was [[Amon Dîn]].  Skirting the northern edge of Drúadan Forest was the great road that connected Gondor to [[Rohan]], while within the southern part of the forest was the long-abandoned road through [[Stonewain Valley]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

It was avoided by the people of Gondor and [[Rohan]], who believed it was haunted: in reality the forest was home to a small enclave of [[Drúedain]], or ''Woses'', who only survived in these woods and in the [[Drúwaith Iaur]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, p. 383</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], a host of [[Orcs]] was found by scouts of the [[Rohirrim]] three miles west of Amon Dîn upon the Great West Road and moving toward [[Théoden]]'s forces.  A leader of the Woses, [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] came forward and offered to lead the [[Rohirrim]] by secret paths through the forest so they could avoid the Orcs.  Taking the forgotten road down Stonewain Valley the riders of [[Rohan]] were able to come to [[Pelennor Fields]] undetected.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>

In exchange for this help the forest was later given to the Drúedain as a protected enclave inside the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

The name of the forest apparently means "Forest of the Drúedain".
