{{Quote|No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at the The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road...|[[A Long-expected Party]]}}

The '''Ivy Bush''' was an inn located on [[Bywater Road]] in [[the Shire]]. 

==History==
The Ivy Bush was frequented by the [[Hobbits]] of [[Hobbiton]] and [[Bywater]]. It was here that [[Gaffer Gamgee]] got quite an audience who were interested in the stories he told about  [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
The Ivy Bush is the name of a public house located on Hagley Road, [[Birmingham]], England.<ref>Fiona Glass, "[http://wulfwaru.wordpress.com/2008/09/06/its-official-hobbiton-is-really-birmingham/ It’s official – Hobbiton is really… Birmingham?!]", ''[http://wulfwaru.wordpress.com/ The Britwriters]'', [[8 September|September 8]], [[2008]]</ref> When [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] lived on Stirling Road this would have been his local hostelry and could be found halfway between his house and the [[Birmingham Oratory]], where he worshiped for a time.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Ivy Bush is a two-story building located at Bywater's market. Unlike the [[Green Dragon]], which is on the other side of the market, the Ivy Bush plays no part in the story.
