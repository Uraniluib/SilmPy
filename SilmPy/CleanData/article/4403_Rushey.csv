==Etymology==
The name means "Rush-isle". [[David Salo]] has suggested an [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] etymology from *''Ryscieg''.<ref name=Salo>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/121|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]}}</ref> ''[[Wiktionary:ey#Old_Norse|-ey]]'' or ''-y'' in English place-names has the sense "small island", as seen in [[Girdley]].<ref name="Nomen"/>

It was called so as "''a 'hard' among the fens of the Marish''"<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref> forming an isolated "island" in the midst of the soggy ground; this nomenclature is also seen in the [[Wikipedia:Isle of Ely|Isle of Ely]].<ref name=Salo/> 

The name is spelled as "Rushy" on [[A Part of the Shire]].<ref name=Part/><ref name=Salo/>
