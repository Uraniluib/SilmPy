'''Coffee''' was a beverage known at least by the [[Hobbits]] and the [[Dwarves]] in the Third Age. When [[Bilbo Baggins]] entertained [[Thorin and Company]] and [[Gandalf]] in [[Bag End]] in April {{TA|2941}}, he had to set a big jug of coffee in the hearth, because one of the five dwarves who entered together ([[Dori]], [[Ori]], [[Nori]], [[Oin]], and [[Gloin]]) asked for it.<ref>{{H|1}}</ref>

Coffee is not mentioned elsewhere in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and it is not mentioned at all in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
