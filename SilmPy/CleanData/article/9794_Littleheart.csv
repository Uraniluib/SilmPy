'''Littleheart''', his real name being '''Ilfrin''', was an [[Elves|elf]] of [[Tol Eressëa]], who told the tales of the [[Fall of Gondolin]] and the [[Nauglafring]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. In his own tale of the Nauglafring it was said by [[Gilfanon]] that only Littleheart son of [[Voronwë|Bronweg]] had seen the Nauglafring and still was alive.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 228</ref>

In the earlier [[legendarium]], the ''Book of Lost Tales'' included, he was named '''Ilfiniol''' (also '''Elfriniol''', '''Elfriniel''', and '''Ilfrith''', '''Elfrith''').<ref>{{HM|IX}}, pp. 126, 237</ref>
