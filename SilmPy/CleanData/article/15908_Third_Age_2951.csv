==Note==
As of [[2015]], the published version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' includes entries for the year 2951 that: [[Elrond]] reveals to [[Aragorn]] his true name and ancestry; Aragorn meets [[Arwen]] in [[Rivendell]]; and Aragorn goes into the Wild. Following research by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] agrees that this is in error and the correct year for these entries should be {{TA|2952}}.<ref>{{webcite|website=HS|author=[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]|articleurl=http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/tolkien-notes-13/|articlename=Tolkien Notes 13|dated=25 December 2015|accessed=7 January 2016}}</ref> Tolkien Gateway reflects this.
