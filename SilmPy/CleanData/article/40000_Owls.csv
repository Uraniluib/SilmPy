'''Owls''' are solitary nocturnal birds of prey.  They must have been fairly common in the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]] in the [[Third Age]], for when the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] sent [[Bilbo Baggins]] to spy on the Trolls he was told that if he could not come back he was to "hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a screech-owl".  Thus the Dwarves assumed that Bilbo was familiar with the exact calls that these two types of owls produced.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>  Much later, on the first night with [[Beorn]], Bilbo thought he could hear the hoot of owls in the rafters of the hall.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

==Tolkien's life==

In [[1928]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made an illustration of "Owlamoo", an evil owl who appeared in nightmares of his child [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]].<ref>Judith Priestman, ''[[Tolkien: Life and Legend]]'', pp. 44, 53</ref>
