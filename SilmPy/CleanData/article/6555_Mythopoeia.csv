'''Mythopoeia''' (Greek, "mythos-making") is the title of a poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and the name of a term coined by him. 

"Mythopoeia" was created as reaction to [[C.S. Lewis]]' statement that myths were "lies breathed through silver." The poem takes a position opposed to rationalism and materialism, referring to the creative human author as "the little maker" wielding his "own small golden sceptre" ruling his [[Sub-creation]] (understood as genuine Creation within God's primary Creation).

While quoted in "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" (1947), and mentioned by [[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' (1977), the poem was first published in its entirety in the 1988 edition of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 620-2</ref>

==Fragment==
''<poem>I will not treat your dusty path and flat, 
denoting this and that by this and that, 
your world immutable wherein no part 
the little maker has with maker's art. 
I bow not yet before the Iron Crown, 
nor cast my own small golden sceptre down.</poem>''
