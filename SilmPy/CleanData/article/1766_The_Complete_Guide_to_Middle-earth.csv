}}'''''The Complete Guide to Middle-earth''''' is a reference book for the fictional universe of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], compiled and edited by [[Robert Foster]].

Originally published in [[1971]] as ''A Guide to Middle-Earth'', before the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the first edition contained only information from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''. In [[1978]], a new edition (''The Complete Guide to Middle-earth: from The Hobbit to The Silmarillion''), containing material from ''The Silmarillion'', was published. 

A revised edition was published in [[2001]], as one of many reprints intended to ride the commercial wave of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].

In the Introduction to the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' (p. 6), [[Christopher Tolkien]] mentions that he has been using the Guide frequently, and commends it as "an admirable work of reference".

==Structure==
A typical entry of the encyclopedia contains: a name; the language it belongs to; its translation from [[Elvish]], [[Adûnaic]] and sometimes [[Old English]] when known; and known dates when a character flourished; the first lines of the entry usually give a general definition of the topic, like race, heritage and role (in case of a character), leading to a chronological description or biography. The last paragraphs of the entry give a physical description or characteristics of the character with some speculations; the final paragraph gives the topic's alternative names, epithets, translation to other languages, and/or redirects to other entries.

The Guide is generally inclusive and there is no limitation to the topics it covers; it includes even obscure and little explored topics, like individual entries on each single [[Tengwar]] names. Many entries are simply epithets and only redirect to the names of their main entries.

The book begins with an introduction, an abbreviations legend and concludes with two appendices. The first appendix is a [[Timeline/First Age|chronology]] of the [[First Age]] in order to complement the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]], and contains a prologue on Foster's reasoning and calculations based solely on descriptions in the ''Silmarillion''; the second appendix is genealogical trees of the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]], the [[Kings of Númenor]], the [[Kings of Gondor]] and [[Kings of Arnor|Arnor]], the [[House of Húrin]] and the [[Kings of Rohan]].

==Accuracy==
No edition of the book includes info on post-''Silmarillion'' material (i.e. ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series) and therefore in points it is outdated or in error. 
*'''Introduction''': It is explained that death dates of those who sailed to the West are not given in their characters' entries "for they live still". While this can be true for [[Gandalf]] and the [[Elves]], this is also implied for [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gimli]]. This seems to contradict Tolkien's concept that the Undying Lands don't grant [[immortality]]<ref>{{L|154}}</ref><ref>{{L|246}}</ref>.

*'''[[Tar-Aldarion]]''': Foster speculates that the tragic relations with his [[Tar-Meneldur|father]] and [[Erendis|wife]] were because he left no male heirs. The later published text ''[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife|Aldarion and Erendis]]'' gives a detailed account on their relationship, mostly owing to Aldarion's obsession with [[the Sea]].

*'''[[Ambar]]''': Foster relates the [[Elvish]] words ''ambar'' "world" and ''[[umbar]]'' "fate". In the entry of Ambar, he mentions it is a concept related to fate of the world. The manuscript ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Words Phrases and Passages]]'' later showed that while the two words are indeed related (through the [[Sundocarme|root]] [[MBAR]] "settle"), they are distinct in meaning.

*'''[[Aragorn]]''': Foster gives the [[Sindarin]] meaning of Aragorn as "royal-tree". The name actually means "revered king", which is also stated in ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Words Phrases and Passages]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 113</ref>

*'''[[Elendilmir|Star of Elendil]]''': The royal symbol Elendilmir, and the [[Star of the Dúnedain]] given by [[Aragorn]] to [[Samwise Gamgee]] are mistaken to be the same. [[Christopher Tolkien]] refuted this.<ref>{{UT|7}}, Footnote 33, p. 284</ref>

===Possible Inaccuracies===
*'''[[Bladorthin]]''': Foster supports the usual misunderstanding that Bladorthin's spears were not delivered because he died early; while the text mentions those events closely to imply that they are connected, it doesn't really mention his death as premature or as a reason for the failed delivery.<ref>[[Andreas Möhn]], "[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bladorthin.html Who was the King Bladorthin?]"</ref>

*'''[[Buckland]]''': The date {{FoA|42}} is mentioned as the date when Buckland and the [[Westmarch]] were officially added to the [[Shire]] by the gift of King [[Elessar]]. There are two mistakes in this statement: 1. The date has been corrected as {{SR|1452}} in later editions of the ''Lord of the Rings''; 2. Tolkien did not mention that Buckland joined the Shire: in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Prologue|Prologue]]'' a semi-colon is intended to show that the Westmarch was added, but not Buckland.<ref>See [[Buckland#Part_of_the_Shire.3F|here]] and the [[Talk:Buckland|discussion here]]</ref>

*'''[[Dolmed]]''': Foster suggests that the mountain was destroyed at the end of the [[First Age]] when the [[Gulf of Lune]], broke through the [[Blue Mountains]]; while the text doesn't mention anything about it.<ref>[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/ Hiswelókë], "[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Mont Dolmed & cités naines]"</ref>

*'''[[Gollum]]''': Foster mentions that [[Déagol]] was [[Sméagol]]'s cousin while this is not mentioned in the texts. Tolkien went only as far as to suppose he was "evidently a relative (as no doubt all the members of the small community were)"<ref>{{L|214}}</ref>

*'''[[Gwaihir]]''': Foster reproduces the fan conception merging the character of the [[Great Eagle]] of ''The Hobbit'' to that of [[Gwaihir]], whereas nowhere is it implied in ''Lord of the Rings'' that Gwaihir is [[Lord of the Eagles]].

*'''[[Mearas]]''': Foster mentions the singular of ''mearas'' as ''meara'' (cf. entries for [[Shadowfax]] and [[Snowmane]]) while the correct [[Old English]] form is ''mearh''.<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org Wiktionary], "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mearh mearh]"</ref>
