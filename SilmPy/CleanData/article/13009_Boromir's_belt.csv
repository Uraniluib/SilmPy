'''Boromir's belt''' was [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifted]] to '''[[Boromir]]''' by [[Galadriel]]. It appeared as it were of linked golden leaves.

==History==
Before the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] left [[Lothlórien]], each of its members was presented with a gift by [[Galadriel]]. Boromir was given a belt of gold which he carried in the journey until the Breaking of the Fellowship.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

When [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] laid him in his burial boat, the golden belt gleamed about his waist.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>

Later on, [[Faramir]] one night saw the boat by [[Anduin]] and Boromir lay there dead, and the belt was the only thing he did not recognize.  [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] said to Faramir that the belt was given to him in Lórien, and thus positively identified the dead man as Boromir.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>
