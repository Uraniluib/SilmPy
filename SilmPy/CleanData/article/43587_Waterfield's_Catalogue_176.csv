==From the catalogue==

:'''Signed by J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis & others'''<br>
'''191. RICE-OXLEY (Leonard)''' BRIANT (Keith) & WILKES (Lyall) ''Editors''. Would I Fight? [Essays by Oxford undergraduates and recent graduates]. ''Oxford: Basil Blackwell'', 1938. D.w. On the front free endpaper the pencilled statement (possibly in the hand of Dorothy Everett): 'Prize given for best reading at a meeting of the "Cave". The prize to be the worst book which could be found! Awarded to L. R-O. [Leonard Rice-Oxley]', followed by the pencilled signatures of 11 members of the Oxford English Faculty with J.R.R. Tolkien at the top and C.S. Lewis at the bottom. Lewis started by writing his name too far down, rubbed it out and has written it again a little further up and untidily - perhaps due to excess conviviality.
