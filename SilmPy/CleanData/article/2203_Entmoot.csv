'''Entmoot''' was the name for a meeting of the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]], said to be a rare occasion in the later days of the [[Third Age]]. The Moot was held by tradition at a dell in the Forest known as [[Derndingle]].<ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|III4}}</ref>
==[[War of the Ring]]==
During the War of the Ring, [[Hobbits]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] came to the [[Fangorn Forest]] and related to [[Treebeard]] of the Wizard [[Saruman|Saruman's]] treachery.

Treebeard then summoned an Entmoot which, due to the slow thinking and speech of the Ents, lasted for days, between [[30 February]] and [[2 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> 

The long, deliberate discussion led to the decision that -- facing an inevitable slow extinction -- they would attack [[Isengard]] to avenge the damage Saruman's [[Orcs]] had done to their tree-herds. This so-called '[[Ents#The_March_of_the_Ents|Last March of the Ents]]' was a significant event in the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Treebeard"/>
