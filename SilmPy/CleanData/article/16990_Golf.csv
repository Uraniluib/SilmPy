'''Golf''' was a game played by [[Hobbits]], similar to that of modern-day golf. According to Hobbit folklore, it was invented when [[Bandobras Took]] charged at [[Golfimbul]] during the [[Battle of Greenfields]] and knocked Golfimbul's head off. The head flew through the air for 100 yards and went down a rabbit hole.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>
