'''''Brandagamba''''' is the original [[Westron]] version of the [[Hobbits|hobbit-name]] translated into English as '''[[Brandybuck]]'''.

==Etymology==
It contains the element ''[[branda]]-'' 'borderland' (referring to [[Buckland]] being on the eastern edge of [[the Shire]]), but also evokes ''[[Branda-nîn]]'', 'border-water' (the early [[hobbitish]] name for the [[Brandywine]] river).<ref name="AppF">{{App|F2}}</ref>

The second half of the compound, ''-[[gamba]]'', is a re-occurrence from the older name ''[[Zaragamba]]'', or [[Oldbuck]] in the sense of a male deer or ram.

The river Branda-nîn was later jokingly altered to ''[[Bralda-hîm]]'', 'heady ale'. According to Tolkien, "only a very bold hobbit would have ventured to call the [[Master of Buckland]] ''braldagamba'' in his hearing". <ref name="AppF" />
===Note on translation===
While "[[Marchbuck Family|Marchbuck]]" would be a literal translation of the name, it would lose the traditional connection with Brandywine, apparent in the actual Brandagamba-Branda-nîn. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] rather translated the name as "[[Brandybuck|'''Brandy'''buck]]" in order to retain this connection.<ref name="AppF" />
