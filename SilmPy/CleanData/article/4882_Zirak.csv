'''''zirak''''' is a [[Khuzdul]] word, appearing in ''[[Celebdil#Etymology|Zirakzigil]]'' ("tine of silver").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 35</ref>

The word also appears as a short form of ''Zirakzigil'', the [[Dwarves]]' name for the mountain called ''[[Celebdil]]'' or ''Silvertine'' by other races.  [[Gimli]] referred to the [[Mountains of Moria]] as [[Baraz]], Zirak, and [[Shath√ªr]] when he first saw them.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

As ''[[zigil]]'' apparently means "silver", ''Zirak'' presumably means "tine" in [[Khuzdul]].
