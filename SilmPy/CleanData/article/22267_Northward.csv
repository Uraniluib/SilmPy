==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The wind is cold and heavy 
And storms are in the sky 
Our path across the nordland 
Goes higher and more high 

To left the sea we came from 
To right the white hills with no tree 
The wind is growing colder 
And shivering are we 

We drag with stiffening fingers 
Our swords and up the hill 
The path is steep and tangled 
But leads to battles still 

Dor firn i guinar. 


Farewell now mountain vale and plain 
Farewell now wind and frost and rain 
And mist and cloud and heavens air 
Ye star and moon so blinding fair 

Farewell now blade and bloom and grass 
That see the changing season pass 
Farewell sweet earth and northern sky 
Forever blessed but here we die 

Dor firn i guinar.
