'''Annael''' was a [[Sindar|Sinda]] in the [[First Age]]. 

Annael fought in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], and became the foster-father of [[Tuor]] during his early years in [[Mithrim]].  In order to seek refuge from the [[Easterlings]], Annael lead a small group to the caves of [[Androth]]. When Tuor was sixteen years of age, Annael resolved to lead his band to the south.  However, when they made the attempt a great force of [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] scattered Annael's people.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>  Later, he escaped [[Dor-lómin]] and joined [[Círdan]], far south in [[Beleriand]].
