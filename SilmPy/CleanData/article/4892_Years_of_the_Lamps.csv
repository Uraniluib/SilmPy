{{History of Arda}}
The '''Years of the Lamps''' began shortly after the creation of Arda by the [[Valar]]. After they entered the world, Arda was still lifeless and had no distinct geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by [[Two Lamps|two lamps]]: one in the continent's north, and one in the south, made out of the misty light that veiled the barren ground. The Valar concentrated this light into two large lamps, [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]].  The Vala [[Aulë]] forged great towers, one in the north, [[Helcar]], and another in the south, [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]]. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of [[Almaren]].
 
The lamps were destroyed by an assault by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. Arda was again darkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the perfect symmetry of Arda's surface. Separate continents were created: [[Aman]] in the far West, [[Middle-earth]] in the middle, the [[Uttermost East|Land of the Sun]] in the far East, and the [[Dark Land]] in the far South. At the site of the northern lamp was later the inland [[Sea of Helcar]], of which [[Cuiviénen]] was a bay. The [[Years of the Trees]] begin after that.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In Tolkien's latest writings in which Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Sun and Moon (and the [[Two Trees]] for a time) had always given light to Arda, and the Two Lamps never existed.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}, p. 375 - 385</ref>
