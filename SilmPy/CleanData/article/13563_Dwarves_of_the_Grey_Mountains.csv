The '''Dwarves of the Grey Mountains''' were the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]] who lived in the [[Grey Mountains]] in northern [[Middle-earth]]. 

==The Earliest Settlements==
In the [[First Age]], the Longbeards established mansions in [[Moria]] and the [[Iron Hills]], and they considered the Grey Mountains, which lay between these mansions, to be within their territory. Some [[Men]]—mostly related to the [[House of Hador]] of [[Beleriand]]—settled between the Grey Mountains and [[Greenwood]], and they allied with the Longbeards against Morgoth's [[Orcs]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>  This alliance ended in the Second Age after [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]], which prompted the Longbeards to seal Moria. During this time, Orcs took control of the Grey Mountains.<ref name=relations/>

==The Awakening of Durin's Bane==
Durin's folk started to gather in the Grey Mountains in {{TA|1981}} after a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] was awakened in their ancestral home of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which its people fled in fear. Another portion of Durin's folk lead by King [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|1999}}<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. 

Around {{TA|2000}}<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Scatha"</ref>, many centuries before Durin's Folk established a kingdom in the Ered Mithrin, [[Scatha]], a mighty [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] of the Grey Mountains and one of the greatest [[Dragons]] to infest that range of the north,  had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. He was slain by [[Fram]] son of [[Frumgar]] in the early days of the [[Éothéod]]. His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the [[Éothéod|Men of the Éothéod]] and the [[Dwarves]] of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." It was rumoured that for this insult the Dwarves killed him.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 

==The Seat of Durin's Realm==
In {{TA|2210}} King [[Thorin I]], learning that most of his people were gathering in the Grey Mountains, left the Lonely Mountain to join the Dwarves to the north, for those mountains were rich and little explored.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==The War of the Dwarves and Dragons==
For many years, Durin's folk prospered in the Ered Mithrin but, the dragons of the [[Forodwaith]] eventually multiplied and became strong, and in {{TA|2570}}<ref name="AppB">{{App|B2}}</ref> the Dragons made war on the dwarves, sacking and plundering their halls. The Dwarves held out for around twenty years, but finally in {{TA|2589|n}}<ref name="AppB"/> the Dragons attacked the halls of King [[Dáin I]]. King Dáin, and his second son [[Frór]], were killed by a [[Cold-drake]] outside his door to his halls.<ref name="Durin"/>

Following the death of their king, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the Grey Mountains. In {{TA|2590|n}},<ref name="AppB"/> King [[Thrór]] and his uncle [[Borin]] returned to the Erebor with the [[Arkenstone]] to re-establish the Kingdom under the Mountain. However, Thrór's younger brother [[Grór]] led others to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Later History==
There still was a remnant of the Dwarves in the Ered Mithrin after the core of the population left<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>, but were probably few; working whatever mines they could hold from the Orcs and Dragons.

It is likely that the Dwarves reclaimed all their old halls and mines sometime during the [[Fourth Age]], if not after [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] became king of Durin's folk in the late Third Age.
