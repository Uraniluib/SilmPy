==Excerpt==

{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Broberg,<br/><br/>I much regret that I shall not be in Oxford on the date that you suggest. I shall be away from the 19th June until the 15th July. I shall be in Bournemouth from July 4th. That is easily accessible from London and if the journey is worth the trouble to you merely for the purpose of seeing me I should be glad to give you a short interview. My address will be:<br/><br/> Hotel Miramar<br/>East Overcliff Drive<br/>Bournemouth, Hampshire<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien.}}
