he found the slayers and his foe. . .<br>

'''Rivil's Well''' was the spring of the river [[Rivil]], flowing from [[Dorthonion]] above the [[Fens of Serech]].  

It was here where an [[Orc]]-band, after [[Massacre at Tarn Aeluin|killing]] [[Barahir's Outlaw Band]], camped. Their captain boasted about his deeds, holding the severed hand of [[Barahir]], still with [[Ring of Barahir|his Ring]] on it. [[Beren]], having followed their traces, avenged his father by slaying the captain, while recapturing his father's hand. He fled leaving the Orcs aimless and dismayed.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>
