The '''Long Marshes''' were a region of marshes and pools dotted with isles that flanked both sides of the [[Forest River]].  They extended from the eastern edge of [[Mirkwood]] nearly to the shores of the [[Long Lake]].<ref name="welcome">{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

By {{TA|2941}} there had been great floods, rains, and a couple of earthquakes, causing the marshes and bogs to spread widely of either side of the river, erasing the paths (along with many riders and wanderers). The Forest River broke into hundreds of winding courses when it first encountered the Long Marshes, and still flowed strongly through the midst and offered the only safe way.<ref name="welcome"/>  

[[Gandalf]], who didn't know of the recent developments, when he left [[Thorin and Company]] at the [[Forest Gate]], told them to stick to the forest-track until they see the Long Marshes lying below them.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> But when Gandalf learned of the hazards that befell them, he was in great anxiety to finish his other business in [[Dol Guldur]] and to find Thorin.<ref name="welcome"/>
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In plot notes that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made while writing the story, the raftsmen told tales of disappearing rafts, men, and beasts;<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, p. 362</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests that the more ominous line in the notes may indicate that Tolkien had some unpleasantness in mind had [[Thorin and Company]] got into the marshes - perhaps meeting the [[Mewlips]].<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, (ii) ''Visiting the Mewlips'', p. 370</ref>
