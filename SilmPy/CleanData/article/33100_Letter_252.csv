==Summary==
Tolkien apologized for not answering Michael's letters sooner but [[C.S. Lewis|Jack Lewis']] death had preoccupied him.  People had written to him as one of Lewis' intimates but Tolkien said that that had ceased some ten years earlier.  [[Charles Williams]] and then Lewis' marriage had separated them, but they did owe each other a great debt.

Lewis had been great but the cold-blooded obituaries only scraped the surface.  That they contained little truth was shown by ascribing to Williams the main influence for Lewis' "space-travel" trilogy.  Actually Tolkien and Lewis had planned, before Williams ever appeared, to do "time-travel" and "space-travel" stories, respectively.  Publication dates were not good guides.  ''[[wikipedia:Perelandra|Perelandra]]'' was published in 1943 but was written earlier.  Williams only influenced the third book, ''[[wikipedia:That Hideous Strength|That Hideous Strength]]'', and Tolkien thought that his influence spoiled it.  The ''Daily Telegraph'' had reported that Lewis was not fond of ''[[wikipedia:The Screwtape Letters|The Screwtape Letters]]'' â€“ his best-seller (250,000).  Tolkien had wondered why Lewis had dedicated it to him; now he knew (according to the ''Daily Telegraph'').
