The river '''Hoarwell''', or '''Mitheithel''' was a river traversing eastern [[Eriador]].
==Course==
It began in the northern [[Misty Mountains]] west of the [[Rhimdath]] River and about 100 miles north of [[Rivendell]]. The Hoarwell flowed west past the [[Ettenmoors]] and then curved southward, skirting the western edge of the [[Trollshaws]]. Flowing under the [[Last Bridge]] on the [[East-West Road]], it coursed southward until it was joined by the [[Bruinen]] or "Loudwater". The Hoarwell turned south-west until at [[Tharbad]] it met with the [[Glanduin]], forming the fenland called ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' or "[[Swanfleet]]". Beyond this point the combined waters were called the [[Gwathló]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The Hoarwell was within the boundaries of [[Arnor]] when the realm was founded.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> In {{TA|861}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> when Arnor was dismembered, the river was within the confines of [[Rhudaur]].<ref name="Eriador"/>

Around {{TA|1150|n}} the [[Stoors]] came over the [[Redhorn Pass]] and settled in the [[Angle (Eriador)|Angle]], the land between the Hoarwell and the Loudwater. When [[Angmar]] became powerful about {{TA|1300|n}} these hobbits moved over the Hoarwell and settled near [[Bree]].<ref name="TA"/>

In May, {{TA|2941|n}}<ref name="TA"/> [[Thorin and Company]] crossed the Hoarwell on the Last Bridge (and later that night encountered the trolls).<ref name=Mutton/>

On [[11 October]] {{TA|3018|n}}, [[Glorfindel]] drove the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] from the Last Bridge<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref> and left a beryl on the roadway to show that the path was safe.<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref> Two days later, after finding the elf-stone, [[Aragorn]] led the hobbits across the bridge.<ref name="Great"/>

==Etymology==
''Hoar'' means "grey" and ''well'' in English placenames usually has the meaning of "spring, source".{{fact}}

The [[Sindarin]] name ''Mitheithel'' has the same meaning, "grey-spring" from ''[[mith]]'' "grey" and '[[eithel]]'' "spring".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the 1937 version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Hoarwell was described as a rushing ''red'' river coming from the mountains ''in front'' of the company. In the 1966 edition the adjective "red" was removed and the river came from the north in order to match the geography of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
