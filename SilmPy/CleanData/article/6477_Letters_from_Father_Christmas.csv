==From the Publisher==

{{blockquote|For more than twenty years, the children of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] received letters from the North Pole -- from [[Father Christmas]] himself! They told wonderful stories of mischief and disaster, adventures and battles: how the reindeer got loose and scattered presents all over the place, how the accident-prone Polar Bear climbed the North Pole and fell through the roof of Father Christmas's house, and many others.Now, for the first time, these letters are brought to life with specially arranged holiday music.}}

Kris Swank has discussed similarities between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the ''Letters from Father Christmas'', noting that they share a couple of story elements and that both works "contain story elements which have common roots in Tolkien's early [[The Book of Lost Tales (disambiguation)|Lost Tales]] and poems".<ref>Kris Swank, "[http://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-350791919/the-hobbit-and-the-father-christmas-letters ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Father Christmas Letters'']", in [[Mythlore 123|''Mythlore'' 123]]</ref>
