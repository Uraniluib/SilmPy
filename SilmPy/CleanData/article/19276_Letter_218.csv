==Summary==
A Mr. Eric Rogers had sent a letter to "any Professor of English Language". He inquired about the use of the verb in a passive sentence: Is it "A number of office walls ''has'' been damaged", or "''have'' been damaged"? 

Tolkien, now retired, stated Mr. Rogers could do as he liked; both are correct. Since "number"  is singular, the verb could be singular. But since "walls" is plural, the verb could be plural.
