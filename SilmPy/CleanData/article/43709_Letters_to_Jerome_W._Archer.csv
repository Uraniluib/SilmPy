==Excerpt==

{{Blockquote|Continuous over-work since 1951 has begun to tell on me; and I am feeling rather exhausted. I have recently been ill; and I am obliged to cancel plans travel this vacation. [...] Leave of absence will, however, I hope, enable me to clear off before next spring some of the things that are now harassing me; and I am now making preliminary plans for the use of the time, and am trying to fix some dates.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], Second letter to Jerome W. Archer (5 August 1957)}}
