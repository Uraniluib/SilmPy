'''Durin's Day''' is a rare event noted by [[Dwarves]].

The new year of their calendar was the last cycle of the [[Moon]] to begin in autumn, or in [[Thorin]]'s words "the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter"<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>. When on this day both the [[Sun]] and Moon may be seen in the sky together, it is called '''Durin's Day'''.

The [[Moon-letters]] written on the [[Thrór's Map]] predicted that on Durin's Day the last light of the Sun as night fell would reveal the [[Back Door|secret door]] into the [[Lonely Mountain]].
==Calculation==
Unlike ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] left no precise timetable for the events of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. However, in ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', Tolkien set [[19 October]] as the date of that year's [[Durin's Day]].<ref name="The History of The Hobbit">{{HH|T3}}, pp. 826,828</ref> 

Before the ''History'' some calculations were made. According to [[Andreas Möhn]], the Durin's Day of {{TA|2941}} occurred on [[22 October]] of the [[Shire Calendar]]. This is based in the assumption that the orbital period of the moon, as described in ''The Lord of the Rings'', was about 20 minutes shorter/faster than today.<ref>{{webcite|author=Andreas Möhn|articleurl=http://pages.citebite.com/b3g6a9v1lflq|articlename=The Moon and Durin's Day|dated=|website=lalaithmesp.blogspot.com|accessed=15-02-2018}}</ref>

[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] made a rough estimation based purely on the traveling times and distances, without any astronomical calculations. She puts the Durin's Day on [[30 October]].<ref>{{HM|AME}}, "The Hobbit", p. 100</ref>
