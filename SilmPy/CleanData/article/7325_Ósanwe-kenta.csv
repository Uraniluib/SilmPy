The '''''[[Ósanwe]]-[[centa|kenta]]''''', or "Enquiry into the Communication of Thought", is a manuscript by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It was  written in c. [[1959]]-[[1960|60]] as a typescript of eight pages and was published in {{VT|39}}. A related manuscript, "Etymological Notes on the ''Ósanwe-kenta''", was published in {{VT|41}}.

In the framework of the [[legendarium]] of [[Middle-earth]], the text is a summary by an unnamed editor of a longer treatise by [[Pengolodh]] of [[Gondolin]].

The subject-matter is '''''[[sanwe-latya]]''''' ([[Quenya]] for "thought-opening", but better translated as "telepathy"). Pengolodh included it as an appendix to the ''[[Lhammas]]'' because of the implications of ''[[tengwesta]]'' ("grammar, language") on thought-transmission, i.e. with the development of language, telepathy became more difficult and all but fell out of use among the "incarnated" (those beings with ''[[hröa]]'').
