The '''Men of the Vales of Anduin''' are peoples who lived to the north from [[Gondor]] and acknowledged its authority when the South-Kingdom reached the summit of its power in the days of king [[Hyarmendacil]] in the twelfth century T.A.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}.</ref>

It seems that the Men of the Vales of Anduin were ancestors of the [[Éothéod]], who moved to the regions near the sources of Anduin from the vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden]] during the reign of the king [[Eärnil II]] in the 21th century T.A.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}.</ref> At least they most probably descended from the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]] like most of the Men of the northern parts of the [[Westlands]].<ref>{{App|Men}}.</ref>

Their language had some influence on the language of the [[Hobbits]] who lived in the [[Vales of Anduin]] in that time.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}; {{App|Translation}}. The influence is detectable at least in the Hobbit personal names and in the names of the months of the [[Shire Calendar]].</ref>
