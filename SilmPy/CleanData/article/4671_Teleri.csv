The '''Teleri''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[ˈtɛlεri]}}) were the third of the [[Elves|Elf]] clans who took the [[Great Journey]]. To them belonged the [[Valinor]]ean Teleri (known as the [[Falmari]]), and the [[Sindar]], [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]], and [[Nandor]] of [[Middle-earth]].

At first they were known as '''[[Nelyar]]''' ("The Third"), and were the largest of the three houses of the Firstborn. According to legend, they were descended from [[Enel]], the third Elf to [[Awakening of the Elves|awake]] in [[Cuiviénen]], his spouse [[Enelyë]] and their seventy-two companions; most of the [[Avari]] originally belonged to this clan.

In ancient times they named themselves '''[[Teleri#Names|Lindar]]''', or "Singers", because they were known for their fair voice.

==History==
According to legend, the clan was founded by [[Enel]], the third Elf to awake at [[Cuiviénen]]. With him were his spouse [[Enelyë]] and their 72 companions, and this clan became known as the '''Nelyar'''.

=== During the Great Journey ===

When the [[Valar]] decided to bring the [[Quendi]] to [[Aman]], they chose three ambassadors. [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë]] travelled there and tried to convince their people to make the journey. Out of the original 74 Nelyar who awoke at Cuiviénen, 28 refused and became part of the [[Avari]], "The Unwilling".

The Teleri clan was so numerous that it was led both by Elwë and his brother [[Olwë]]. They were the last clan to depart, and the only ones who were unwilling to leave the wild lands of [[Middle-earth]] and were usually the hindmost of the [[Great Journey]]. In their earliest days they had begun the crafting of rafts and paddle-driven boats, and their ships became larger and stronger upon their need to traverse the [[Sea of Rhûn]] on their westward journey.<ref>{{PM|Last}} p. 391-392</ref> After travelling for many years, the Teleri stopped near river [[Anduin]] being frightened by the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]] ([[Misty Mountains]]). Then a group led by [[Lenwë]] departed from the journey and headed south. They were called the [[Nandor]] ("Those who turn back"). Eventually, the other Teleri passed the Misty Mountains and reached Eastern [[Beleriand]] near the river [[Gelion]].

That was the time when Elwë fell in love with [[Melian]] the [[Maiar|Maia]] and became separated from the Teleri, standing in the forest of [[Nan Elmoth]] for a long time only staring at her. Olwë became their leader, but some Teleri, especially Elwë's friends and close relatives were searching for him for a long time and refused to continue their journey without him. Those in [[Sindarin]] were known as the [[Eglath]] as they forsook the Great Journey.

Being the hindmost, the Teleri were still near [[Gelion]] and failed to hear [[Ulmo]]'s call when the Vanyar and the Noldor travelled into the West. When they learned that the others had already departed, they headed to the shores of Beleriand near the mouth of the river [[Sirion]] waiting for [[Ulmo]]. The Maia [[Ossë]] kept them company while they waited, and became their friend. When they first beheld the sea, the Teleri became enamoured with it, and ever after desired to live close to the shore, being named 'Sea-elves' in Aman. <ref>{{S|3}}</ref>

Later, when Ulmo arrived again with the island ferry, most of the Teleri agreed to travel. Again, there were some who wanted to stay with Ossë, and they became known as [[Falathrim]] in Sindarin, with [[Círdan|Nowë]] as their leader.

Out of the 46 original Telerin Eldar who began the Great Journey, only 20 among them arrived in Aman with their offspring, whereas the other 26 firstborn remained in Middle-earth as Sindar or Nandor.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}} p. 381</ref>

=== After the Great Journey ===

The island was stabilized by Ulmo near the [[Bay of Eldamar]], and it was named [[Tol Eressëa]], ''The Lonely Island''. The Teleri lived there for many years until they felt that they should see the other [[Eldar]] who lived in Aman proper. With the help of Ossë they built ships and travelled to the coasts of Aman, where they dwelt. There Olwë built [[Alqualondë]], the greatest city of Teleri, and its people were united with the people of [[Tirion]] and [[Finwë]].

In Beleriand, Elwë and Melian recovered from their enchantment. He united the Eglath who stayed back, and the Falathrim who accepted him as King of Beleriand. The folk of both Elwë and Nowë became collectively known as the [[Sindar]]. Later they were joined by the [[Laiquendi|Laegil]], the Nandor who resumed their journey to the west under [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] and came to [[Ossiriand]].

Later, when [[Morgoth|Melkor]] stole the [[Silmarils]], the [[Noldor]] led by [[Fëanor]] demanded that the Teleri let them use their ships. When the Teleri refused, they took the ships by force, committing the [[First Kinslaying]]. For this reason few or none of the Teleri joined the host of the [[Valar]] which at the end of the [[First Age]] set out to capture [[Morgoth]] for good. It is recounted that the Teleri eventually forgave the Noldor for the Kinslayings, and the two kindreds were at peace again.

==Sundering of Teleri==
*'''[[Falmari]]'''. Led by [[Olwë]], they (along with [[Elwë]]) were the only [[Calaquendi]] of the Teleri clan. They lived in Tol Eressëa and along the east shores of Aman.

*'''[[Nandor]]''' Teleri who abandoned the Great Journey near river Anduin, led by [[Lenwë]].
**'''[[Laiquendi]]''' The Elves of [[Ossiriand]], who were themselves Nandor led by [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]].

*'''[[Sindar]]''' All Teleri who remained in Beleriand. The Sindar of [[Beleriand]] called themselves simply ''[[Sindar|Edhil]]'', which means ''Elves'', and is related to the Quenya word ''Eldar'' of the same meaning.  Elwë was their King. These were further divided into:
**'''[[Iathrim]]'''<ref name="Q&E-B-S-3">{{WJ|B}}, 3</ref>, those who lived in [[Doriath]], the realm directly ruled by King [[Thingol]], that is Elwë.
**'''[[Falathrim]]''', those who lived in the [[Falas]] ruled by [[Círdan]].
**'''[[Elves of Mithrim|Mithrim]]'''<ref name="Q&E-B-S-3"/>, or Sindar of the North, those who lived in Northern Beleriand: in [[Hithlum]], especially in the area called after them [[Mithrim]], in [[Dorthonion]] or in [[Nevrast]]. They suffered most from Morgoth's attacks before the first rising of the Sun, and their remnants were largely absorbed by the Noldor who afterwards occupied those lands.

==Language==
The Teleri spoke the [[Common Telerin]] language during the Journey, from which [[Sindarin]] (with its dialects of [[Doriathrin]], [[Falathrin]] and [[North Sindarin]]) and [[Nandorin]] were derived, as well as the [[Telerin]] of Aman, often considered a dialect of [[Quenya]] (if only by virtue that it preserved more of the archaic Common Eldarin features than any other language and remained mutually intelligible with Quenya). 

==Etymology==
''Teleri'' is the plural of ''Teler'' which means "last", root [[TEL]]. 

In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' the word Teleri refers both to the Third Clan in general, and that branch that made it to Aman, taken from the Vanyar and Noldor point of view; particularly the Teleri of Aman were called [[Falmari]]. 

==Names==

Equivalent names of the Teleri were '''''[[Nelyar]]''''' and '''''Lindar'''''. ''Lindar'' ([[Quenya]] "singers", pron. {{IPA|[ˈlindar]}}) was the name by which the [[Teleri]] called themselves.

Another name was [[Sindarin]] '''''Glinnil''''' (sing ''Glinnel''), a name which appears to have been used only by the loremasters among the Eldar.<ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 378, 385</ref>

'''Sea-elves''' was yet another name of the Teleri, specifically those of that kin who came to [[Aman]] and dwelt at [[Alqualondë]] (the [[Falmari]]), for their love of the sea and reverence of [[Ulmo]]. The name "Sea-elves" was rendered ''Veaneldar'' in Quenya,<ref>{{LR|A1}}, p. 403</ref> consisting of ''vea(n)'' ("sea") + ''[[eldar]]'' ("elves").<ref>{{VT|36a}}, p. 20</ref>

The Teleri were also known by many other names: the Foam-riders, the Singers of the Shore, the Free, the Swift, the Arrow-elves (for their love of bow and arrow), the Elves of the Sea, the Ship-wrights, the Swanherds, the Gatherers of Pearl, the Blue Elves, and the people of Olwë.<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 164</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the early versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''), they were known as '''''Solosimpi''''' ("Pipers of the Shores"), while the name ''Teleri'' was given to the clan of Elves known in the published version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as [[Vanyar]].
