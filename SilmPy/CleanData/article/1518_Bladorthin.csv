{{quote|... the spears that were made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for...|<ref name=Inside>{{H|Inside}}</ref>}}
'''Bladorthin''' was a king of some realm of [[Middle-earth]] during the mid-[[Third Age]].

Questions about whether Bladorthin was a [[Men|Man]] or an [[Elves|Elf]], or precisely where his kingdom lay, must remain in the realm of speculation.
==History==
Bladorthin ruled a great kingdom which maintained armies and had trade relationships with [[Erebor]]. His rule could be placed anytime between {{TA|1999}} and {{TA|2770}}.

He had ordered thrice-forged spears of superior quality for his soldiers from the [[Dwarves of Erebor]]. The smiths forged them, but for some reason Bladorthin never received his weapons and the spears remained in their halls.<ref name=Inside/>

It is possible that the [[Sack of Erebor|descent]] of [[Smaug]] on the [[Lonely Mountain]] was what prevented the trade, in which case his death can be put after that event. 

On the other hand his death was perhaps premature and it was the reason that the trade was never completed.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Bladorthin"</ref>

In any case, he died long before {{TA|2941}}.<ref name=Inside/>
==Etymology==
[[John D. Rateliff]] has noted that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never explained the meaning of the name ''Bladorthin''. He identifies the name as "clearly [[Gnomish]] (or perhaps [[Noldorin]])".

The Gnomish element ''blador'' "probably applies to wide open country" (cf. [[Bladorinand]], an early name of [[Beleriand]]), whereas the element ''-thin'' likely has the meaning of "grey" (as in ''[[Thingol#Etymology|'''Thin'''gol]]''). This would give the translation "the Grey Country", "Grey Plains Fay", or "Grey Master of the Plains".<ref name=HH>{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 52-3, 62-3</ref>

==Other Versions of the [[Legendarium]]==
In the early drafts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bladorthin was the name of [[Gandalf]] (who would later be assigned the colour "grey" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). A connection can still be seen with the element ''-thin'' with the probable meaning "grey" (see [[#Etymology|above]]).<ref name=HH/>

==Speculation==
*[[Robert Foster]] suggests Bladorthin was an Elven king and that his premature death prevented the trade. The speculation that his death was premature narrows down the time of his death between {{TA|1999}} (the establishment of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]]) and {{TA|2770}} (its destruction by [[Smaug]]).
*[[J.E.A. Tyler]] also interprets his death as premature
*[[Michael Martinez]] also interprets his death as premature, and suggests that he was a King of [[Dale]], perhaps ancestor of [[Girion]].<ref>[[Parma Endorion]]</ref>
*[[Douglas A. Anderson]] in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' suggests he was a [[Gift of Men|mortal]] Man.
*An article in the [[Tolkienwiki]] suggests not only that his death was premature but that his kingdom was destroyed by [[Sauron]], presumably located near the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref>[http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi?FAQ/Who__was__King__Bladorthin FAQ: Who was King Bladorthin?]</ref>
*[[Andreas Moehn]] counters most of the common theories, notably the interpretation that his death was premature. As the book does not mention his death as such, most probable is that Smaug's arrival in {{TA|2770}} prevented the trade. Therefore he must died sometime later. He also rejects the theory that his kingdom was related to Dale, and locates it in [[Dorwinion]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|The Hobbit]]'':'''
:Bladorthin's spears are some of the items [[Bilbo Baggins]] must find in Erebor for a quest in the chapter "Inside Information".
