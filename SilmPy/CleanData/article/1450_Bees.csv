'''Bees''' were buzzing domestic insects kept for their ability to make honey. Particularly famous were those of [[Beorn]], which reached an enormous size.<ref>{{H|7}}</ref>  The fine [[the Shire|Shire]] weather of summer and autumn in {{TA|3018}} was such that "honey was dripping in the combs".<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

In [[Qenya]], the word for "honey bee" is ''nier'' (''nies''-), and "a bee" is ''nion'' or ''nier''. The [[Gnomish]] word for "a bee" is ''nios'' or ''nio'' (''niwin'' is "a female bee", and ''niosturwin'' means "queen bee").<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 65</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 60</ref>
