'''''Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien's Mythology''''' is a scholarly book on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works, written by [[Verlyn Flieger]].
==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|In ''Interrupted Music'' Flieger attempts to illuminate the structure of Tolkien's work, allowing the reader to appreciate its broad, overarching design and its careful, painstaking construction. In addition, Flieger reviews attempts at myth-making in the history of English literature by Spenser, Milton, and Blake as well as by Joyce and Yeats. She reflects on the important differences between Tolkien and his predecessors and even more between Tolkien and his contemporaries.}}
