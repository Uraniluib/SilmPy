'''Badger-brock''' was an individual of the [[Badger-folk]], mentioned only in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse. He had a "''snowy forehead''" and "''dark blinking eyes''", and lived with his wife and many sons in a secret house near the [[Withywindle]]. On one occasion, Badger-brock caught and pulled down [[Tom Bombadil]] to the burrows of the Badger-folk under earth. But Tom displayed his power using chant, which caused all the Badger-folk to become frightened, and they showed him out again.<ref name=AB>{{AB|1}}</ref>
