==Summary==
Tolkien was not relishing the re-editing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  It was difficult if not impossible to find more than a small number of necessary or desirable changes.  His admiration had grown for the poor author (who now seemed a remote friend) and the tightness of his construction.  He hoped that changing the introductions, considerably modifying the appendices, and including an index would be sufficient for the purpose.

Tolkien mentioned<ref group="note">Again, as he had in [[Letter 270]].</ref> that in every response to "fan" letters from the U.S. he informed the writers that [[Ace Books]] has published without consent and no remuneration to him or his rightful publisher.  He asked Unwin if this were done on a larger scale would it be useful.
