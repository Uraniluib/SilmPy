The '''Exile of the Noldor''', also known as the '''Flight of the Noldor''', refers to the historical period when many of the [[Noldor]], seeking revenge, departed from [[Valinor]] to [[Middle-earth]].

== History ==
After the [[Darkening of Valinor]], [[Fëanor]] rebelled against the [[Valar]], and set out from [[Aman]] with most of his fellow [[Noldor]]. His aim was to make war on [[Morgoth|Melkor]] for the recovery of the stolen [[Silmarils]], and his hatred and pride were so great that he swore an [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]] that bound himself and his sons to destroy any who held them from their goal. 

From this Oath stemmed the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]], and aboard the stolen ships of the [[Teleri]] Fëanor and his sons set out to gain their vengeance in [[Middle-earth]]. Left behind by Fëanor, [[Fingolfin]] and his people had to make their way into [[Middle-earth]] across the treacherous wastes of the [[Helcaraxë]]. The Valar allowed them to depart, but closed their land against any return, making them exiles from Aman. After long ages, the exile was relaxed, and the Noldor were allowed to return to the [[Blessed Realm]]. Among the last of these was [[Galadriel]], who had been part of the ancient rebellion, but was forgiven at last because of her actions in the [[War of the Ring]].

==Names==
The Noldor who left Aman called themselves the ''Etyañgoldi'' ("Exiled Ñoldor") in [[Quenya]], or simply the "Noldor" because few of their clan chose to remain in Aman. Although the exiled Noldor claimed that they were ''[[Amanyar]]'' ("Those of Aman"), in practice the term ''Amanyar'' came to refer to only those Elves who remained in Aman.<ref>{{WJ|B}}, pp. 374-375</ref> But unlike all other Elves of Middle-earth (except [[Thingol]]), the Exiles were counted among the ''[[Kalaquendi]]'' ("Light-elves") because they had experienced the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]].<ref>{{WJ|B}}, p. 373</ref>
