==Summary==
Robert H. Boyer had written to Tolkien asking him about his relation with [[W.H. Auden]]. Tolkien replied that they did not know each other that long, and most of their communication went by mail. They had only met in person a few times, though Auden had attended several of Tolkien's lectures on [[Old English]]. 

Tolkien did thank Auden for being an encouragement in his writing endeavour, and regarded him as one of his better friends. He also contributed a [[For W.H.A.|poem]] to the [[Shenandoah: A Tribute to Wystan Hugh Auden on his Sixtieth Birthday|festschirft in tribute of Auden's 60th birthday]].
