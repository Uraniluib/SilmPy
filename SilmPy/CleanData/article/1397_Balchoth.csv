The '''Balchoth''' were a clan of [[Easterlings]] under the sway of [[Dol Guldur]], who lived in  [[Rhovanion]], the lands southeast of the forest of [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=A1ivS>{{App|A1ivS}}</ref> They were no doubt related to the [[Wainriders]].<ref name=CE/>

They had crude weapons and few horses, used mostly for drawing their large wains.<ref name=CE/>
==History==
In {{TA|2510|n}} of the [[Third Age]], they attempted, with the assistance of [[Orcs]], an invasion of [[Calenardhon]], a minimally populated northern province of [[Gondor]]. After pushing back the northern Gondorian army, they were repulsed by [[Eorl]], who arrived with the [[Éothéod]], after receiving the plea of [[Cirion]] late. The Balchoth were no match for the horsemen of the Éothéod, and during the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], they were hunted down and utterly destroyed.<ref name=A1ivS/><ref name=CE>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The compound ''Balchoth'' consists of [[Westron]] ''[[balc]]'' ("horrible") + [[Sindarin]] ''[[hoth]]'' ("horde"). It was actually a generic term for disliked peoples, including the [[Orcs]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}} (Note 24)</ref>
