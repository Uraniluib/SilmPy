__NOTOC__
The '''Black Speech''' was created by [[Sauron]] during the [[Dark Years]] to be the sole language of all the servants of Mordor, replacing the many different varieties of [[Orkish]] and other languages used by his servants. When Sauron was overthrown at the end of the [[Second Age]] the ancient "pure" form was forgotten by all but the [[Nazgûl]].  When Sauron returned it was once again made the official language of [[Barad-dûr]].  However, a more "debased" form was used by the soldiery of [[Barad-dûr]] at the end of the [[Third Age]].<ref name="Trans">{{App|Translation}}</ref> The only example given of "pure" Black Speech is the inscription upon [[the One Ring]]<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>:

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
</poem>

When translated into English, these words form the lines:

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
</poem>

These are the first two lines from the end of a [[Ring Verse|verse]] about the [[Rings of Power]].

Many Orkish dialects had adopted words from it.<ref name="Trans"/> The Black Speech was at least in part based on [[Valarin]].

==Inspiration==
In real life, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created this language with the intention of making it harsh and ugly.{{fact}} The Black Speech is one of the more incomplete languages in Tolkien's novels, because the forces of good refuse to utter it. 

Tolkien linguist [[Helge Fauskanger]] has noted a theory proposed by Russian historian Alexander Nemirovski, that the Black Speech, according to the shape of words, agglutination and grammar, shares many similarities with the ancient Mesopotamian language [[Wikipedia:Hurrian language|Hurrian]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/orkish.htm|articlename=Orkish and the Black Speech - base language for base purposes|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=12 January 2013}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
: Linguist [[David Salo]] used what little is known of the Black Speech to create enough of a language for use in the films.<ref>[http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_archives_4.htm Language in The Lord of the Rings Movie (August 12, 2003)] at [http://www.elvish.org/ Elvish.org] (accessed 26 December 2010)</ref> This is usually referred to by [[Tolkienists]] as neo-Black Speech.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
: In the 2013 film, "The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug", Gandalf showed a promissory note to Thorin. The note that promised payment for Thorin's head was written in "black speech".
