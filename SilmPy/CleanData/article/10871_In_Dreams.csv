'''In Dreams''' is a song sung in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]] during the track ''[[The Breaking Of The Fellowship (soundtrack)|The Breaking Of The Fellowship]]'' composed by [[Howard Shore]] and [[Fran Walsh]], and sung by [[Edward Ross]].  The tune bears a remarkable resemblance to the traditional hymn "''[http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/t/i/tismyfw.htm This is my Father's world]''", and the opening musical phrase is identical.  The tune is often played as a "[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]" or "[[the Shire|Shire]]" theme throughout the film.

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
When the cold of Winter comes
Starless nights will cover day
In the veiling of the sun
We will walk in bitter rain

But in dreams
I can hear your name
And in dreams
We will meet again

When the seas and mountains fall
And we come, to end of days
In the dark I hear a call
Calling me there
I will go there
And back again
</poem>
