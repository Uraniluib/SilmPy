'''Glithui''' was a small river that rose beneath [[Amon Darthir]] in the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]], beneath a steep and treacherous pass out of [[Dor-lómin]] into [[West Beleriand]]. It flowed southward away from the mountains for less than fifty miles, after which its waters ran into the [[Teiglin]] (north of that river's confluence with the [[Malduin]]), and on into the mighty river [[Sirion]].<ref>{{CH|Map}}</ref>

[[Voronwë]] led [[Tuor]] across the Glithui as they journeyed east along the Ered Wethrin towards [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>  Later, when [[Túrin]] escaped from [[Dor-lómin]] he used the pass that came down to the Glithui.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Turin''</ref>

The Glithui is shown on the map that accompanies ''[[The Silmarillion]]'',<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> but is not labelled there.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, note 16</ref>
