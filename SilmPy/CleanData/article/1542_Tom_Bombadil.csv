'''Tom Bombadil''' was an enigmatic figure that lived throughout the history of [[Arda]]. Living in the depths of the [[Old Forest]], he seemed to possess unequaled power in the land around his dwelling. Although seemingly benevolent, he took no stance against the [[Dark Lord]]s.

His existence passed into Hobbit lore and was referenced in poems such as ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. 

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Olanda Fong-Surdenas - Tom Bombadil.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Tom Bombadil'' by Olanda Fong-Surdenas]]
{{quote|He is a strange creature.|[[Elrond]], ''[[The Council of Elrond]]''}}
The origins and [[Tom Bombadil/Nature|nature of Tom Bombadil]] are unknown; however, he already existed when the [[Morgoth|Dark Lord]] came to [[Arda]],<ref name="house">{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref> signifying he was alive even before the coming of the [[Valar]].

His role and nature in the [[Elder Days]] is unknown, but he must have witnessed most of the major events and battles. He also witnessed the reducing of the great forests that covered all [[Middle-earth]], and perhaps of his powers.<ref name="CoE"/> 

The level of his interactions with the outside world is also unclear; however, he seemed to have a name among many peoples and perhaps became a folkloric figure in the traditions and legends of Elves, Dwarves and Men.<ref name="CoE"/><ref name="Adv">{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

During the [[Third Age]], Tom Bombadil lived in a little house by the river [[Withywindle]] in the [[Old Forest]], together with his lovely wife [[Goldberry]]. He had contact with the [[Bucklanders]]<ref name="Adv"/> and [[Farmer Maggot]], and perhaps it was this to which he owed his jolly and whimsical attitude.

However, since he was merry and benevolent, some of the Free Peoples considered him a potential ally (for example, [[Elrond]] and [[Erestor]] considered that he should be present at the [[Council of Elrond]]). However, according to [[Gandalf]], Tom Bombadil was perhaps not fully aware of the struggle of Light and Darkness and could not prove useful to their causes.<ref name="CoE"/>

===War of the Ring===
[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The Willow Man is Tamed.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Willow Man is Tamed'']]
On [[26 September]], {{TA|3018}}, he encountered [[travellers|four hobbits]] while he was searching for water-lilies for his wife. Two of those Hobbits, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], had been captured by [[Old Man Willow]]. Tom, who was the master of the Old Forest, rescued them, and took all four of them to his house.<ref name="OldF">{{FR|Forest}}</ref>

The four hobbits stayed two nights, and he told them many tales and songs. With cunning questions, he made [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] tell him of the [[The One Ring|Ring]]. When Tom tried it on, nothing happened, but he then took it off and flipped it in the air and made the ring itself disappear, showing that indeed within his realm Tom was master. However, when Frodo put the ring on, Tom could still see him. He bade the Hobbit to come back and sit down; his hand was fairer without the ring.

The following morning, Tom warned his guests of the [[Barrow-downs]], and advised them to pass any barrow on the western side. He also taught them a song, should they come to peril.<ref name="house"/>

And they did come to peril. Tom chased off a [[Barrow-wights|wight]] with song, and broke the spells on the barrow in which the four hobbits were captured. While he sent the Hobbits into calm down, he went for provisions. He also brought the ponies that had belonged to Merry. After that, he broke the spells of the barrow. From the barrow's mighty hoard, he took a brooch for Goldberry, and gave a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] to each of the hobbits. He then advised them to make for ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' in [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}</ref>

The peril of the hobbits was not over; an attack on their lives was carried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently remembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Bombadil, and returned to stay beside Tom's own pony, [[Fatty Lumpkin]]. He returned them to [[Barliman Butterbur]], the proprietor of ''The Prancing Pony''. Since he had paid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner of five fine ponies.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

==Etymology and other names==
Tom Bombadil went by many names: 
* To the [[Elves]] and [[Dúnedain]], he was known as '''''[[iaur|Iar]][[gwain|wain]] [[penadar|Ben-adar]]''''', which translates to "oldest and fatherless".<ref name="CoE">{{FR|Council}}</ref> Iarwain literally means "Old-young"<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' p. 128; quoting an unpublished letter by Tolkien</ref>
* To [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]] and [[Rohan]], he was known as '''''Orald'''''.<ref name="CoE"/> This is an [[Old English]] word meaning  "very ancient.<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, p, 761</ref>
* The Dwarves knew him as '''''Forn'''''. This too is a reference to his age: it is [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]] for "(belonging to) ancient (days)".<ref name="nomen"/> In some imprints of ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index]]'', this name was accidentally spelled with a "P" as the first letter.<ref>{{HM|IX}}, "Tom Bombadil (VII)", p. 435</ref>
* ''Tom Bombadil'' is said to be a [[Buckland|Bucklandish]] name, added by Hobbit chroniclers to his many older ones. It is, like many names of the Bucklanders, untranslatable.<ref name="Adv"/>

==Inspiration==

Tom Bombadil was inspired primarily from a doll Tolkien's son, Michael, toyed with.{{fact}}

[[Paula Marmor]] notes that ''bobadil'' is an archaic word meaning "braggart", as seen in the character "Captain Bobadill" in the English play ''[[Wikipedia:Every Man in His Humour|Every Man in His Humour]]''. Because of its Bucklandish form, ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'' lists the name Bombadil under the "[[Celtic]]-sounding names". However, it is said that the word derives from '''[[Wikipedia:Boabdil|Boabdil]]''', the Spaniard name of [[Wikipedia:Muhammad XII of Granada|'''Abu Abdillah''' Muhammad XII]], the last Moorish ruler of Granada.<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', Giving of Names</ref>

[[John D. Rateliff]] has noted a theory launched by scholar Justin Noetzel. In the latter's paper "Beorn and Tom Bombadil: Mythology, Narrative, and The Most (Non) Essential Characters in Middle-earth", Noetzel suggests an association of Tom Bombadil with the [[Wikipedia:Celtic Otherworld|Celtic Otherworld]] and tales of the [[Wikipedia:Tuatha Dé Danann|Tuatha Dé Danann]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[John D. Rateliff]]|articleurl=http://sacnoths.blogspot.se/2013/03/valparaiso-day-three.html|articlename=Valparaiso, Day Three|dated=12 March 2013|website=Sac|accessed=14 March 2013}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

Because he is left out of the three major adaptations ([[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|Ralph Bakshi]], [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC's 1981 series]] and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Peter Jackson's]]), Tom Bombadil's main role (providing the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blades]]) is omitted. He does have several appearances in other adaptations, though.

'''1955: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)|BBC Radio's The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:[[Norman Shelley]] voiced Bombadil, and Tolkien thought his portrayal "dreadful". [[Goldberry]] was portrayed as his daughter, rather than his wife<ref>{{L|175}}</ref>. 

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:In this series, Tom was voiced by [[Bernard Mayes]]. Like Norman Shelley before him, he also voiced [[Gandalf]].

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Tom Bombadil can be found outside his house in the Old Forest.

'''1990: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings Volume I]]'':'''
:Tom Bombadil rescues the party from the Willow Man, and provides information, supplies, shelter, and side-quests for the party.  He later rescues the party from the Barrow Wights, and very briefly joins as a temporary playable character while inside the barrow.  His role runs almost directly parallel to the original, with some related passages of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' quoted directly.  However, [[Goldberry]]'s role is significantly changed to provide a quest for the party.

'''1992: [[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]]:'''
:When he adapted the 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio series]], [[Brian Sibley]] deeply regretted cutting Bombadil from the radio series.<ref>[[Brian Sibley]], ''[http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html The Ring Goes Ever On]''</ref> When he made ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'' into a radio series, he decided to change the section "[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]". Rather than several (unadaptable) Hobbitish poems, Sibley adapted the chapters from ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. Bombadil is voiced by [[Ian Hogg]].

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:Although Tom Bombadil does not appear in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card for the character. He was portrayed by Harry Weller-Chew.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:[[Daran Norris]] portrayed Bombadil with a Scottish accent. His role is much like that in the book, and as one of the few characters in this video game, he keeps most of his songs. 

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|extended edition]], some of Bombadil's poems are transferred to [[Treebeard]], and so is his encounter with [[Old Man Willow]].

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Bombadil is a summonable power. Once summoned, he can plow through enemy lines. His most powerful weapon is a "Sonic Song". As soon as [[Electronic Arts|EA]] secured the rights to the books, it was decided that Tom Bombadil should be in it; his appearance is kept close to his description in the book.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battleformiddleearth2/news.html?sid=6139678 The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle-earth II Q&A - Enter Tom Bombadil], [http://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot.com]</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Tom can be found either inside or outside his house in the Old Forest. He helps the player track down crebain scouts possessing important information, and later arrives to rescue the player from the Barrow-Downs when (s)he gets himself in more than (s)he is prepared for, much like the Hobbits in the Book.

'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''
:Bombadil is a playable character.  He uses a trowel as a weapon and for digging in certain spots. Tom can be found in his house on the road to the north of [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the forested area between [[Bree]] and the Shire. It is unclear if this forest is meant to be the Old Forest or not; it is in the right location, but the game never specifically names it and its physical appearance does not fit the book's description.

===Collectibles===
In [[April]] [[2008]], [[Gentle Giant]] released the Tom Bombadil Mini Bust.
