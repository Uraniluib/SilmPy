==Summary==
[[Naomi Mitchison]] had a number of questions about the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Tolkien began the letter by thanking her for all her letters and appologized for not answering them. He stated that some of the questions were answered in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', but since the publisher won't publish the book he needed to write an appendix to the third volume to address some of the issues.

Tolkien explained that [[Westron]] was the Common Speech of the [[Third Age]] of [[Middle-earth]] and these words had been translated into English. Forms of speech related to Westron he had turned into forms of speech related to English. He stated that for the [[Rohirric|language]] of the [[Rohirrim]] he used a modified version of [[Old English]], while the [[language of Dale|language]] of [[Dale]] and [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] was a modified [[Scandinavian]].

Furthermore, Tolkien described the Elven languages of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'': [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]. Quenya was grammatically inspired from Latin, Finnish and Greek. Sindarin had a linguistic character similar to British-Welsh. 

Tolkien also explained that the [[Quendi]] were similar in appearance to Men with greatly enhanced aesthetic and creative faculties, greater beauty and longer life. There were two types of Quendi: the [[Eldar]] who heard the summons to take the [[Great Journey]] and the Lesser Elves who did not answer. The Eldar themselves branched off into two different types: the [[Noldor]] or High Elves and the [[Sindar]] or Grey-elves. The Noldor at the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were Exiles.

In that letter, Tolkien also briefly discusses his 'fear' that the [[Entwives]] may in fact have been destroyed by [[Sauron]].
