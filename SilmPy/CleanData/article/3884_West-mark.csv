The '''West-mark''' was the military division of [[Rohan]] that lay to the west of the [[Entwash]] and [[Snowbourn]] rivers (excepting the lands around the capital at [[Edoras]]), commanded by a [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|Marshal]] based at [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref> Bordering on Rohan's enemies in [[Dunland]], the West-mark was historically the scene of much strife. The worst troubles in this region were seen during the [[Long Winter]], when the [[Dunlendings]] forced the [[Rohirrim]] to abandon [[Edoras]] and flee to the West-mark, where they sheltered in Helm's Deep.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

[[Isengard]] also lay on its borders, so that the West-mark was of great importance during the [[War of the Ring]]. The King's son [[Th√©odred]] was given the rank of Second Marshal of the Mark, and given the command of this region in the wars with [[Saruman]]. He went to battle with the enemy at the [[Fords of Isen]], where he lost his life. The command of the West-mark was then taken by the lord [[Erkenbrand]], who fought and lost a second battle at the Fords, but was able to rally enough of his forces to help in the desperate defence of Helm's Deep.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>
