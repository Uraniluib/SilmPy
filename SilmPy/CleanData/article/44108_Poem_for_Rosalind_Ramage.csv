The '''poem for Rosalind Ramage''' refers to a [[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|poem]] written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], published in 2018 in ''[[Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth]]''. The poem was "''written for an American girl named Rosalind Ramage who had written Tolkien a fan letter in October [[1964]]''". Tolkien submitted the poem, together with "[[The Dragon's Visit]]" and "[[Once upon a Time]]", for publication in ''[[Winter's Tales for Children 1]]''. Due to lack of space, only the two latter poems were included in the children's anthology.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Douglas A.
