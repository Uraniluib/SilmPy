'''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water''' is the title of an illustration by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref name=AI/>

==Description==

The illustration shows the road leading through [[Hobbiton]] to [[Bagshot Row]] and the [[Hobbiton Hill]]. Just below the Hill is seen [[the Party Tree]]. In the foreground is depicted [[the Water]] and the [[Old Mill]]. In the centre stands the [[Old Grange]]. In the distant, to the left of the Hill, one can glimpse what likely is the [[Bindbale Wood]] of the [[North Farthing]].<ref>{{HM|AoH}}, p. 31</ref><ref name=AI/>

==History==

Tolkien made several sketches — at least five — before creating the final composition, first rendered as a drawing in black and white. This drawing was used as a frontispiece to the [[The Hobbit 1st edition|first British printing]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in [[1937]]. The second version (with some minor changes<ref group=note>Most notably, perhaps, the windows of the mill and the words on the signpost, which in the drawing directs the traveller to [[Bag-End]] but in the painting to the Hill.</ref>), rendered in water colour by Tolkien, appeared as frontispiece to the second British impression of ''The Hobbit'' (also in 1937), and in the first American edition ([[1938]]).<ref name=AI>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 101-7</ref>

The coloured version has since been published several times. Early calendars reproducing the painting include ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar 1973]]'', ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar 1974]]'', and ''[[The Hobbit Calendar 1976]]''.

In the first edition of ''[[Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', a black-and white drawing depicting the same scene was published, said to be the ink frontispiece of the first printing of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. However, [[Christopher Tolkien]] wrote in his foreword to the second edition of ''Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien'' that this was an error; the drawing was, as has been noted by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], "a tracing Tolkien had made of the ink frontispiece [of the first printing of ''[[The Hobbit]]''] to transfer its outlines to a fresh sheet, on which he made the watercolour version".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.

==Inspiration==

[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that Tolkien might have been inspired by the picture "German Planes visiting Cassel" (see Gallery below), painted by Sir [[Wikipedia:William Orpen|William Orpen]] in 1917.<ref>{{webcite|author=Various|articleurl=http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?forum=17&post_id=16711|articlename=German Planes visiting Cassel by Sir William Orpen|dated=|website=Guide|accessed=21 November 2016}}</ref>
