'''''Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin''''' is a late work by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] found in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. It begins as a rewrite of the older work, ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', but regrettably went unfinished. It tells of how [[Tuor]] was raised, came to [[Vinyamar]], found [[Voronwë]], travelled towards [[Gondolin]] and passed through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]].

==Synopsis==

[[Tuor]] was the son of [[Rían]] and [[Huor]], born in the year of the battle [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Upon finding the news of her husband's death, followed  closely by her own, Rían left Tuor in the care of the [[Sindar]] of [[Mithrim]], specifically [[Annael]] who became his foster-father. Led by him, a small group sought refuge from the [[Easterlings]] in the caves of [[Androth]], where Tuor grew until he was 16, learning the elven lore and the mastering of weapons. Trying to leave [[Dor-lómin]], the group was attacked by the Easterlings and Tuor taken into slavery for 3 years, until he escaped and ran back to the caves of Androth, where he lived as an outlaw for another four.

Twenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoeadiad, in the first day of the new year Tuor began a journey west, towards the [[Ered Lómin]] mountains, in order to find the [[Gate of the Noldor]], following a small river which he considered to be a sign. With the help of [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] he passed through the gate and entered the coast known as [[Lammoth]]. Further on, he entered [[Nevrast]] and became the first of the race of [[Men]] to have seen the Great Sea [[Belegaer]].

Led by swans, Tuor found the city of [[Vinyamar]] on the slopes of [[Mount Taras]] and from the great halls he took the armour and weapons that [[Turgon]] had left, and then climbed down towards the sea once more. There, on the shores of Belegaer, the Vala [[Ulmo]] appeared before him and spoke of [[Gondolin]], where Tuor, with the help of the last sailor on the last ship to sail West at the command of [[Círdan]], would need to deliver a message on behalf of the Lord of the Waters.

The guide proved to be [[Voronwë]] and together they set towards East, making a stop at the [[Pools of Ivrin]] where they caught a glimpse of [[Túrin]], Tuor's cousin, set on a journey of his own. The two companions travelled further, to the tower [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] built by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and from there went South, following the road which climbed down in the Valley of the [[Sirion]]. 

From the [[Encircling Mountains|Echoriath]] they crossed the [[Ford of Brithiach]] and on the 37th day of their journey they entered the kingdom of Turgon. The first one they encountered was [[Elemmakil]], a [[Noldor]]in Elf, captain of those who guarded the outer entranceway to Gondolin. Under close guard they passed through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]]: [[Gate of Wood]], [[Gate of Stone]], [[Gate of Bronze]], [[Gate of Writhen Iron]], [[Gate of Silver]], [[Gate of Gold]] and the [[Gate of Steel]].

At the last one, [[Ecthelion]], lord of the [[People of the Fountain]] and keeper of the Great Gate at that time, appeared before their eyes.

==Incomplete Story==

Here, the detailed writing stops. In the published manuscript the tale is continued until Tuor is granted passage by Ecthelion and sets his eyes upon the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]], a passage taken from further incomplete notes of Tolkien, which would also contain a description of Gondolin and [[Turgon]], as well as the  first meeting of Tuor and [[Idril]], who became his wife. However, a final version of the tale was never completed.

==Tuor and Voronwë's route towards the Hidden City==

# [[Nevrast]]: [[Vinyamar]], [[Mount Taras]]
# [[Falas]] : [[Núath]], [[Pools of Ivrin]], [[Taeglin|The 3 springs of Taeglin]], [[Malduin|Spring of Malduin]]
# [[Vales of Sirion|Sirion]]: [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]]
# [[Dimbar]]: [[Ford of Brithiach]], [[Echoriath]] 
# [[Gondolin]] : [[Seven Gates of Gondolin]]

The entire journey took 37 days to complete and one more for the crossing of the gates.
