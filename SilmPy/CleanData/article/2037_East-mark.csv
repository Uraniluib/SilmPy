The '''East-mark''' was one of the three military divisions of [[Rohan]], with the others being the [[West-mark]], and the King's Lands around [[Edoras]]. The East-mark was defined as those lands that lay east of the [[Entwash]] and [[Snowbourn]] rivers. In military matters, the command of the [[Men]] of the East-mark would be given to one of Rohan's Marshals of the Riddermark. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] this was the [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshal]], the King's nephew [[Éomer]], who held his command at the ancient township of [[Aldburg]], the original capital of Rohan and the seat of his family.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref>
