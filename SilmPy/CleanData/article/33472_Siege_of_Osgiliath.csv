The '''Siege of Osgiliath''' occurred in {{TA|1437}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  During the [[Kin-strife]], [[Castamir]], a descendant of the kings, led a rebellion against [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], the son of King [[Valacar]].  Eldacar had the support of the [[Northmen]] in the service of Gondor and of the [[Dúnedain]] of the northern part of the realm, but they were overmatched by the forces of Castamir, drawn from the people of the coasts and of the great havens of [[Pelargir]] and [[Umbar]].  Although he fought valiantly, Eldacar was pushed back into capital and there besieged until Castamir's greater army and hunger drove him out.<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

In the siege and subsequent burning of the city the Tower of the [[Stone of Osgiliath]] was destroyed and the ''palantír'' was lost in the [[Anduin]].  When the city was taken, Castamir showed his cruel side, putting [[Ornendil]], the son of Eldacar, to death and causing slaughter and destruction far above the needs of war.<ref name="Gondor"/>
