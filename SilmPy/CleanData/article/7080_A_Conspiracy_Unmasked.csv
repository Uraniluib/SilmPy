'''A Conspiracy Unmasked''' is the fifth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Summary==
Up to this point, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had told his companions that he had been moving to [[Crickhollow]] to live. As they reached this destination, Frodo realized that his companions had known all along that he had to dispose of the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and they were committed to helping him. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] had already decided to accompany Frodo to [[Rivendell]]. They agreed that it was better to go through the [[Old Forest]] than the road. [[Fatty Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] was to stay behind to keep a normal appearance, so that others would think Frodo was living at Crickhollow. They retired for the night and Frodo dreamt that he was struggling to climb a tall tower near the seaside.
