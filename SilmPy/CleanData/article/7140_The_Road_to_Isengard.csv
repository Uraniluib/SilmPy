'''The Road to Isengard''' is the eighth chapter of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
King [[Théoden]], [[Gandalf]] the white rider, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Erkenbrand]], [[Éomer]], [[Gimli]] and the men of [[Rohan]] all gathered beside a stream. When Théoden asked Gandalf about his wizardry over the trees, Gandalf laughed and told them that it had not been his doing. He asked them to come with him to [[Isengard]] if they wished to know more about the trees.

After resting, the [[Men|men]] set forth again. They came to [[Orthanc]], the citadel of [[Saruman]] at Isengard. They were surprised to find that [[Treebeard]] and his [[Ents]] had destroyed the citadel, and that Saruman and [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] had hidden themselves away in [[Orthanc]], guarded by none other than [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Théoden, who was anxious to see Treebeard, said good-bye to the [[Hobbits]] and accompanied Gandalf to the Northern wall.
