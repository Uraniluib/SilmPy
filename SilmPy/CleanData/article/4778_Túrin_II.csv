}}'''Túrin II''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2815|n}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|2914|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 99 years) was the twenty-third [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]]. 
==History==
Túrin succeeded his father [[Thorondir]] at his death in {{TA|2882}}.<ref name="South"/>  [[Ithilien]] was attacked again by [[Mordor]] during his reign, and Gondor withdrew completely from the province. Only a few [[Rangers of Ithilien|rangers]] remained behind, hidden in the wilderness. It was Túrin who built secret refuges for his soldiers in Ithilien, of which [[Henneth Annûn]] was the longest guarded and manned. He also fortified the isle of [[Cair Andros]] to defend [[Anórien]].<ref name="Elendil"/>

In {{TA|2885|n}}, when Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King [[Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]] fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Túrin won a victory at the crossings of [[Poros]], though the princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Túrin was followed by his son [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]] at his death in {{TA|2914|n}}.<ref name="South"/>
