==Summary==
Tolkien told Brogan that he had gone into "retreat" in the summer and had successfully concluded ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  It had been read and approved by [[Rayner Unwin]], the original reader of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  There was a chance it would be published, said Tolkien, although at 1200 pages it would make no money for the publisher or the author.  Term had begun, which prevented him from revising the whole and sending it to the typists.  As soon as he had a spare copy he would loan one to Brogan, with explanatory matter, alphabets, history, calendars, and genealogies reserved for true "fans".  Perhaps by Christmas but he could not promise.  The business of earning a living by teaching, delivering lectures, and attending daily meetings interfered sadly with serious work.
