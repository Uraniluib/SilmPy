'''Dol Amroth''' was a promontory, ruled as a hereditary princedom, situated on a peninsula in [[Gondor]] facing the [[Bay of Belfalas]].

The emblem of the Prince of Dol Amroth was a silver-upon-blue banner, bearing a ship with a swan-prow upon the sea.<ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref>

==Description==
Its northern shore defined part of [[Cobas Haven]], the small bay into which the [[Morthond]] River flowed.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Upon the headland the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]] established a castle and thus Dol Amroth referred to this stronghold and to the neighbouring port-city, the chief city of the fief of [[Belfalas]].<ref name="Minas Tirith">{{RK|V1}}</ref> Within the walls of the city was the [[Sea-ward Tower]] or Tirith Aear,<ref>{{ATB|Preface}}</ref> which had a bell that was rung for the benefit of mariners.<ref>{{ATB|6}}</ref>

==History==
In the late [[First Age]], [[Sindar]] refugees from [[Beleriand]]<ref name="Amroth">{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> settled the area and established an Elven settlement about 50 miles north of the promontory, at [[Edhellond]]<ref name="GalCel" />

During the [[Second Age]], a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] family of the [[Faithful]] settled near the Elves.<ref name="Cirion" /> [[Elendil]], who was of their kin, gave them title to rule the fief of [[Belfalas]]. They built their stronghold upon the promontory.

Amroth, [[King of Lórien]] from the beginning of the Third Age,<ref name="GalCel" /> left his [[Lothlórien|realm]] behind in {{TA|1981}} in search of his beloved [[Nimrodel]], who had fled from the [[Balrog|horror]] unleashed by the [[Dwarves]] in [[Moria]], along with numerous [[Galadhrim]]. He waited for her at Edhellond, for their final voyage together into the West. But Nimrodel, who loved [[Middle-earth]] as much as she did Amroth, failed to join him. When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her, and drowned in the bay.<ref name="GalCel" /> When [[Amroth]] was lost at sea in {{TA|1981}} the last of these Elves left the region.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> It was from the name of this king that Dol Amroth (the "Hill of Amroth") took its name. The first Prince of Dol Amroth was [[Galador]], the son of [[Imrazôr]]. According to legend, Imrazôr had married the Elven-lady [[Mithrellas]], a companion of Nimrodel.<ref name="Cirion" />

Being a coastal city, Dol Amroth was subject to occasional attacks by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. The fifteenth prince was slain in battle against these sea raiders in {{TA|2746}}.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The House of Dol Amroth'', p. 222</ref>

In all there were twenty-one Princes of Dol Amroth before the twenty-second, [[Imrahil]], led a company of knights and a contingent of 700 men from the city to [[Minas Tirith]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="Minas Tirith"/>

==Population==
The first settlers of the area were [[Sindar]] from Beleriand (later joined by many [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elves of Lothlórien]])<ref name="Amroth" /> until the [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] came to the promontory in the late [[Second Age]].<ref name="Cirion"/> The last Elves left in {{TA|1981}}.

The Faithful and later the [[Gondorians]] that settled in Dol Amroth never married with [[Middle Men]] so the citizens were of Númenórean blood<ref name="Men">{{App|Men}}</ref> and, according to the legend of Mithrellas, their Princes had an Elvish strain.<ref name="GalCel">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref><ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> In addition to their apparent Elven blood, the family of [[Númenóreans]], in which the [[House of Dol Amroth]] originates from, were akin to the [[Lords of Andúnië]], and thus related to [[Elendil]] and descended from the legendary [[House of Elros]].<ref name="Cirion" />

The people of Dol Amroth were tall, grey-eyed, and dark-haired.<ref name="Minas Tirith"/> They were famous as the most skilful harp players in all of Gondor, who played at the coronation of [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> The inhabitants of Dol Amroth and in the lands nearby were some of the few people of Gondor who spoke [[Sindarin]] on a daily basis.<ref name="Men" />

==Etymology==
''Dol Amroth'' is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[dol]]'' "hill" and ''[[Amroth]]'' "Upclimber".{{fact}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dol Amroth was the largest city in the region of Western [[Gondor]]. It was ruled by [[Lothíriel]] in her father's absence. There were two gates to the city, one in the east leading to the waterfront and one in the west leading up to the city proper. The city was threatened by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]], who blockaded the port and briefly managed to capture the city.
