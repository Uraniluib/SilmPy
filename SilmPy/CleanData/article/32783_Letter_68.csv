==Summary==
Tolkien spent a morning writing and was within sight of [[Minas Morgul|Minas Morghul]].<ref group="note">"Morgul" was still "Morghul" at this time.</ref>  He had not gotten new copies typed to send to Christopher because he was pushing on and could not wait to make fair copies.  He made up a sentence between [[Faramir]] to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]: "When you return to the lands of the living, and we re-tell our tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell me then."<ref group="note">A similar line appears at the end of "[[The Forbidden Pool]]" chapter in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'': "''If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old grief, you shall tell me then.''"</ref>
