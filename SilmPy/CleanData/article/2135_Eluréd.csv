'''Eluréd''' ({{FA|500}}<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref> – {{FA|506|n}}<ref>{{WJ|Years}}</ref>) was a son of [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]].  He had a twin brother named [[Elurín]] and a sister [[Elwing]], and all three had been born in [[Lanthir Lamath]] while [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] lived there.  However, after the host of the [[Naugrim]] had plundered [[Menegroth]], Dior brought his family to the Thousand Caves to renew the kingdom of [[Doriath]].

But soon, after not many years had passed, a messenger brought the [[Nauglamír]] to Dior, which told him that Beren and Lúthien were gone from the world.  The news that Necklace of the Dwarves, which bore one of the [[Silmarils]], was in Dior's keeping provoked the sons of [[Fëanor]] to attack Menegroth.  Dior and Nimloth were slain and Eluréd and Elurín were captured (Elwing escaped with the Silmaril).  The two young boys were taken into the woods by the servants of [[Celegorm]] and left to starve.  [[Maedhros]] repented and sought for the two but never found them.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The [[Sindarin]] name is said to mean the same as the boy's father's name, [[Eluchíl]], that is, "Heir of Elu".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>
==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In an early stage, Eluréd was called "[[Elbereth]]", an [[Ilkorin]] name containing the word ''bereth'' "valor". During the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name was applied to [[Varda]], and the original meaning<ref group=note>Thus probably envisioned as *"star-valor"</ref> was struck out and the character was renamed "Eldún".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries '''BARATH''', '''BER'''</ref>

In the genealogical table of the [[House of Bëor]], "Eldún"'s date of birth was given as {{FA}} 492 (and he was not a twin).  He and his brother did die in {{FA|506|n}} but their father died in {{FA|511|n}}.  In commentary following the table, [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained the year of 511 for Dior's death was incorrect and that in later sources the two brothers were twins born in {{FA|500}}.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor</ref>
