'''North Sindarin''', also called '''Mithrimin''' or just '''Mithrim''',<ref>{{PE|17}} p.134</ref><ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref> is an extinct dialect of [[Sindarin]]. It was spoken in [[Mithrim]] and the highlands of [[Beleriand]].

==History==
The [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] were divided in several groups, and their language had developed some dialects. North Sindarin, the flavour of Sindarin spoken by the ''Mithrim'', the northernmost group of the Sindar, differed from the Sindarin of Beleriand proper in many aspects. It was this language which was adopted by the exiled [[Noldor]] after their return to [[Middle-earth]], and by their mortal allies, the [[House of Beor]]. During this time North Sindarin was changed much, partially due to the adoption of [[Quenya]] features, and partially due to the love of the Noldor for making linguistic changes. [[Beren]]'s heritage was clear to [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] as he spoke the North Sindarin of his homeland.

North Sindarin retained many features of Archaic Sindarin which had been lost in the Sindarin of Beleriand proper, but also went through several changes of its own: lenition occurred far less in this dialect than in the other dialects.

After the end of the [[First Age]], the survivors of Beleriand's realms generally adopted the more southern variants of Sindarin, but several proper names which are uninterpretable in normal Sindarin which remained in use during the [[Third Age]] show North Sindarin influence.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In Tolkien's earliest writings, there was a language called [[Ilkorin]], the language of the Ilkorindi (the [[Dark Elves]] who stayed in [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]]). After Tolkien evolved his mythology, the background and setting of the stories changed, and Ilkorin was replaced by [[Sindarin]], the language of the [[Sindar]].

[[Edward Kloczko]] observed that the few words mentioned as "Mithrim" fit to the phonological changes and principles seen in Ilkorin: for example Mithrim has ''ô'' where Sindarin has ''au'', and retains final ''-v'' and ''-m'' where Sindarin has final ''-w''; he theorized that Tolkien recycled parts of Ilkorin as Mithrim.<ref>Edward Kloczko, "Ilkorin and North Sindarin", in [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 9|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' #9]], October [[1996]]</ref>
===The case of cw===
However, Sindarin and Mithrim descended from [[Common Telerin]], where the primitive sound ''kw'' (seen in Quenya as ''qu''), was simplified in ''p'' (cf. Quenya ''[[quár]]'' against Telerin ''[[Pār]]'' and Sindarin ''[[paur]]''). 

This setting is part only of the later conception and Ilkorin, which belongs to earlier version, does not reflect this: primitive ''kw'' stays ''cw'' or ''c'' in some Ilkorin words such as ''alch'' ([[LAK|ALÁK<sup>w</sup>Â]]), ''côm'' ([[KWAM|K<sup>w</sup>AM]]), ''cwess'' ([[KWESS|K<sup>w</sup>ESS]]), ''salch'' ([[SALÁK|SALÁK<sup>w</sup>Ê]]) something that would be impossible in a Sindarin dialect.

If we are to update Ilkorin to North Sindarin (the way some update [[Noldorin]] in [[Neo-Sindarin]]), these words would possibly become ''*alph, *pôm, *pess, *salph''.
===Context===
Another problem with the identification of Ilkorin with North Sindarin is that the Ilkorin words which have survived in the [[canon]] as Sindarin, have little to do with the Mithrim. 

In the early legendarium, the Ilkorindi were the vernacular Elves of all Beleriand, and therefore Ilkorin names are to be found in almost all the range of the stories. Names Tolkien marked as Ilkorin have to do with [[Doriath]] ([[Thingol]], [[Beleg]], [[Belthronding]], [[Aros]]), [[Ossiriand]] ([[Lindon]], [[Brilthor]], [[Duilwen]]) or the [[Falas]] ([[Brithon]], [[Brithombar]]).

Another example is the name [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], the lake in [[Rhovanion]] where [[Men]] dwelt in the [[Third Age]], which Tolkien listed as Ilkorin; ''[[The Hobbit]]'' was written in [[1937]] while Tolkien still worked on ''[[The Etymologies]]''.

The Mithrim on the other hand would hardly give names to those locations. There is little room of speculation of why a First Age Mithrimin dialect should reach Ossiriand, or even Rhovanion of the Third Age.
===Mithrimin and Doriathrin===
The word ''[[lómin]]'' (cf. [[Dor-Lómin]]) was a variant of ''lómen'' "echoing", both in [[Doriathrin]]<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry LAM</ref>, another dialect of Tolkien's early legendarium; Doriathrin shows adjectives ending in ''-in'' instead of standard Sindarin ''[[-en]]'' (''[[Dungorthin]], [[muilin]]'').

Tolkien later redefined ''lómin'' as a Mithrimin word, as an example of the absence of [[a-affection]] in the dialect<ref>{{PE|17}} p.133</ref>, something which would result in ''-in'' endings. 

However unlike Doriathrin and Mithrimin, Ilkorin shows the ending ''-en'' (''[[thúren]], [[Mablosgen]]'') but also ''-in'' (''[[Ermabin]]'')
