'''''Sub-creating Middle-earth: Constructions of Authorship and the Works of J.R.R. Tolkien''''' is a collection of six essays examining [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] as an author. It was published as No. 27 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.

==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|Authorship in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien is a subject of many facets. Within the mythology and history of Middle-earth, many story-tellers, bards, annalists and poets contribute to the weaving of an enormous tapestry of tales. Sub-creation, as Tolkien practiced it, involves an abundance of traditions, including different modes of authorship and literary creation – and some depart strikingly from the common modern notions. Instead of proposing a unified perception, the six articles in this collection therefore examine the web of authorial presence and authorship concepts in Tolkien's works from diverse angles, to trace a polyphonous dialogue between the writer of the texts and the many voices within that shape Middle-earth in concert.}}
