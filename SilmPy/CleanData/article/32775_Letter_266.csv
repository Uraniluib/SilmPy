==Summary==
Tolkien's grandson was studying English at St. Andrew’s University and Tolkien apologized that his translations of the Middle English poems ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'' were not ready to assist him.  It was very difficult to render verse into verse when translating, yet Tolkien felt that his version gave a reader a more direct impression of the poem’s impact.
