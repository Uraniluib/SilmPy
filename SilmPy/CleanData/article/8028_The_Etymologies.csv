'''The Etymologies''' is the first, and indeed only, chapter of the 'Part Three' of ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''. In his preface to that volume, [[Christopher Tolkien]] describes ''The Etymologies'' as "a kind of historical dictionary", and associates the work with the years [[1937]]-[[1938]], prior to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|his father]]'s work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Etymologies folio 93.png|thumb|left|''Etymologies'' folio 93]]
In ''The Etymologies'', Tolkien provides a series of [[Elvish]] linguistic root syllables, or "bases".  He then shows how each base evolved into various words in the various Elvish languages, primarily [[Qenya]] and [[Noldorin]], but also about ten other variations.  Although the derived words cannot necessarily be said to be in their final forms, as Tolkien's invented languages continued to evolve throughout his life, as Christopher Tolkien points out, this document "''enormously increases the known vocabularies of the Elvish tongues''".

==Addenda and Corrigenda==
In [[2003]] and [[2004]], [[Vinyar Tengwar 45|''Vinyar Tengwar'' issues 45]] and [[Vinyar Tengwar 46|46]] provided addenda and corrigenda to the original published text of ''The Etymologies'', with previously unknown entries and roots. In [[2007]], ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' issue [[Parma Eldalamberon 17|17]] provided even more entries.
