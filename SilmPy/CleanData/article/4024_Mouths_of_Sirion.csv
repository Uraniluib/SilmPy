The '''Mouths of Sirion''' was the great delta where the [[Sirion]], the main river of [[Beleriand]], emptied into the sea, in the north-east corner of the [[Bay of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> The land about the mouths was named ''[[Lisgardh]]'';<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref> it was a region of reeds dense as a forest.<ref name="Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

==History==
Between {{YT|1090}} and {{YT|1092|n}} the [[Valar]] assailed [[Morgoth]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{MR|P2e}}, §48</ref> In the upheavals of that time the Sirion was created and its waters first flowed into the Bay of Balar, creating the Mouths of Sirion.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>

During the years of Morgoth's captivity the [[Sindar]] spread across [[Beleriand]] and [[Círdan]] with his mariners explored the coasts.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Doubtless they knew of the place where Sirion met [[Belegaer|the Great Sea]], but no secret refuge was hidden in the reeds until much later, in {{FA|473}},<ref>{{GA|257}}</ref> the year after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. That was when [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were destroyed by Morgoth's forces and Círdan with the remnants of his people fled to the [[Isle of Balar]] or to the Mouths of Sirion where they established the secret havens.<ref name="Fifth"/>

In {{FA|506}}<ref name="Years">{{WJ|Years}}</ref> the [[Second Kinslaying]] occurred. [[Doriath]] was destroyed and those few who escaped, including [[Elwing]], fled to the Havens of Sirion.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> In {{FA|510}} [[Gondolin]] fell and by the next year<ref name="Years"/> refugees from that kingdom, including [[Idril]] and [[Tuor]], came to the Havens.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> [[Drúedain]] refugees from the fall of the [[Haladin]] came also to the Mouths of Sirion, reduced to a small number of families of mainly women and children.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>

[[Eärendil]] wedded Elwing in {{FA|525}}<ref name="Years"/> and he was accounted the lord of those living in the Havens of Sirion. Eärendil became a friend of Círdan and with his aid built his ship [[Vingilot]], in which he sailed west but was unable to reach [[Valinor]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> Having learned of the survival of [[Elwing]] and [[Eärendil]], [[Maedhros]] mustered a troupe to retrieve the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] that had been [[Fëanor|his father's]]. While Earendil was away in {{FA|538}}<ref name="Years"/> the sons of [[Fëanor]] attacked and though the forces of the remaining [[Sons of Fëanor]] were not very large, they ravaged the Havens and slaughtered most of the people. They could not find the Silmaril, however nor Elwing who went into the [[Belegaer|Sea]] with it, and Círdan and [[Gil-galad]] were too late to do anything. Elwing's sons, [[Elros]] and [[Elrond]], had been found by [[Maglor]], who and raised them well out of pity and remorse. Those few who escaped this [[Third Kinslaying]] went to the Isle of Balar in the ships of Círdan and [[Gil-galad]]. From that time on the Havens were in ruins and deserted.<ref name="Earendil"/>

The chief army of the Valar landed at the Mouths of Sirion during the [[War of Wrath]]. By the end of the War, most of the survivors of Beleriand gathered at the Mouths and the Isle of Balar, and many of them went to [[Lindon]] until the Elves were summoned to Valinor, and the Edain to the new isle of [[Númenor]].
