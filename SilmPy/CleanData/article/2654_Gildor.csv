'''Gildor Inglorion''' was a [[Noldor|Noldorin]] [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[House of Finrod]], who in the [[Third Age]] lived in [[Rivendell]]. 

==History==
Gildor was probably the son of some [[Inglor]]<ref name=halls>{{webcite|author=Matt Light, Lowell R. Matthews|articleurl=http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2000/jul/gildorshalls.html|articlename=Gildor's Halls|dated=2000|website=The Tolkien List}}</ref> and one of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]] of the House of Finrod. It's possible that he was from around Rivendell.<ref>{{RGEO|Elbereth}}</ref>

Elven [[Wandering Companies]] crossed the [[Shire]] every Spring and Autumn. Around [[September]] {{TA|3001}}, as [[Bilbo Baggins]] was leaving the Shire for Rivendell, Gildor met the [[hobbit]] as he waved them farewell in [[Woody End]]. The following years he met him once more, perhaps at Rivendell.<ref name="3IC"/><ref name=halls/>

In September {{TA|3018}}, he traveled eastwards with a company of Elves of Rivendell. They were returning from the [[Emyn Beraid]], where they went to see [[Varda|Elbereth]] in the ''[[Elostirion-stone|palantír]]'' that was kept there. On the [[24 September|24th]], they met [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]] on the road near the Woody End. They ate and sang, and Gildor discussed the peril that haunted the three [[hobbits]]. This peril, a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]], was near, but fled as he heard the Elves chant of Elbereth. Because of Frodo's ability to speak [[Elvish]], Gildor gave him the title [[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]].<ref name="3IC"/>

After separating from the hobbits, he sent word to the house of [[Tom Bombadil]], probably before the [[26 September|26th]].<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref> He also spoke with [[Aragorn]]<ref>{{FR|I10}}</ref> and sent a message to [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref>

Two years later, on [[22 September|September 22]], {{TA|3021}}, he met the Hobbits once again. He accompanied a riding of great Lords and Ladies, that planned to sail [[Aman|West]] on board the [[White Ship]]<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref> and probably he was among the Elves who sailed to the West.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Gildor Inglorion"</ref><ref group=note>The narrative does not specify whether Gildor also boarded the ship to the West or if he was simply present as a companion.</ref>

==Ancestry ==
Gildor is one of the less prominently featured Elves, yet he seems important enough to raise questions concerning his lineage, or the identity of this character. Gildor calls himself  "Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod". He also says: "We are Exiles, and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]."<ref name="3IC"/> 
 
It should be noted that Tolkien initially used names from his (unpublished) ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' writings rather at random in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first drafts of the sequel which would become ''The Lord of the Rings'': other examples are the mention of [[Gondolin]] and the appearance of [[Elrond]] in ''The Hobbit'', which were only later brought into alignment with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the unpublished mythology by a third edition of the book.<ref name="L257">{{L|257}}</ref> This therefore is the case of the reference to the name "Finrod".

The name "Gildor" first appeared in the outlines of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in February [[1938]],<ref>{{RS|Hobbiton}} (p. 45)</ref> and in Tolkien's notes of that time, "Finrod" still meant the character later known as [[Finarfin]]<ref name="RC3IC">{{HM|RC}}, "[[Three is Company]]", pages 103-4</ref> and [[Finrod|his son]] had the older name "[[Inglor]]".

===Connection to Finarfin===
However the name [[Inglor]] reappeared, in [[Quenya]] form, for Finarfin (who in the earlier legendarium, was named Finrod). Finarfin's [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Ingalaurë]]''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 30</ref> If Ingalaurë is to be translated in [[Sindarin]] according to the [[Sindarization|sound-changing rules]], this would become ''Inglor''. Thus, the connection of Gildor to the house of Finrod/Finarfin still remains in the updated legendarium.

This all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he probably became a member of the House of Finrod as one of its servants, not one of its sons — perhaps one of the knights of [[Nargothrond]].

It is also possible that he was a son of a supposed "Inglor" — a character unconnected to Finrod Felagund.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Adapter [[Brian Sibley]] wanted to use as much of the original Elvish lines as possible. This meant that the heavily wounded Frodo told the line ''Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo'' to Glorfindel instead. 

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' 
:A scene that was shot on the third day of principal photography, "[[The Passing of the Elves]]", is a reference to this passage in the book. It was eventually cut from the theatrical release to postpone the introduction of [[Elves]] to [[Rivendell]].<ref name="PJ">[[Peter Jackson]], [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]] (adaptors), [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]], "[[The Passing of the Elves]]", Directors' Commentary</ref> In the scene, Frodo and Sam have a meal when Frodo notices Elves in the distance. No interaction is made, and the Elves travel ''to'' the Grey Havens, not from the [[Emyn Beraid]] to [[Rivendell]].<ref>[[Peter Jackson]], [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]] (adaptors), [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]], "[[The Passing of the Elves]]"</ref> They overhear the Elves singing a sad song, which is in fact a translation into [[Sindarin]] of [[J.R.R.

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
: Despite not featuring in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card depicting the character.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:This video game features both [[Tom Bombadil]] and [[Glorfindel]]. Tom apparently knows nothing of Frodo carrying the Ring, yet Glorfindel does - he is sent out by Elrond. Elrond had received a message, but from whom this message came is left untold.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gildor makes a brief appearance in the [[Bree-land Introduction#Hobbit Summary|Hobbit introduction]] to the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar|Shadows of Angmar]]'' driving out a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] in [[the Shire]]. 
:He is also the representative for the elves for the Council of the North in the third book to the ''Shadows of Angmar'': ''[[The Council of the North]]'' and appears in Chapter five, "Tending the Glade".
