The '''Bridge of Khazad-dûm''' was a narrow stone bridge crossing a chasm within the eastern gates of the Dwarf-city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. It was intended for defensive purposes — enemies who breached the outer defences would be forced to cross a span of about fifty feet in single file. The depth of the chasm was incredible and the ceiling was high; on the outer side of the bridge was a flight of stairs leading to the exit, through the [[First Hall]] and the [[Great Gates]] of [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>

The bridge is most noted for being the location of the encounter between [[Gandalf]] and the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]]. It was broken by Gandalf during the fight but would most likely have been repaired by [[Dwarves]] after the [[War of the Ring]], since it was on the main approach to the city from the east.
