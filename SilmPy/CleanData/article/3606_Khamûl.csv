==History==
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider.jpg|thumb|left|''Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider'' by [[Stephen Hickman]]]]
He was a king of [[Easterlings]] during the [[Second Age]], and he was one of the nine Men to whom Sauron gave [[Nine Rings|one of the Rings of Power]]. Like the others, he became a powerful sorcerer and ruler until eventually faded into a [[Wraiths|Wraith]] and his will was surrendered to Sauron.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> By {{SA|2251}} he was already one of Sauron's servants.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

It was said that, after the Witch-king, Khamûl was most ready to perceive the presence of [[the One Ring]], but his power was most confused and diminished by daylight.  

In {{TA|2951}} Sauron returned to [[Mordor]] and declared openly to his enemies. Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths were sent to the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] and Khamûl took command.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

During the [[War of the Ring]] he was one of the Ringwraiths who entered [[the Shire]], and asked [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]] for "Baggins". However it was the day after [[Frodo Baggins]] had left [[Hobbiton]], and he then pursued the [[Hobbits]] to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the Shire some days later.<ref name="Note1"/>

Following the destruction of the One Ring, Khamûl perished with the rest of the Ringwraiths.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl in charge of Dol Guldur is known simply as "The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur", formerly "The Cursed Rider". He is said to have been an Easterling chieftain who wielded the Ring "Orôm, the Warmonger".
