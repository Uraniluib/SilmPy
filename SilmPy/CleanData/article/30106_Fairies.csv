==Inspiration and Etymology==

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s concept of ''Faërie'' uses a deliberate variant spelling of ''fairy''. While both spellings derive from [[Middle English]] ''faie'' ("possessing magical powers"), the name ''fairy'' carries connotations of 'prettiness'. Tolkien wanted to distance himself from this modern sense, and by using ''Faërie'' (variants included ''Faery'' and ''Fayery'') he sought "''connotations older and considerably darker''".<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, p. 85</ref>
