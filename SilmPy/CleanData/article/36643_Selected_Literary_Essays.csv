==From the publisher==

This volume, available in print for the first time since 1980, includes over twenty of C. S. Lewis' most important literary essays, written between 1932 and 1962. The topics discussed range from Chaucer to Kipling, from 'The literary impact of the authorised version' to 'Psycho-analysis and literary criticism', from Shakespeare and Bunyan to Sir Walter Scott and William Morris. Common to each essay, however, are the lively wit, the distinctive forthrightness, and the discreet erudition which characterise Lewis' best critical writing.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Selected-Literary-Essays-C-Lewis/dp/0521296803 Selected Literary Essays] at [http://www.amazon.com/ref=gno_logo Amazon.com] (accessed 27 October 2011)</ref>
