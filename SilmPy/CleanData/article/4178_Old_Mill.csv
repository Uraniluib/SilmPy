The '''Old Mill''' was the water-mill of [[Hobbiton]], owned and run by the [[Sandyman Family]].<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref> The Old Mill was a corn mill powered by a large water wheel. It lay directly adjacent to the bridge across [[the Water]] and next to the [[Old Grange]] as well.

==History==
In {{SR|1341}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Bilbo Baggins]] ran by the Mill and a mile beyond to get to the [[Green Dragon]] to meet [[Thorin and Company]].<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> By {{SR|1418}} [[Sandyman]] had been the miller for some time and passed down his craft to his son, [[Ted Sandyman|Ted]]. [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] bought the mill, and many other buildings in [[Hobbiton]], before he moved in to [[Bag End]]. When [[Saruman|Sharkey]] came to [[the Shire]], the Mill was knocked down and replaced by a New Mill, operated by Ted Sandyman and several [[Ruffians]]. After Sharkey was driven out, this new brick building was demolished.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the original version of [[Thorin]]'s letter to Bilbo the rendezvous point for the beginning of the journey to the [[Lonely Mountain]] was the Great Mill.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref> This was only changed to the Green Dragon in the page proofs just before the story was published.<ref name="TrollNotes">{{HH|Trolls}}, note 2, p. 98</ref>

==Inspiration==
The [[Sarehole Mill]] and its millers formed the inspiration for the Old Mill.<ref name="TrollNotes"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
