The '''[[Leonid Korablev]] Calendar''' is a single-sheet calendar created in [[1995]]. It is actually a syncretic or 'universal' calendar which combines the [[Reckoning of Rivendell]] and the [[King's Reckoning]], neatly fitting the 12 ''[[astar]]'' of the latter in the 6 ‘seasons’ of the former, and these regularized in the astronomical positions of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] as observed by the peoples of [[Middle-earth]]. 

For example, the year begins on the [[yestare]] of 25 March (vernal equinox, which is also the [[Cormare]]); the first ''asta'' is [[Víresse]], being the first half of the ‘season’ [[Tuile]].

Each ‘season’ has normally 54 days since each month has 27 days. The exceptions are the ‘seasons’ [[Laire]] and [[Hríve]] who last 72 days since each of their ''astar'' are 36 days long.

As in the [[Shire Reckoning]], the days of the week are fixed to each date. That means that 1 Víresse of each year, falls always on day [[Elenya]].
