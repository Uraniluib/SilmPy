'''Mirkwood''' ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Mirkwood)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]'') or the '''Forest of Great Fear''' ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Taur-e-Ndaedelos]]'') was a great forest in [[Rhovanion]]. It was only known by these names in the latter part of the [[Third Age]], having previously been called [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Mirkwood|Eryn Galen]]'') and later became the [[Eryn Lasgalen|Wood of Greenleaves]] ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]'').

== Geography ==
Mirkwood seems to have had much the same boundaries as it did at the end of the Third Age for most of its history. It was roughly rectangular in shape: stretching from the foothills of the [[Grey Mountains]] in the north to the [[North Undeep]] in the south, and from the east edge of the vale of [[Anduin]] to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

It was bisected by the ancient [[Old Forest Road]]. Later, when this road became unusable, a second path through the forest was made to the north. Between the two paths lay the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]]. The [[Forest River]] cut through the forest's northern end from its source in the western Grey Mountains, joined in the centre by the [[Enchanted River]] which flowed north from the Mountains of Mirkwood.

South of the Old Forest road the [[East Bight]] created the ''Narrows of the Forest'', only one hundred miles across. South and west of the narrows was the a hill called [[Amon Lanc]].

== History ==

Originally called Greenwood the Great, the forest may have once formed part of the vast primeval woodland which covered most of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Years of the Trees]], possibly linked to Lothlórien across the Anduin.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}} p. 252</ref> The [[Eldar]] passed through the area on their [[Great Journey|journey]] to [[Valinor]] and it was first populated at this time by the [[Nandor]]. Unwilling to cross the [[Misty Mountains]], these Elves settled also in the wooded valleys of the river Anduin. They multiplied and were joined by wandering [[Avari]], becoming known as Silvan or Wood-elves.

The Old Forest Road was constructed very early in Greenwood's history by the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] to carry traffic between their territory in the Misty Mountains to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and the [[Iron Hills]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>

=== Second Age ===

In around the year {{SA|750}} the [[Sinda]] prince, [[Oropher]], removed from [[Lindon]] to Greenwood where he was taken by the Silvan Elves as their lord. This forested region to the east of the [[Anduin]] is where [[Silvan Elves]], of [[Nandor]] descent and the [[Avari]], lived.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> Oropher built his halls at [[Amon Lanc]] and was accepted as the leader of the Wood-elves of Greenwood, later the [[Elves of Mirkwood]], forming the [[Woodland Realm]].

=== Third Age ===

The first millennium of the Third Age probably saw the creation of the East Bight by men living in the eastern eaves of the forest. These men may have formed part of the [[Rhovanion|Kingdom of Rhovanion]] led by [[Vidugavia]]. Men, such as the [[Éothéod]], and [[Hobbits]] also lived in the vale of Anduin and were likely responsible for the retreat of the forest's western border.

At the beginning of the Third Age [[Thranduil]] replaced [[Oropher]] as king of the Woodland Realm. Probably as a result of massive losses at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] the Silvan population of Greenwood was diminished and became mainly concentrated in the hills then known as [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Emyn Duir]]. This included the abandonment of Amon Lanc, and around the turn of the first millennium [[Sauron]], under the guise of the '[[Necromancer]]', returned to Middle-earth and in {{TA|1050}} built a fortress there. The hill and the fortress together become known as [[Dol Guldur]], the "Hill of Sorcery".

Sauron's arrival caused a darkening of Greenwood, and at this point it became known as Mirkwood. The children of [[Shelob]], giant [[spiders]], as well as bats and orcs in Dol Guldur's service occupied the forest and it became thicker, darker and covered in cobwebs.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>

This caused the Silvan population of Mirkwood to retreat even further, residing apparently exclusively in the [[Elvenking's Halls]] at the eastern end of the Forest River. The ancient Old Forest Road was abandoned by men and Dwarves alike, with a new but seldom used path being made further from Dol Guldur and the Hobbits near the forest's eastern border migrated away.

Mirkwood remained a place of fear throughout the Third Age, though the kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and [[Dale]] flourished briefly in the time of the [[King under the Mountain|Kings under the Mountain]]. This prosperity was ended by the arrival of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] who brought yet further desolation to the area north-eastern Mirkwood. Small homesteads of 'Woodmen' are also recorded as living in the western edge of the forest south of the old road in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref>{{HM|H}}, "Map of Wilderland"</ref>

In {{TA|2850|n}} [[Gandalf]] visited Mirkwood and discovered that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron, who had regained his powers, millennia after the Battle of Dagorlad.

[[File:Galadriel dol guldur bfmeII.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Galadriel casts down the walls of Dol Guldur.''.]]
The shadow over Mirkwood was lifted, albeit temporarily, in {{TA|2941|n}} when the [[White Council]], prompted by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]]'s discovery of his true identity, drove Sauron from Dol Guldur. Gandalf also instigated the [[Quest of Erebor]] which resulted in the slaying of Smaug in the same year. The combination of these two events allowed the re-established kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, as well as the Woodland Realm and a confederacy of Woodmen led by the [[Beornings]] to flourish for a brief period.

However, only ten years after these events Sauron, now based in [[Mordor]], sent the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and the other [[Nazgûl]] to secretly reoccupy Dol Guldur and begin amassing an army of Orcs and [[Easterlings]] there. In {{TA|3018|n}} these attacked the Woodland Realm, as well as Dale, Erebor and Lórien, in the opening moves of the [[War of the Ring]].

On 19 March {{TA|3019|n}} Thranduil repulsed Sauron's forces in a bloody battle under the trees and mounted a campaign to clear northern Mirkwood of Sauron's servants. At the same time the elves of Lórien led by [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] assaulted and destroyed Dol Guldur, and began to cleanse the southern part of the forest. Celeborn and Thranduil met in the midst of the forest on [[Elven New Year]] and formally renamed the forest Eryn Lasgalen. They then agreed to divide it between the Woodland Realm from the northern edge of the forest to the mountains, the Beornings from the mountains to the Narrows and [[East Lórien]] from the Narrows south.

=== Fourth Age ===

Though initially they prospered as the darkness was lifted, the elves of the Wood of Greenleaves were destined either to depart for Valinor or fade into rustic forest spirits. The forest probably then ultimately fell under the dominion of men, the descendent of the Beornings and the men of Dale.

== Etymology ==
''Mirkwood'' is the Anglicized form of the Norse name ''[[wikipedia:Myrkviðr|Myrkviðr]]'' or ''mirkiwidu'', originally hailing from [[Poetic Edda|Eddaic poems]]. Myrkviðr was the name of a "dark boundary-forest ... the great forest that divided the land of the Goths from the land of the Huns".<ref>{{HM|SG}}, pp. 131, 227-8, 372</ref> In a letter to his grandson Michael, Tolkien says that "''Mirkwood'' is not an invention of mine", and continues to discuss the origin of the name in [[Old English]] and [[Old Norse]] writings.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Michael George Tolkien (29 July 1966)]]" (letter; partly published as [[letter 289]])</ref>

Projected into Old English, the term appears as ''Myrcwudu'' in Tolkien's ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]'', as a poem sung by [[Ælfwine]]<ref>{{HM|LR}}: "The Lost Road: (iii) The unwritten chapters": ''[[King Sheave]]'' and note to line 150</ref>:
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Sea-danes and Goths, Swedes and Northmen,
Franks and Frisians, folk of the islands,
Swordmen and Saxons, Swabes and English,
and the Langobards who long ago
beyond Myrcwudu a mighty realm
and wealth won them in the Welsh countries
where Ælfwine Eadwine's heir
in Italy was king. All that has passed.
</poem>

The name ''Mirkwood'' was also used by [[William Morris]] in his novel ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'' ([[1888]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 13</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:Mirkwood is the setting of two large chapters of the game: the first one involves rescuing of Dwarves from the Spiders, while the second covers the Halls of King [[Thranduil]] and subsequent escape.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Several missions of both good and evil campaigns take place in Mirkwood. In the Evil campaign, the [[Witch-King]] is reclaiming [[Dol Guldur]] for Sauron, while in the Good campaign [[Legolas]] and elven archers pursue the escaped [[Gollum]].

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Mirkwood is one the battlefields for the non-storyline engagements.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Mirkwood makes appearance in both Good campaign and non-storyline skirmishes, in both cases the map is very different from the one in the first game.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Southern Mirkwood and Dol Guldur are the setting of the game's second expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood]]''. In its storyline, Celeborn and Galadriel organize a military campaign against Dol Guldur while the Fellowship still resides in Lothlorien (not to be confused with the later battle during the War of the Ring). The announced goal is to saw chaos into Orc forces by destroying as many of their troops, weapons and supplies as possible, to delay an inevitable assault upon Lothlorien. The true purpose, however, is to distract the Eye of Sauron from the company departing down the shores of Anduin. An assault by the Golden Host of the Galadhrim is successful despite minor losses and after establishing multiple camps throughout southern Mirkwood arrives at the walls of the fortress itself. However, without the White Lady they do not have the means of bringing down the walls, so the Elves prepare to swiftly fall back beyond Anduin before the main forces of the Enemy arrive.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Mirkwood is the setting of one the missions in the game, where [[Eradan]], [[Farin]] and [[Andriel]] have to rescue [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] from a giant spider.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Mirkwood scenes were shot both on set in the studio and on location.
