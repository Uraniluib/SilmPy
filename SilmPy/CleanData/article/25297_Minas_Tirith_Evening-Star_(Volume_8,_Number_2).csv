'''''Minas Tirith Evening-Star'' (Volume 8, Number 2)''' is an issue of the journal ''[[Minas Tirith Evening-Star]]''. It includes the article ''An Interview with J.R.R.T.'', which is a transcription of an [[Index:Audio recordings of J.R.R. Tolkien|interview]] with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] by [[Denys Gueroult]].

*Note: This interview could be either the [[1964 BBC Interview]] or the [[1965 BBC Interview]]. The confusion arises from the following four different accounts:
**(1) [[Pieter Collier]] has stated that Dennis Gueroult "from the BBC Radio 4 program 'Now Read On' did broadcast the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[1964 BBC Interview]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> for the first time in 1971".<ref>http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/804-Tolkien_1971_BBC_Interview.php - 1971 BBC radio interview with J.R.R. Tolkien </ref>
**(2) [[Jason Fisher]] quotes from the booklet of ''[[The Spoken Word: British Writers]]'': "<nowiki>[</nowiki>The [[1965 BBC Interview]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> was recorded for the BBC Sound Archive and was not transmitted".<ref>http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-bbc-collection-includes-tolkien.html - New BBC collection includes Tolkien recording </ref>
**(3) ''Tolkienbooks.net: An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography'' says that the interview in Minas Tirith Evening-Star Vol.8, No.2, is "a transcription of an interview with Tolkien by Denys Gueroult in January 1965. First broadcast in January 1971 as part of the BBC Radio 4 book review programme Now Read On."<ref>http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=61285 - Minas Tirith Evening Star </ref>
**(4) [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] write in ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Chronology'' that the recording of the [[1965 BBC Interview]] was "to be placed in the BBC's Recorded Programmes Permanent Library".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 627</ref> Concerning the [[1964 BBC Interview]], they write that it was "intended to be a trial run for an official interview to be placed in the BBC's Sound Archives".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 625</ref>
