In 1981 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a dramatisation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s '''''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''''' in 26 half-hour stereo instalments.

It followed [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|a previous 12-part BBC Radio version]] from 1955 and 1956, of which no recordings are known to have survived.

==Broadcast history==

Each of the original 26 episodes received two broadcasts per week - standard practice for many BBC radio serials even today. The first broadcast of Episode 2 was blacked out across a large part of south east England because of a transmitter failure (a very rare occurrence even then).


The 26-part series was subsequently edited into 13 hour-long episodes, restoring some dialogue originally cut for timing (since each hour-long episode is actually around 57 minutes, as opposed to 54 minutes for two half-hour episodes), rearranging some scenes for dramatic impact and adding linking narration and music cues. It was broadcast in 13 episodes in [[1982]].

The re-edited version was released on both cassette tape and CD sets which also included the soundtrack album (noticeably taken from a vinyl copy).

A soundtrack album featuring a completely re-recorded and in some cases expanded, suite of [[Stephen Oliver]]'s music was released in 1981.

==Differences from the book==

The script by [[Brian Sibley]] and [[Michael Bakewell]] attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original novels, but there are some errors and alterations. They include:

*At one point, [[Minas Anor]] and [[Minas Tirith]] are referred to as though they were separate cities; these are merely alternate names for the same city.

*Part of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]] sequence is described in song by an opera-style vocalist rather than acted, which may distance some listeners from the action. Others may find the kinship between the sequence and Eddic style of storytelling interesting.

*The journey through [[Drúadan Forest]] and the subsequent alliance with [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]]'s wild men, or "woses" is removed from the radio drama.

*[[Quickbeam]] the Ent does not appear in the story.

*[[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] does not appear in the story.

*The radio serial omits the sequence in the book in which the hobbits visit with [[Tom Bombadil]]. However, in doing so, the Hobbits are never shown to receive their [[Barrow-blade|swords]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], which are enchanted with spells that are proof against the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]]. Sibley acknowledges this later, when Merry stabs him during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Instead of being weakened as in the book, he merely says Merry stings like a gnat.

==Re-release in 2002==
In 2002, to coincide with the release of Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], the BBC reissued the series in three sets corresponding to the three original volumes (''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'').

This version omitted the original episode divisions, and included a new opening and closing narration for the first two sets, and an opening narration only for the last, recorded by Ian Holm in character as Frodo Baggins - Frodo's narrations deal with his efforts to write his historical account of the War of the Ring in the [[Red Book]], as well as his own personal reflections and musings on the story's events.

The re-edited version also included some additional music cues, which had to be taken from the soundtrack album because the original master tapes for the series music had been lost.

The soundtrack, now digitally remastered, was also included with ''The Return of the King'' set, with a demo of John Le Mesurier singing ''[[Bilbo's Last Song]]'' included as a bonus track. 

The 13-episode series was also rerun on Radio 4 in 2002.
