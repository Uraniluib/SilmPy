==Summary==
Tolkien was particularly interested in Austinâ€™s remarks about Galadriel.  He thought it was true that her character owed much to Christian and Catholic teaching and imagination about Mary, but he pointed out that Galadriel was actually a penitent.  She was a rebel leader against the [[Valar]] (angelic guardians) and proudly refused forgiveness or permission to return at the end of the [[First Age]].  Eventually she was pardoned for resisting the temptation to take [[the One Ring|the Ring]] for herself.

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
As [[Christopher Tolkien]] explained in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', the story of Galadriel underwent continual refashionings.  The version above is but one variation.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>
