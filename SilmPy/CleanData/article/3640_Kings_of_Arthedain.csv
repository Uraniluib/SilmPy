The '''Kings of Arthedain''' were the hereditary rulers of [[Arthedain]], one of the three successor kingdoms of [[Arnor]] after its division in {{TA|861}}.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> 

They were descended from [[Amlaith]], the eldest son of [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] the last [[King of Arnor]].<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> Following the destruction of the other two northern [[Dúnedain]] kingdoms, [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], the kings of Arthedain claimed the title King of Arnor.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> Practically speaking, however, their power was limited to the land of Arthedain which gradually diminished over the course of their seven hundred-year struggle with [[Angmar]].

Angmar finally triumphed over Arthedain in {{TA|1974}} with the destruction of [[Fornost]]. The son of the last king, [[Arvedui]], chose not to claim the kingship and instead became the first [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] in {{TA|1976}}.<ref name="TA"/>

Beginning with [[Argeleb I]] onwards to the Chieftains of the Dúnedain, their names included the [[Elvish]] prefix ''Ar(an)-'' indicating loyal claim to the whole Arnor, after the lines of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] failed.<ref>{{App|North}}, note 4</ref>
