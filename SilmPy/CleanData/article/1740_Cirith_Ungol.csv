'''Cirith Ungol''' was located on the north shoulder of the '''Morgul Pass'''. These two passes through the western mountains of [[Mordor]] were the only way towards the land from the west.

Cirith Ungol was guarded by the '''[[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]''', built by the Men of [[Gondor]] after the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was fought. 

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] were led up the '''[[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]''' to this pass by [[Gollum]] to the lair of the giant spider [[Shelob]], who dwelt there.

It is not known whether the pass and the tower were called Cirith Ungol when the Men of Gondor held it.
