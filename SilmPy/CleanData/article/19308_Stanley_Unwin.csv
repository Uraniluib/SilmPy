Sir '''Stanley Unwin''' ([[19 December]] [[1884]] â€“ [[13 October]] [[1968]]) was a British publisher who co-founded the [[Allen and Unwin|George Allen and Unwin]] house on [[4 August]] [[1914]]. This published serious and sometimes controversial authors like Bertrand Russell and Mahatma Gandhi.

In [[1936]] [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] submitted ''[[The Hobbit]]'' for publication, and Unwin paid his ten-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] a few pence to write a report on the manuscript. Rayner's favourable response prompted Unwin to publish the book. Once the book became a success Unwin asked Tolkien for a sequel, which eventually became ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
