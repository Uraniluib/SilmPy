'''Tolkiens Følge''' was a short-lived Tolkien society in Denmark. The Society was founded by [[Jeppe Juul]] in [[wikipedia:Roskilde|Roskilde]] on [[22 September|September 22]], [[1992]]. The society published a single issue of its bulletin ''[[Ringen (publication)|Ringen]]''.

"Tolkiens Følge" was inspired by the Swedish Tolkien Societies: the members dressed up in medieval costumes and took an alias from the universe created by Tolkien.

The society did not manage to arrange much events, and in the summer of [[1993]] Tolkiens Følge merged with [[Imladris, Danmarks Tolkienforening|Danmarks Tolkienforening]].<ref>[[Lars-Terje Lysemose]], "[http://www.imladris.dk/?id=16&show=93 Historien om Imladris - Danmarks Tolkienforening (Den lange udgave)]" ("The History of Imladris, the Tolkien Society of Denmark (The Long Story)", online article, as of July 22, 2010</ref>
