'''Roses''' are flowering plants with large, showy blossoms and (often) prickly stems that were found in many places throughout [[Middle-earth]].
 
In [[Gondolin]] there was a roadway called the [[Alley of Roses]], one of the most beautiful places in the city.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 183</ref>
 
In [[the Shire]] it was common to bestow flower names upon girls<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> and many maidens bore the name "Rose" – [[Rosa Baggins]]<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>, [[Rose (daughter of Holman)|Rose]] (the daughter of [[Holman the greenhanded]]), [[Rose Cotton]], [[Rose Gardner]], and [[Primrose Gardner]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref> Given the stay-at-home nature of [[Hobbits]]<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> their familiarity with roses certainly indicates the cultivation of these flowers in their homeland.
 
Roses could be found far to the south of the Shire. In [[Ithilien]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] encountered [[Eglantine]], a type of rose<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref> (one Hobbit, [[Eglantine Banks]],<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> was named after this flower, indicating that this variety of rose also grew in the Shire).  When [[Aragorn]] steeped [[athelas]] in hot water in the [[Houses of Healing]], [[Ioreth]] claimed that the fragrance reminded her of the roses in [[Imloth Melui]], a valley in [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref>
