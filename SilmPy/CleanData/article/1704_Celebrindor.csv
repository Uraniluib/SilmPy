'''Celebrindor''' ({{TA|1062}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1272}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 210) was the fifth [[King of Arthedain]].

==History==
Celebrindor was the son of [[Celepharn]], and came to the throne of [[Arthedain]] upon his father's death in {{TA|1191|n}}.<ref name="North"/> His reign as king was uneventful, as relations between the other realms of [[Arnor]] - [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] - were good, and no evil threatened the realm yet - it was after Celebrindor's death that [[Angmar]] started to pose a threat to the peoples of Arnor.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Celebrindor died in 1272 after ruling the Northern Kingdom for eighty-one years. He was succeeded by his son [[Malvegil]] upon his death.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
The etymology of Celebrindor's name is uncertain. The most likely meaning is "silverlike lord" from ''[[celebrin]]'' "silver-like (adjective)" and ''[[taur]]'', which means among other things "lord".
