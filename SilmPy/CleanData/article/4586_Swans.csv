<small>"''...the proudest of all these birds were the swans''"<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|V}}, p. 124</ref></small>

'''Swans''' were waterfowl of either black or white color,<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref> though usually the latter. It said that swans were especially abundant in the ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' ([[Swanfleet]]), a wetland region in [[Eriador]].<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, "Appendix D: The Port of Lond Daer" (discussion of the name ''Glanduin'')</ref>
==Swans and the [[Free peoples]]==
The swan was an important bird in the tales of the [[Elder Days]]. The [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Ossë]] sent "''many strong-winged swans''" to draw the ships of the [[Teleri]] over [[Belegaer]] to [[Aman]] without help of the winds. The Teleri (later being called by the epithet the ''Swanherds'')<ref>{{MR|P3I3}} (§30)</ref> thus especially came to revere swans, and named their city [[Alqualondë]] (the Swanhaven) and built their [[Swan-ships|ships in swan-form]].<ref>{{S|5}}</ref><ref>{{SM|Q3}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}</ref>

Ossë's master [[Ulmo]], the [[Valar|Vala]], sent seven great swans to guide [[Tuor]] to [[Vinyamar]], where he found a shield which had "''an emblem of a white swan's wing''". Tuor already loved these birds, having been fostered at Mithrim, where swans seem to have been plentiful (and Tuor's foster-father, [[Annael]] and his folk, had the swan as a symbol). Departing from Vinyamar, Ulmo's seven swans approached Tuor and offered him one feather each, which Tuor set in the crest of his helm.<ref>{{S|23}}</ref><ref>{{UT|1}}</ref>

The Teleri were not alone in using the swan-form in ship-building: the prow of [[Eärendil]]'s ship [[Vingilótë]] "''was fashioned like a swan''", <ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, "[[Song of Eärendil]]"</ref> and the Elves of [[Lothlórien]] made a [[Swan-ships|Swan-ship]], so well crafted that it resembled a real, giant swan.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> 

In the [[Third Age]], the symbol of the Swan-knights of [[Dol Amroth]] was a banner, silver upon blue, bearing a "''token of the Ship and the Silver Swan''", and their mariners used swan-prowed ships.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>

==Names==

In [[Sindarin]], the name for "swan" was ''[[alph]]'' (pl. ''eilph''), as in [[Nîn-in-Eilph]]. The [[Quenya]] [[Wikipedia:Cognate|cognate]] was ''[[alqua]]'', as in [[Alqualondë]], and the [[Telerin]] was ''[[alpa]]''.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, "Appendix D: The Port of Lond Daer" (Note to discussion of the name ''Glanduin'')</ref>

In Tolkien's early tongues [[Ilkorin]] and [[Danian]], the name for "swan" was ''alch'' and ''ealc'', respectively.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}} (entry [[ÁLAK|ÁLAK-]])</ref> Other early conceptions include [[Gnomish]] ''alfa'' or ''alfuil'' and [[Qenya]] ''alqe''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 18-19</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==

A late manuscript concerning [[Númenor]] tells about the legendary great [[Swans of Gorbelgod]].<ref>{{PM|XVII}}, p. 426</ref>

In an early versions of the [[Legendarium]], more details about the use of swans in symbolism and crafting are given:
*Reminding of the Elven Swan-ships, [[Aulë]] seems to have been the first to make "''great vessels like to the bodies of swans''".<ref name=LT1/>
*It is also said [[Tuor]] used a "''boat with a prow fashioned like to the neck of a swan''" on [[Lake Mithrim]], and that Ulmo apparently sent three swans to guide him out of Mithrim (much reminding of the later device of the "seven swans"). Later, the wing of a white swan become the symbol for Tuor and his company ([[House of the Wing]]) in [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>
*''See also [[House of the Swan]]''

==Inspiration==

In a poem about [[Tom Bombadil]], it is said that "''he wore in his tall hat a swan-wing feather''".<ref>{{AB|Tom}}</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained in a letter to [[Pauline Baynes]]  that the swan, (traditionally the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan#Role_in_culture property of the King]), indicated a "''special friendship with Tom''", the swans being among the creatures "''who looked for the return of their rightful Lord, the true King''".<ref>{{L|240}}</ref> Perhaps this perceived nobility of the swans explains why Tolkien used the bird as a symbol for the princely line of Dol Amroth, and why the swans were described as allies of the [[Ainur]] and [[Elves]].

A glimpse of Tolkien's childhood experience of swans has also been described: 

{{quote|...they [Ronald and Hilary] would scamper away from the yard, and run round to a place behind the mill [at [[Sarehole]]] where there was a silent pool with swans swimming on it.|[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''

:''Black Swans'' are conceived as quite ill-meaning creatures "''known to mob and overturn boats''", and being larger than normal swans. Another type of swans, the ''Pied Swans'' (given the name ''Elph Tithen'' in Sindarin), are described as "''creamy white in color, liberally splotched and speckled with black and grey''", and said to be intelligent and friendly to travellers.<ref>{{ICE|8005}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8020}}</ref>
