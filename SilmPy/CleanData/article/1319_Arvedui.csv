'''Arvedui''' ({{TA|1864}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 195</ref> – {{TA|1975|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 111) was the fifteenth, and last, king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Araphant]], upon his death in 1964.

==History==
===Birth and Early Life===
Arvedui's name meant "Last King" in [[Sindarin]], and he was named so due to a prophecy by [[Malbeth|Malbeth the Seer]] at Arvedui's birth spoken to his father, [[Araphant]]: {{quote|Arvedui you shall call him, for he will be the last in Arthedain. Though a choice will come to the Dúnedain, and if they take the one that seems less hopeful, then your son will change his name and become king of a great realm. If not, then much sorrow and many lives of men shall pass, until the Dúnedain arise and are united again.|[[Malbeth]]<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>}}

Arvedui married [[Fíriel]], the daughter of the king of [[Gondor]], [[Ondoher]], in {{TA|1940|n}}, securing the link between Gondor and Arthedain after years of estrangement. Four years later, Ondoher was killed in a battle with the [[Wainriders]], and died without a male heir. Arvedui sent messages to Gondor claiming the kingship of Gondor as a descendent of [[Isildur]] and as the husband of [[Fíriel]], who, under [[Law of Succession in Númenor|old Númenórean law]], should have become the first ruling queen. In {{TA|1945|n}} the [[Council of Gondor]], persuaded by the Steward [[Pelendur]], voted against Arvedui's claim in favour of [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] - the distant relative of the king and the victorious general in the war on the Wainriders.<ref name="Gondor"/>

===Life as King===

[[File:Steamey - Arvedui.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''Arvedui'']]
When Arvedui became king in {{TA|1964|n}}, the kingdom was already in a bad state, struggling to hold back the forces of [[Angmar]]. In {{TA|1974|n}} the [[Witch-king]] descended from the north, capturing [[Fornost]] and pushing most of the [[Dúnedain]] over the [[Lhûn|Lune]]. Arvedui and his men, rescued several heirlooms of Arnor such as the [[Ring of Barahir]] and ''[[palantíri]]'' of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]] and [[Annúminas]]. They held out on the [[North Downs]] but fled north and hid in old [[Dwarf|dwarven]] mines in the [[Blue Mountains]] before being forced to seek the aid of the [[Lossoth]] in the Ice-bay of [[Forochel]] due to hunger.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

The snowmen were unmoved by the Arnorians's jewels but helped the gaunt king and his men out of pity and out of fear of their weapons, giving them food and building them snow-huts.  Arvedui and his men had to stay there as their horses had perished, and kept a fire constantly alight waiting for help. That winter was especially long and the ices persisted. In {{TA|1975|n}}, when [[Círdan]] heard from Arvedui's son, [[Aranarth]], of his plight, he sent a ship to Forochel to find him.  When the ship arrived in March of that year, the ice-men were afraid for no ship had been seen in those water in living memory, and the leader of the snowmen counselled Arvedui:{{quote|Do not mount on this sea-monster! If they have them, let the seamen bring us food and other things that we need, and you may stay here till the Witch-king goes home. For in summer his power wanes; but now his breath is deadly, and his cold arm is long.|Chief of the Lossoth<ref name="Eriador"/>}}
However, Arvedui did not heed their advice and gave them his ring, the [[Ring of Barahir]], as a token of his thanks. When the ship set sail a great wind came from the north and the hull of the ship was broken on some ice, thus the last king of Arthedain died, and with him the two ''[[palantíri]]'' were lost.<ref name="Eriador"/>

===After Arvedui's Death===
In {{TA|1973|n}}, Gondor had received word from Arthedain of their difficulties, and not forgetting their ancient kinship, [[Eärnil II]], king of Gondor, sent as great a fleet as he could spare captained by his son [[Eärnur]]. By the time the fleet arrived, Arthedain was already defeated, and Arvedui had already perished. 

However, in order to finally defeat this evil, Eärnur, Círdan and [[Glorfindel]] captained a host from Gondor, [[Lindon]] and [[Rivendell]] and marched across Eriador in such a great force that Angmar was utterly defeated without a single orc from that realm left to the west of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

Despite the eventual victory over Angmar, Arnor was utterly defeated, and the Dúnedain of the North were a scattered and [[Rangers of the North|wandering people]] of which there were few. The line of kings continued, however, in [[Aranarth]] who took the title of [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] all the way down to [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]]; and when Aragorn claimed the throne of Gondor he did so as both the heir of Isildur and Anárion due to the fact he was descended from Fíriel - a claim none of the heirs of Arvedui forgot.

As such, Malbeth's prophecy proved true, for Arvedui was indeed the last King of Arthedain; likewise, the last king of Gondor was Eärnur who was killed by the Witch-king. There would not be another king in the north until [[Aragorn|Elessar]] reunited the thrones of Gondor and Arnor in the [[Reunited Kingdom]].

== Etymology ==
Arvedui's name is [[Sindarin]] for "Last King" from ''[[ar]]'' meaning "royal, king", and ''[[medui]]'' (becoming [[Lenition|lenited]] to ''vedui'') meaning "last".

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':''' 
:Arvedui appears in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]'', during the Siege of Fornost in the Angmar-campaign. After Angmar's forces reach the second wall, he leads a sortie, but is killed.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:In his last moments, Arvedui despaired and cursed himself for his pride in ignoring the warning of the [[Lossoth]]. As of the [[War of the Ring]], his shade still lingered in the wreck of his ship in the ice near the western coast of the [[Icebay of Forochel|Icebay]]. At his request, the player recovered a book of heraldry that had been left in the [[Dwarf]]-mines he had hidden in, and delivered the book to the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] "Lothrandir".<ref>{{VGC|SAXIII}}</ref>
