{{Blockquote|[In the letter, Tolkien is] apologising for his lack of reply and describing himself as "a much harassed man". He notes that since publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' "it was discovered how I had wasted my time for the last many years", stating his "intention of publishing the legends of the Beginning and the [[First Age|First]] and [[Second Age]]", that "co-ordinating the large mass of written material" will be "a lot of work" and that "with luck (which has not notably attended me since [[1956]]) they may appear in [[1960]]".|<ref name=Sothebys/>}}
