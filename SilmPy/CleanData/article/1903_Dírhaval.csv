'''Dírhaval''' or '''Dírhavel''' was a [[Men|Man]] of the [[House of Hador]] who lived among the exiles and refugees at the [[Havens of Sirion]] during the closing century of the [[First Age]], at the time of [[Eärendil]]. 
==History==
Dírhaval was known as a poet, though he only produced a single poem. Drawing on the knowledge and memories of the people of [[Doriath]], [[Dor-lómin]], and other lands of [[Beleriand]] that were gathered at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], he wrote  ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' ("Tale of the Children of Húrin"), telling the story of [[Morgoth]]'s curse on [[Húrin]]'s children [[Túrin]] and [[Nienor]]. It was written in [[Sindarin]], and the longest of all the lays to come out of Beleriand. 

Dírhaval did not write other poems or lays, as the [[Silmaril]] [[Quest for the Silmaril|captured]] by [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] was in the keeping of [[Elwing]]. The [[Sons of Fëanor]] launched an attack on the exiles in the Havens of Sirion to claim it. Dírhaval was one of those who fell in the [[Third Kinslaying]].<ref name=WJII/>
