'''Oromë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] and one of the [[Aratar]], also known as the ''Huntsman of the Valar'' and the ''Great Rider''.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> 
==Attributes==
Oromë delights in hunting monsters and evil creatures, riding on his steed [[Nahar]] and blowing his great horn [[Valaróma]]. He loves [[horses]] and [[dogs|hounds]] as well as all trees and forests. In [[Yavanna]]'s woods in [[Valinor]] he trains his folk and beasts for hunting.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

He was the brother of [[Nessa]] and the husband of [[Vána]].<ref name=vala/>
==History==
During the [[Years of the Trees]], after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in [[Aman]], Oromë was the last who came to Valinor, and even then he still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion.<ref name=vala/> He visited [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], hunting monsters and fell creatures and the shadows fled temporarily until he left.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref>

Thus, he was responsible for finding the [[Elves]] when they awoke at [[Cuiviénen]], and was the first to name them the [[Eldar]]. Seeking to ensure their safety, Oromë accompanied the Elves from Cuiviénen to Beleriand. Being a powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against [[Morgoth]].

Because Oromë was the only Vala who travelled in [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Elder Days]], it was believed, even during the [[Third Age]] that the wild [[cows|oxen]] found near the [[Sea of Rhun]] descended from his [[Kine of Araw|Kine]].<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> 

'''''Béma''''' was the name used by the [[Northmen]] for Oromë. As the great huntsman and horseman of the Valar, he and his steed Nahar were known to the horse-loving people of [[Rohan]], who claimed that their great horses, the [[Mearas]], had ancestors brought out of [[Aman|the West]] by Béma himself.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Oromë'' is said to be derived from his [[Valarin]] name '''''Arōmēz'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref> 

His name is translated as "Horn-blowing" and "Sound of Horns".<ref>{{PE|21}}, pp. 82, 85</ref>

'''''Araw''''' ({{IPA|[ˈaraʊ]}}) was the [[Sindarin]] form of the name of the Oromë.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 96</ref><ref>{{VT|39a}}, p. 10</ref>

'''''Tauron''''' was an epithet used by the [[Sindar]] for Oromë.<ref name=Index>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=PM/> In the ''[[Valaquenta]]'', ''Tauron'' is translated as "Lord of Forests".<ref name=Index/> Another translation is "The Forester".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=PM>{{PM|XI}}, p. 358 (note 21)</ref> The language, to which the name pertains, remains non-explicit in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s texts:
#[[Quenya]] word? The root of the word could be ''[[taure]]'' ("great wood") plus the ending ''[[-on]]''. The name would thus have the sense "One of forests".<ref>Suggestion by [[User:Sage]]</ref>
#[[Sindarin]] word? This would be suggested by its usage among the Sindar and by the [[Noldorin]] form it replaced (see below).

Tolkien used at least two earlier forms of the by-name ''Tauron'':
#''Tavros'' - the form ''Tauros'' replaced - used in such early texts as the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]''.<ref>{{HM|LB}}, ''passim''</ref> The name is [[Noldorin|Gnomish]], defined as "Chief wood fay 'the Blue Spirit of the Woods'".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 69</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 267</ref><ref group="note">The form ''Tavros'' cited here from the ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 11|Gnomish Lexicon]]'', is defined as a "proper name". The form ''tavros'' (with a minuscule ''t'') is defined as "forest, wooded land".</ref>
#''Tauros'' - the form ''Tauron'' replaced - is a [[Noldorin]] word defined in the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' as meaning "Forest-Dread" ([[Sundocarme|roots]] [[TAW|TÁWAR]] + [[GOS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 391</ref>

The name ''Béma'' is from the [[Rohirric|tongue of Rohan]] ([[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was inspired by the [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:beme|béme]]'' "trumpet").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 153</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Oromë is referred to as ''Wáðfréa'' "Huntinglord", ''Huntena  fréa'' "Hunting  Lord and Lord of  Hunters" and ''Wealdafréa'' "Lord of Forests". The name ''Béaming'' is a translation of Q. ''Aldaron''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

In the earliest form of the [[legendarium|mythology]], Oromë was described as the son of [[Aulë]] and [[Yavanna]] whilst having the daughter [[Nielíqui]] with [[Vána]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, p. 288</ref>
