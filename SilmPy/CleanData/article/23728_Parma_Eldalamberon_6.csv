'''''Parma Eldalamberon''''' '''6''' is the sixth issue of ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'', and the first after its revival by [[Christopher Gilson]]. John Closson contributed with the front cover calligraphy, and Silas Andrews with interior artwork.

The issue includes a letter from [[Rhona Beare]] that reports brief notes made on a draft version of [[Thr贸r's Map]].  These notes consist of the phrase "Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast" in [[Noldorin]] and [[Old English]] - Rhone Beare copied the notes from the map when it was on display in an exhibition of "Cartographic Curiosities" at The British Museum. The draft version of Thr贸r's Map can be seen in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'' (1995) - figure 85.<ref>''An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography'' at Tolkienbooks.net</ref>
