==Hobbit Summary==

=== A Road through the Dark ===

The [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] player's good friend [[Celandine Brandybuck]] sent a letter to the player from [[Archet]] mentioning that there are [[Blackwolds|brigands]] in the area. The player writes back to her urging her to come back to [[Tuckborough]], but the player has not heard back from her. Worried, the Hobbit player talks to Postman [[Took Family|Took]] who informs that player that letters to Archet cannot be delivered because it has been besieged by ruffians. Postman Took gives the letter back to the player and says that the Hobbit player could get help delivering it from the Hobbit postmen in [[Buckland]].

When the Hobbit player comes to [[Stock]] to begin the journey to Buckland the player spots [[Bounder]] [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] shaking in fear as a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] gallops off. Boffin says that the strange rider was looking for Baggins. He brings the Hobbit player to the leaf-farm of Old Odo where they can lock themselves inside and hide, defeating spiders along the way. When Boffin tries to open the gate to the farm the key breaks. Then he and the Hobbit player decide to travel to [[Woodhall]] but on their way to that village they overhear the conservation between a Black Riders and a group of brigands. The Black Rider spots them, but is stopped from slaying the two Hobbits by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]].

Gildor informs the Hobbit player that his companion the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]] was heading to Archet to investigate the [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] brigands there. He suggests the player to travel with him for safety.

==Man Summary==

=== Jailbreak ===


The [[Men|Man]] player wakes up in a [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] cell by the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]]. He informs the player that he learned from [[Jon Brackenbrook]] that [[Calder Cob]] is working for the Blackwold and captured two visiting Hobbits: [[Celandine Brandybuck]] and [[Mundo Sackville-Baggins]]. He would like the Man player's help looking for them.

The player finds Celandine inside a holding pen near the entrance to the jail. After slaying the Blackwolds, Celandine tells them that Mundo is being held captive in the courtyard. Celandine sets fire to the jail trying to get the Blackwold's attention so they can rescue him. As they attempt to put out the flames, the two of them enter the courtyard and find Mundo tied to a pole. 

After they free Mundo of his bounds a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] approaches, but is blocked by the flames of the fire from getting the Hobbits. Amdir shows and attempts to drive the Black Rider off. He succeeds, but is gravely wounded in the process. Celandine suggestions taking him to [[Archet]] to get help mending his wounds.

==Merger Summary==

=== Amdir's Request ===

The next morning in [[Archet]], [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Kate Henseed|Kate Henseed]], a female [[Men|Man]], informs the player that [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]] was looking for the player. The player finds him outside [[The Mad Badger Inn]] who tells the player that he was wounded by the Black Rider and fears that he is poisoned. He asks the player to speak to [[Captain Brackenbrook]], the Man in charge of Archet's garrison and tell him that his son's suspicions at the Blackwolds' camp were correct. [[Calder Cob]] a member of the garison is a traitor and in league with the Blackwolds. He fears that he wouldn't believe if they news came from him, since the Men of Bree-land do not trust the Rangers.

=== Captain Brackenbrook ===

The Captain doesn't believe the player's tale of Calder, since he was the one that captured the former leader of the Blackwolds, [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Otto the Brigand|Otto]]. The Captain suggests that if the player wishes to help Archet that there are wolves that plague the farmers and need to be slain.

=== Honing your Skills ===

The player informs Amdir that the Captain did not believe the player's story. He suggests that you hone your skills and then prove your worth to the Captain by helping [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Dirk Mudbrick|Dirk Mudbrick]].

=== Seeing the Defence ===

After slaying some wolves for the farmer Dirk Mudbrick, he tells the player that he notices that the Blackwolds seemed a bit stronger. He suggests that you find the Blackwold spies and find out what they are up to. 

=== The Spies ===

The player finds and slays a spy and finds a note on him for Calder from [[Éogan]] that says that they will attack Archet from the west and burn it to the ground as the Men of Archet have done to their camp. The player brings the note to Dirk who tells the player to bring to the Captain as quickly as possible. 

=== The Captain's Son ===

When the Captain reads the note he is saddened that he didn't believe his own son, [[Jon Brackenbrook]]. He orders his guards to find Calder and imprison him. The Captain asks the player to go speak with Jon in the Hunter's Lodge and ask for his assistance with the [[Blackwolds]]. The player does find Jon at the lodge.

=== The Blackwold's Roost ===

Jon suggests that the player go to the encampment of Blackwolds in the south and provide a distraction to give the guards of Archet time to prepare their defenses. The player goes to the encampment, but finds only a handful of the Blackwolds. After slaying a few of them, the player goes back to Jon where they learn that [[Éogan]] and the rest of the Blackwolds are already making their attack on Archet. 

=== The Assault on Archet ===

The Blackwolds are making their attack on Archet from the south. Jon suggests taking the path to the east into the city. The player, Jon and the rest of the hunters make their way from the east into Archet. The player finds that Archet is ablaze and its citizens are running out in panic. 

The player comes to the jail where they can hear [[Calder Cob]] fighting with the jailor [[Ned Pruner]]. His wife, [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Peg Pruner|Peg Pruner]] is franticly trying to find the key to the locked door, but once she finds the key its too late. Calder fleed and Ned lays on the floor close to death. His wife kneels over him sobbing as Ned tells the player he must find [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]] at the Mad Badger Inn and help him. With his last breath he mutters, "That hobbit [[Éogan]] wants... and the Captain. I... I saw Éogan... go after 'em! Ye must save 'em...!"

The player does find Amdir at the inn. The player also sees Éogan beyond the flames with some hobbits held captive. The player rushes to a nearby well to draw water to douse the flames. With the path safe, the player and Amdir rush to the Blackwolds, but suddenly Amdir collapses, holding the wound the Nazgúl's morgul-knife made. Otto, freed from the prison by the [[Blackwolds]], takes Amdír as prisoner while the player meets Éogan in combat.

The player manages to defeat Éogan and the rest of his company. The player helps free the hobbits of their bounds. One of them, [[Mundo Sackville-Baggins]], informs the player that Éogan thought he had some sort of treasure that he brought back when helping the dwarves. He informs the player that they had the wrong Baggins. Suddenly, Éogan gets up and flees after learning the truth that he wasn't the hobbit he was looking for. The player does not pursue after him, instead electing to take care the hobbits. 
[[Celandine Brandybuck]] thanks the player for helping him and Mundo. The two of them head off back to [[the Shire]].

The following day the fire is under control, but half of Archet is lost. The player learns from [[Jon Brackenbrook]] that his father died in the attack last night. Although he lost his father, Jon thanks the player for saving what they could of Archet.
