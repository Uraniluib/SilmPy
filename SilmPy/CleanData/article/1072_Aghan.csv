'''Aghan''' was one of the [[Drúedain]] who lived in the region of the [[Forest of Brethil]] during the [[First Age]]. He was skilled in the healing of wounds, and had special knowledge of the venoms used by [[Orcs]]. 

At a time of Orc-raids in the woods of [[Brethil]], he took to watching the home of his friend [[Barach]] of the [[House of Haleth|Folk of Haleth]]. According to the tale of ''[[The Faithful Stone]]'', he was called away from Barach's house for some days to help his injured kin, and left behind a "watch-stone": a figure carved in the shape of a [[Drúedain|Drúadan]]. While he was away, Barach's house was attacked by Orcs who attempted to set it ablaze, but they were beaten off by a mysterious [[Drúedain|Drûg]]. 

Barach afterwards discovered that it was the watch-stone itself that had somehow come to life and saved his family from the Orcs, though it had been badly burned and broken in putting out the flames. Because of the power Aghan had put into the stone, he too suffered some of these burns, though they were already healing when he returned to Barach's house the following day.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>
