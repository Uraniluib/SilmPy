==Other versions of the legendarium==
Tolkien experimented with the concept that ROK was a word related to fear and subsequently to Orcs. The origin of the root ROK as 'fear' was the horseman emissary of Melkor who abducted Elves from [[Cuiviénen]]. However, later Orcs and fear were related to a different root, [[ÓROK]] and [[RUKU]].{{fact}}
