}}'''Narmacil II''' ({{TA|1684}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|1856|n}},<ref name="south">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 172 years)was the twenty-ninth [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]].  Narmacil was the son and successor to [[Telumehtar Umbardacil]] and brother of [[Arciryas]].<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
During Narmacil's reign a new confederacy of many peoples called the [[Wainriders]] appeared from the East.  Encouraged by emissaries from [[Sauron]] they suddenly assaulted [[Gondor]].<ref name="Gondor"/>  Narmacil brought a great army into the plains south of [[Mirkwood]] and gathered what remnants of the [[Northmen]] he could to meet the threat.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>  However, these new enemies were stronger and better armed than before, traveling in great wains with warriors mounted in chariots.  In the [[Battle of the Plains]] Narmacil was slain north-east of the [[Morannon]].  Thereafter the people of southern and eastern [[Rhovanion]] were enslaved while the border of Gondor was withdrawn to the [[Anduin]].<ref name="Gondor"/>
