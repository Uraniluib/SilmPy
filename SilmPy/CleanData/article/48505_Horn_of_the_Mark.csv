The '''Horn of the Mark''' was a silver horn, made by the [[Dwarves]]. It was among their treasure that the [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] [[Scatha]] took from them.<ref name=partings>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> 

When [[Fram]] killed [[Scatha]], his hoard became a matter of dispute between the [[Éothéod]] and the Dwarves.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> Nonetheless the Horn was taken by the [[Éothéod]] and apparently it became a heirloom of the [[House of Eorl]] even when they settled [[Rohan]].

Centuries later, at the end of the [[War of the Ring]], Lady [[Éowyn]] gave the Horn to [[Holdwine]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] as a farewell gift for his services to Rohan.<ref name=partings/>

On their return to [[the Shire]], Merry used the Horn to sound the [[Horn-call of Buckland]] on [[2 November]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> rousing the Shire-folk against the [[Ruffians]] who had taken control of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

In commemoration of those events and the liberation of the Shire, the Horn was sounded ceremonially every year at sundown on 2 November in [[Buckland]], commencing celebrations with bonfires and feasts.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
