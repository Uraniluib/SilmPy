'''Lagduf''' (late [[Third Age]]) was an [[Orcs|Orc]] soldier who served under [[Shagrat]] in the garrison of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], a riot broke out in the Tower with a rival band of orcs from [[Minas Morgul]]. Lagduf attempted to escape with another Orc named [[Muzgash]], but they were both shot as they ran from the fortress.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''
: Though unidentified, a trio of Uruk-hai are encountered by Samwise Gamgee on the stairs of the tower after the battle. Since only one Uruk ([[Snaga (Orc of Mordor)|Snaga]]) was encountered by Sam on the stairs in the novel, it is likely that the other two are meant to be Lagduf and [[Muzgash]].
