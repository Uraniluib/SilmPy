The '''River Narog''' was the chief river of West [[Beleriand]], the largest tributary of River [[Sirion]].

The Narog was eighty leagues in length.<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>  It rose from the '''[[Pools of Ivrin]]''' in the [[Ered Wethrin]], flowed south and then southeast, flowing through a gorge in a series of rapids where it crossed the hills of the [[Andram]] or Long Wall, finally meeting Sirion in the Land of Willows [[Nan-tathren]], not far above the Mouths of Sirion.  Narog's tributaries were the '''River [[Ginglith]]''' in the north and the '''River [[Ringwil]]''' in the '''[[Taur-en-Faroth]]'''.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

Into its western bank, just south of where Ringwil rushed into Narog, was carved the city of [[Nargothrond]], stronghold of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]].<ref name="Beleriand"/>

== Etymology ==
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], the river's name was stated to mean "rushing, violent".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> However, in a later writing by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], the [[Sindarin]] name ''Narog'' was given two possible [[Khuzdul]] origins: ''[[Nar√¢g]]'' and ''[[naruka]]'', both of unknown meaning.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 37, 47</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Narog is referred as ''Hlyda'' "Loudy". The Elves of Nargothrond were named Hlydingas.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
