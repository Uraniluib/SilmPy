== History ==
The original name of ''Súlë'' was ''þúlë'' and in Quenya it had the value '''TH''' or '''þ'''. The alteration of its value occurred among the [[Noldor]] while in [[Valinor]].  The change angered [[Fëanor]] for he felt it was an insult to change the pronunciation of the [[Mother-name|mother-name]] of his mother [[Míriel]], which was ''[[þerindë]]''.<ref group="note">For more about this politicized linguistic debate, see [[The Shibboleth of Fëanor#The case of the Quenya change of þ > s|The Shibboleth of Fëanor]].</ref>  However, the mutation of '''þ''' to '''S''' continued and eventually this letter was renamed ''Súlë'' and in Quenya only has the value '''S''' (and is only used instead of letters 29 or 30 when the original sound in a word was "þ").<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word derives from the [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[THŪ]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, THŪ-</ref>
