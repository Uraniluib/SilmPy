'''Havens of the [[Falas]]''' (called '''Havens of Círdan''' by [[Voronwë]]<ref>{{UT|1}}, p. 32.</ref>) were the two great walled [[Elves|Elven]] cities: '''[[Eglarest]]''' at the mouth of the River [[Nenning]], and to the north '''[[Brithombar]]''' at the mouth of the River [[Brithon]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> Built on the western shores of the Falas, the Havens were the realm of [[Círdan]] the Shipwright and his people, the [[Falathrim]], who were considered [[Sindar]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>

The Havens were besieged during the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], but during the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] the [[Orcs]] that besieged the cities turned north to fight the [[Noldor]] and were all slain.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>  When [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] established himself in [[Nargothrond]] his rule extended over all of [[West Beleriand]] excepts for the coasts, which continued to be ruled by Círdan, Felagund's ally. Thanks to the alliance between the [[Falathrim]] and the [[Elves of Nargothrond]], the Havens were built as fair towns and fortified behind great walls.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

The Havens of the Falas held out during the later [[Battles of Beleriand]] until they were finally destroyed in {{FA|473}},<ref>{{GA|256}}</ref> and Círdan's people fled to the [[Mouths of Sirion]] and the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
