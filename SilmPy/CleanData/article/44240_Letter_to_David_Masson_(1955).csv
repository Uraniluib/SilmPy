==Excerpt==

{{Blockquote|The languages have, of course, changed quite as much as the world and its stories to which they belong, and are now almost an [[Ents|Entish]] record of my own linguistic-Ã¦sthetic history, hardening at last with age. But you are quite right in your perceptions. [[Quenya]] still retains the traces of the impact upon me of Finnish. [[Sindarin]] was deliberately composed to resemble (with a difference) Welsh, by working similar sound-changes on the simple basic [[Eldarin]] structure to those exhibited by Brythonic, especially Welsh.|<ref name=PE17/>}}
