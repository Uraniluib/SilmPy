The '''Crissaegrim''' were a mountain range, forming a part of the southern [[Echoriad|Echoriath]], the ''Encircling Mountains'' of [[Gondolin]], and were inaccessible from the ground.  However they were home to the great [[Eagles]],<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and from here [[Thorondor]], Lord of the Eagles, watched for spies in the vale of the River [[Sirion]].  Indeed, the Eagles were the chief source of information to [[Turgon]] and the [[Gondolindrim]].

It was from the Crissaegrim that Thorondor espied [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] when they were lost in [[Dimbar]].  The Lord of the Eagles sent two great birds to carry the men above the Crissaegrim into [[Tumladen]], when King [[Turgon]] of Gondolin welcomed them.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 35</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Crissaegrim'' is a [[Sindarin]] name that includes the root ''kris-''.<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref> meaning "Cleft Mountain Peaks". It is usually referred to as the "'''Abode of Eagles'''".<ref name="Beleriand"/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early versions of the [[Quenta Silmarillion]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] used the name '''''Gochressiel''''', which he amended to ''Crisaegrim'' (later spelt ''Crissaegrim''). [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the name ''Gochressiel'' might not have referred exclusively to this southern section of the mountains, but rather to the whole of Echoriath.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 285, 290-1</ref>
