[[File:Jeff Reitz - Precious Gold Ring.png|thumb|''Precious Gold Ring'' by Jeff Reitz]]
'''Gold''' refers to both a valuable mineral in [[Middle-earth]] and golden colour or golden light.  Although valuable, the metal was not nearly as valuable as ''[[mithril]]'' ([[Gimli]] stated that when the [[Dwarves]] mined ''mithril'' in [[Moria]] it was worth ten times the value of gold and that after the coming of [[Durin's Bane]] mithril was beyond price).<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

==History==
Gold was present in the deeps of Arda since its creation by [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]. It was no doubt discovered by [[Aulë]], the great smith who was the first to make use of it. Afterwards, it was to be used by all speaking peoples of earth particularly the Dwarves who mastered it and by the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]].

[[The One Ring]] was made of gold,<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref> as was [[Vilya]], the Elven Ring of [[Elrond]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>  The treasure of [[Smaug]] also contained gold, wrought and unwrought.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>

<!-- I suggest only referencing those words which don't have an article of their own (User:Morgan) -->

*[[Quenya]]: ''[[malda]]'', ''[[laure]]'' (the colour, not the metal)
*[[Sindarin]]/[[Noldorin]]: ''[[malt]]''
*[[Adûnaic]]: ''[[pharaz]]''

In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for "gold" is ''glôr'' (''glôriol'' means "golden, like gold", and ''glôrin'' means "golden, of gold"). The poetic word for "gold" is ''Culu''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 27, 40</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In [[The Book of Lost Tales]] a portion of gold was used in the creation of [[Tilkal]], to construct [[Angainor]].<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 100</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Gold (Mal) is valued by the Dwarves above all other metals, save mithril. Elven smiths mix it with other metals to make strong alloys.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}</ref>
