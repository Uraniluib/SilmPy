The '''Entwash''' was a great river in [[Rohan]], notable for its huge inland delta.

==Geography==
The sources of the Entwash were springs whose waters fell from [[Methedras]], the southernmost peak of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Where they coalesced into one stream the collected waters flowed just south of [[Wellinghall]], [[Treebeard]]'s home. At its origin the Entwash was a noisy stream that cascaded over rocks and then hurried down the sloped terrain of Fangorn. From there the stream coursed eastward through [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] to the south-east corner of the forest.<ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|III4}}</ref>

Upon leaving the forest the river was still swift-flowing and its banks were deeply carven.<ref name="Uruk">{{TT|III3}}</ref> Leaving the woods, the river flowed past [[the Wold]] of Rohan, and then headed south. As the river passed southward across Rohan its flow became more sluggish and the banks became fens.<ref name="Riders">{{TT|III2}}</ref> At some point it was traversed by the [[Entwade]] ford. At the latitude of [[Edoras]] it was joined by the river [[Snowbourn]] from the west; at their confluence great thickets of willows grew.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>

Turning east, the Entwash flowed towards [[Anduin]], which it joined just south of the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]], in the huge inland delta known as the [[Mouths of Entwash]]. The splitting of the river marked the border of Rohan. The [[Mering Stream]] (or ''Glanhír'') met the southernmost of the Entwash's arms there. The delta where the Entwash widened and joined the Anduin was a land of marshes that travelers were advised to avoid.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref> The influx of water was so great that across the Anduin the marshes of [[Nindalf]] (Wetwang) arose.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2510}}, when the Steward [[Cirion]] granted the land of [[Calenardhon]] to [[Eorl]] the Young to be the realm of [[Rohan]], the two leaders (along with the [[Prince of Dol Amroth]] and [[Éomund]], the chief captain of the host of the [[Éothéod]]) defined the borders of their respective domains.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> The border ran along the Mering Stream from the [[Firienholt|Firien Wood]] to the southernmost arm of the Entwash, west up this waterway to the beginning of the delta, and then east along the northernmost arm of the Entwash to the Anduin.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>

The upper part of the Entwash served as another boundary, for it divided Rohan into [[Westemnet]] and [[Eastemnet]]. These were also known as the [[West-mark]] and [[East-mark]] for military purposes.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

After the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Orcs]] carried [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to the point where this river exited [[Fangorn Forest]], followed by [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].
The Orcs were stopped just short of Fangorn by riders from Rohan.<ref name="Uruk"/> Merry and Pippin found the opportunity to escape and they followed the river into the woods, and taken by [[Treebeard]] the Ent west along the stream to his home.<ref name="Treebeard"/> In the meantime the [[Three Hunters]] followed the tracks along the river and into the forest, where they met [[Gandalf]] the White.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

When [[Éomer]] became [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]] he discarded the old offices of Second and Third Marshals of Rohan and instead created the positions of [[Marshal of the West-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Erkenbrand]]) and [[Marshal of the East-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Elfhelm]]).<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Entwash was a translation of the [[Sindarin]] name ''Onodló'', named for the [[Ents]] ([[Onodrim]]) of Fangorn Forest,<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 46</ref> but the origin of the name was largely forgotten by the [[Rohirrim]]. ''Onodló'' comes from ''[[Onod]]'' "Ent" and ''[[ló]]'' "stream".{{fact}}

Entwash is a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Entwaesc'' (''waesc'' "flood water"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 769-70</ref>
