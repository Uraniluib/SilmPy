'''Kalormë''' was a great mountain in [[Oronto]] (the farthest East of the world). The peak seems to have been the second tallest mountain in [[Arda]], corresponding to the [[Oiolossë]] far in the [[Aman|West]].<ref name="LT1">{{LT1|IX}}, pp. 212, 225</ref>

==Etymology==
In the ''Qenya Lexicon'', the name '''''kalorme(e)''''' is glossed as "hill-crest over which the Sun rises".<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 44</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 256-7</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
In later works, Kalorme is not mentioned. However the [[Land of the Sun]] was marked by a great, curve-shaped mountain range called the [[Walls of the Sun]], which corresponded symmetrically to the [[Pelóri]] of Aman.<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref>
==Inspiration==
It is notable that the name Kalormë is similar to [http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Calormen Calormen] of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], althought it is unknown if [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] thought of this name.
