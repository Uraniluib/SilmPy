The '''Drúadan''' language referred to the tongue of the [[Woses|Drúedain]].<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 99</ref>

==Characteristics==

The voices of the Drúedain are said to have been "''deep and guttural''",<ref>{{UT|12}}</ref> possibly also describing the sound of their language as [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]]'s accent when using [[Westron]] is described with the very same words.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref><ref name=Fauskanger/>

[[Helge Fauskanger]] has noted that the Drúadan tongue appears to be unrelated to the [[Westron|Common Speech]].<ref name=Fauskanger/> According to a late manuscript by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], it had possibly been influenced by [[Elvish]] (at least for the word ''[[gorgûn]]'').<ref>{{WJ|AC}}, p. 391</ref>

==Names==

In a manuscript by Tolkien written in the late 1950s, he uses the name ''Druadan'' (also referring to a member of the Drúedain in ''The Lord of the Rings''; amended to ''Drúadan'' in the second edition) for the language of the Woses.<ref name=PE17/>

This seems to be the only occurrence where Tolkien uses a name for this tongue: since the manuscript was published as late as 2007, fans and scholars have often used the unattested name '''''Drúedainic''''' to refer to the same tongue.<ref name=Fauskanger>[[Helge Fauskanger]], "[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm Various Mannish Tongues - the sadness of Mortal Men?]" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/index.html Ardalambion] (accessed 28 December 2010)</ref><ref>Andreas Moehn, [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html Etymologies of the Atani Languages] at [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/M-earth.html Middle-earth Science Pages] (accessed 31 July 2011)</ref><ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/15239 Message 15239] (dated 23 May 2002) at [Elfling (mailing list)</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: The tongue of the Woses is called Pûkael, said to be "''ideally suited to their voices and... alien to that of other Men''".<ref>{{ICE|2001}}, p. 175</ref> Pûkael is nearly impossible for other people to pronounce, and the Woses are not willing to teach it.<ref>{{ICE|4002}}, p. 27</ref>
