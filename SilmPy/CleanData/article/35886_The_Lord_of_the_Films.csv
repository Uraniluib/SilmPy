==From the publisher==

{{blockquote|A unique scene-by-scene breakdown of all of the Lord of the Rings movies, this guide provides in-depth analysis of the live-action trilogy and other related films, alongside games, puzzles, and interviews with the filmmakers. Each scene is explored in four different ways: a closer look at the plot and the action, a look behind the scenes, a reveal of mistakes that slipped through, and audience reactions. In addition to covering the stunning Peter Jackson trilogy and other adaptions (including the animated adaptations), details are also revealed about the prequel films currently in production, making this an essential volume for any Lord of the Rings fan.}}
