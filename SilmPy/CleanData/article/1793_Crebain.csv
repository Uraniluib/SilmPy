'''Crebain''' were large birds of the [[crows|crow-kind]], native to [[Dunland]] and [[Fangorn Forest]].

==History==
The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] encountered various flocks of ''crebain'' on their arrival in [[Hollin]]. Fearing that they were used as spies by [[Saruman]], the Fellowship spent the entire day in hiding, without a campfire.<ref name="RGS">{{FR|South}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
''Crebain'' is the [[Sindarin]] plural of ''craban''.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:A flock of ''Crebain'' "from [[Dunland]]" appears when the Fellowship is in Hollin. Though [[Gimli]] at first dismisses it as a cloud, [[Boromir]] notices them going too fast, and against the wind. The Fellowship hide as the birds swoop by.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Ring Goes South (scene)|The Ring Goes South]]"</ref> The ''crebain'' are revealed to have indeed been spies when they report to Saruman at [[Isengard]] later.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Fighting Uruk-hai]]"</ref>
