'''''Shadow Rising''''' is an album by [[Soundestiny]] that was released in 2004.

It was inspired by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and was the band's first album. The music was written by Darryl Grant Potter and Michael Bohl; lyrics were by Darryl Grant Potter.  After two more albums – ''Journey Through Love'' in 2006, and [[All that Glitters]] in 2009, [[Soundestiny]] released the follow-up LOTR-inspired album – [[Winds of Change]] in 2010. The band then returned to the studio to record another folk rock album of music entitled [[Dragon Quest]], inspired by ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The albums ''Shadow Rising'' and [[Winds of Change]] together form a 25 song rock opera or rock musical titled '''RingLord'''. This rock musical was inspired by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' only. Throughout the song lyrics, there are no mentions of any of the characters from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', such as [[Gandalf]] or [[Aragorn]], nor of [[Middle-earth]] place names like [[Rivendell]] or [[Lothlórien|Lothlorien]].
