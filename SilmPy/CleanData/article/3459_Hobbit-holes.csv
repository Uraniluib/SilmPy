Originally the [[Hobbits]]' preferred style of dwelling, holes buried into hillsides, downs and banks. By the late [[Third Age]], these had largely been replaced by buildings of wood or brick, but hobbit-holes were still in use by the more established Hobbit families of [[the Shire]], known as ''[[smials]]'' (for example, at [[Bag End]] and [[Great Smials]]), or by the poorest who "went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none".<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

In [[Bree-hobbits]] burrowed Hobbit-holes in the [[Bree-hill]].
