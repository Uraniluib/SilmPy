==Excerpt==

"I do not suppose I will write any more about [[Hobbits]], but the success of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been quite as surprising to [[Allen and Unwin|the publishers]] as to me (possibly more so) that it seems likely now that they will wish to publish the legend of the [[First Age|First]] and [[Second Age|Second Ages]] (written first but refused)." The rejected material in question, of course, was published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Tolkien admits rather reluctantly to his correspondent that he is a native of South Africa. "I...belong really to the N. West of the Old World," he says, "...[but] I suppose that even in '[[The Shire]]' they had heard some tales of the [[Far Harad|far south]]."<ref name=UpFront/><ref name=hammond/>
