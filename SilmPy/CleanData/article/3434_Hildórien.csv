'''Hildórien''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "Land of the [[Men|Followers]]", pron. [[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[hilˈdoːri.en]}}) was the land in the far [[east]]<ref>In a very early map of symmetrical [[Arda]], there is a region marked "Hildorien" at the very eastern shores of the land-mass that would become Middle-earth. Cf. {{SM|A4}}</ref> of [[Middle-earth]] in which the first [[Men]] or [[Hildor]], awoke at the beginning of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|12}}</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>

It was said among the [[Elves]], that [[Morgoth]] went there and put a darkness in the hearts of the Men.<ref>{{S|17}}</ref> Some Men, who were at war with those who fell under the [[Shadow]], fled Hildórien seeking the [[Light of Valinor|Light]] of the [[Aman|West]].<ref name=DM>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The ''[[Silmarillion]]'' appendix confirms that Hildórien is of the same [[root]] as the word ''[[Hildor]]''.<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref> It can be therefore understood as [[Quenya]] [[Hildor]] + [[-ien]], therefore "Land of the Followers".
==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Men awoke in a hidden valley called '''Murmenalda''', the Vale of Sleep or Slumbrous Dale. It was enclosed by a wall of encircling mountains, east of [[Palisor]], described as "hallowed" and full of sweet fragrances and odours, and songs of [[nightingales]], its beauty being comparable to [[Valinor]]. It was full of sleeping figures.

It was discovered by the [[Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Nuin]] after finding a passage through the mountain wall. Nuin almost swooned at its loveliness and was puzzled by the Sleepers. Despite [[Tuvon|Tu]]'s warnings, Nuin visited it often to watch the Sleepers until, overcome with curiosity, he woke the first pair of them.<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>

Murmenalda is [[Qenya]], composed of ''murme'' "sleep" ([[root]] MURU) and ''nalda'' (root NLDL).<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>
