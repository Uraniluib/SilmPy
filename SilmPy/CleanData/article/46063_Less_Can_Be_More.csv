<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Less can be more,
And small can be beautiful,
For life isn't all
Just big and wonderful.

And what do I need,
When you get right down to it?
All my cares come from greed,
And it's time that I knew it.

Things I can't do without
Are the small things that life is all about.

Less can be more,
And small can be beautiful,
I don't want it all;
Just part of wonderful.

For what do I need,
When you get right down to it?
Just a garden and seed,
And the love to pursue it.

Things I can't do without
Are the small things that life is all about.
