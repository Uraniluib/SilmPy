'''Loëndë''' was also known, especially by the [[Hobbits]], as [[Mid-year's Day]]. ''Loëndë'' was the day that fell in the middle of the year in many of the calendars of [[Middle-earth]]. Since Mid-year's Day in the [[Shire Calendar]] was intended to correspond with the [[wikipedia:Solstice|summer solstice]], then this should apply to ''loëndë'' in the [[Kings' Reckoning]] and [[Stewards' Reckoning]] calendars of [[Gondor]] as well. In the [[New Reckoning]], ''loëndë'' corresponded with [[24 September]] in the Shire Calendar.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>
