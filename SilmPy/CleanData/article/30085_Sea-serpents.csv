'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
: Water Drakes, or Water Serpents, are drakes who have adapted to a life in freshwater pools or in the ocean. The smaller varieties, who only live in fresh-water, are called Rain-drakes (or Lake-worms), while the larger (who prey in all types of water) are called True Water-drakes or Sea Serpents.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}, pp. 116-117</ref> An individual Water-drake, ''Séahmatha'' (meaning "Lake Serpent" in the tongue of the Northmen), inhabits the Long Lake.<ref>{{ICE|2016}}, pp. 121-128</ref>

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:"Sea Serpent" and "Rain-drake" are creatures of the Drake-kind. A unique dragon of the water is Eärcaraxë, which may be played keyed to coastal regions and sites.
