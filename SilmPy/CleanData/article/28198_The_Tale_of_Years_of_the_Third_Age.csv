'''The Tale of Years of the Third Age''' is the eighth chapter of ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', the twelfth book in the series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.  This chapter describes the writing and development of the history of the [[Third Age]] that would be published in the second part of [[Appendix B]].

==Earliest Timeline==
The first version of the Tale of Years of the Third Age begins with the death of Isildur, declaring it Year 0. From there, [[Sauron]] is said to have reawoken and entered Mirkwood in 1000, where he established Dol Dugul (in the final version this will become [[Dol Guldur]]).

In 1100, Deagol and Smeagol came across the One Ring. Smeagol killed Deagol, became [[Gollum]], and entered the Misty Mountains by 1105. Separately, the brothers' people multiplied, crossed the Misty Mountains in 1300, and became [[Hobbits]]. (At around this time Orcs began to reappear.) In 1500 the Hobbits settled at [[Bree]]. A century later, Marco and Cavallo crossed the Brandywine and the king at Northworthy granted them the Shire. (This event marks the beginning of Shire-reckoning.)

==About the Text==
The earliest version of the Tale of Years of the Third Age was a short text that seemed closely related to the version of the Tale of Years of the Second Age which [[Christopher Tolkien]] had designated T2 in the sixth chapter, ''[[The Tale of Years of the Second Age]]''. Because of this connection, although the two manuscripts were clearly distinct from each other, Christopher designated the relevant Third Age document T2 as well.

JRR Tolkien provided Shire-reckoning dates for all events that had them in this first timeline, but Christopher declined to include these.
