High on the mountain of [[Halifirien]], overlooking the border between the two kingdoms, the wardens keep their watch for the ancient signal that will call the men of the west to unite against the threat of [[Mordor]].

As [[Sauron]]'s shadow grows over [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]] ''(sic)'', [[Orcs|orc]] war bands maraud further into the free lands, and one night invade the hallowed mountain upon which the wardens keep their watch.  As Eradur (James Robinson) and his brother (Dominic Downes) are on guard they hear the noise of battle from further down the mountain.  Do they go and help their friends?  Or stay and keep to their sworn duty?

Eradur will face the loss of those most dear to him as he is hunted down by bloodthirsty orcs and forced to confront his fears alone. </blockquote>
