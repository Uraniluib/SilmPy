{{disambig-two|the earlier version of [[Sindarin]]|dialect of [[Quenya]] spoken by the [[Noldor]] in [[Middle-earth]]|[[Exilic Quenya]]}}
'''Noldorin''' is an [[Elvish]] dialect from an earlier version of the [[legendarium]], a precursor to [[Sindarin]].

==History==
[[Kornoldorin]] ("Gnomish of [[Kôr]]" or "Old Noldorin") was the language of the [[Gnomes]] in [[Valinor]]. It was similar to [[Qenya]], the language of the [[Vanyar|Lindar]], but incorporated [[Solosimpin]] influence.

When the Gnomes came to the [[Great Lands]] with [[Fëanor]], they intermingled with the [[Ilkorindi]], the [[Dark Elves]], and their languages, Kornoldorin and [[Ilkorin]] respectively, were likewise mingled. This was the origin of Noldorin. 

Noldorin was rich in various dialects, including those of [[Mithrim]], [[Gondolin]], [[Nargothrond]], and [[Himring]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}} p.177</ref><ref>{{PE|14}} p.61-62</ref>

==External history==
A Celtic-sounding language spoken by the Gnomes/Noldoli existed since the beginning of Tolkien's mythology. In its first stages it was called [[Gnomish]] and resembled the later Noldorin/Sindarin despite noticeable differences. 

The evolution of the language continued over several years. During the 1930s it was known as Noldorin, and gained a greater similarity to the Sindarin of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. This version of the language appears in the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]''. 

Noldorin was the existing version of the language during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings''. The Elvish phrases in ''The Lord of the Rings'', now known as Sindarin, were "Noldorin" in Tolkien's mind throughout the writing process. It was only while compiling the Appendices that he decided to rewrite the language's back-story and change the name to Sindarin. 

Tolkien consulted the Noldorin language of the ''Etymologies'' extensively in his work on Sindarin, adapting old words to fit his new version of the language. This same method of adapting Noldorin words to create Sindarin equivalents is used by modern students of Elvish. The resulting vocabulary is typically referred to as "[[Neo-Sindarin]]" to distinguish it from attested Sindarin. 

===An Example of Noldorin to Sindarin Adaption===
The Old Noldorin initial ''l-/r-'' became ''lh-/rh-'' in Noldorin. In Sindarin, however, they remain the same. The Old Noldorin diphthong ''ai'' becomes ''oe'' in Noldorin, but ''ae'' in Sindarin. 

According to the ''Etymologies'', the Old Noldorin word ''raika'' evolved into Noldorin ''rhoeg''. A modern student of Elvish would update this word to the Neo-Sindarin *''raeg''.
