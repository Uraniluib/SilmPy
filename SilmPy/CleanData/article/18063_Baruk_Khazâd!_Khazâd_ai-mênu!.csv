'''Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!''' was a [[Khuzdul]] battlecry. 

==History==
Though the battle-cry was much older, the first recorded use was in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]: 

<blockquote>''But a [[Gimli|small dark figure]] that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: ''Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!'' An axe swung and swept back. Two Orcs fell headless. The rest fled.''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', "[[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]]"</ref></blockquote>

Later, Gimli gave some variations on the battle-cry: ''Khazâd! Khazâd!'' and ''Khazâd ai-mênu!''. 

==Etymology==
The cry is translated "Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], '[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix F]], I: The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age; Of Dwarves</ref>
