{{quote|In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole and that means comfort.|[[The Hobbit]], "[[An Unexpected Party]]"}}

'''Smials''' were the [[hobbit-holes]] tunelled into earth mounds and hills. 

For generations the [[Hobbits]], made diggings in the earth to live. By the later [[Third Age]] the poorest Hobbits still went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind with only one window or none.

For the most well-to-do hobbits, smials were luxurious versions of those primitive diggings of old. Their tunnels had rounded walls and branched to other rooms.<ref name=conc>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Smials included [[Bag End]] and the smials along [[Bagshot Row]] of [[Hobbiton]], the [[Great Smials]] of [[Tuckborough]]<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> and [[Brandy Hall]].<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref> The latter two were large enough to have ample room for a hundred Hobbits.

When suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels were not everywhere to be found, many Hobbits lived in wood, brick or stone houses.<ref name=conc/> This was the case with some muddy regions of the [[Eastfarthing]], such as the [[Marish]].<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''smial'' is an invention of Tolkien based on the [[Old English]] word ''smygel''. Smial is a translation of the [[Hobbitish]] word ''[[trân]]'' ([[Rohirric]] ''[[trahan]]'' "burrow").<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explained in his [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]] the origin of the name ''Sméagol'' in the lemma on [[smials]]:

{{quote|'''Smials'''. A word peculiar to hobbits (not Common Speech), meaning 'burrow'; leave unchanged. It is a form that the Old English word '''smygel''' 'burrow' might have had, if it had survived. The same element appears in Gollum's real name, '''Sméagol'''.|Tolkien <ref name="ATC">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), "Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]])</ref>}}

The names [[Smaug]] and [[Gollum|Sméagol]] are etymologically related.

==In real world==
"Smial" is a term used by [[Tolkien fan]]s to refer to divisions of Tolkien Societies.
