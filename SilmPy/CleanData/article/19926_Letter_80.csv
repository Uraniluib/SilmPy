==Summary==
Tolkien told Christopher of his attempts to teach [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]] the meaning of [[wikipedia:G.K. Chesterton|G.K. Chesterton]]'s ''[[wikipedia:The Ballad of the White Horse|The Ballad of the White Horse]]''. In explaining it, he realized the poem was not as good as he thought, and Chesterton was completely oblivious to Northern culture, both Christian and Heathen.
