'''''Dead Ringers''''' was a comedy sketch show on [[BBC]] Two which frequently parodied and referenced [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] and the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] more broadly. It ran for seven series, between [[2002]] and [[2007]].

==Series 3==
In Episode 1, the use of [[Bigatures]] by [[Weta Workshop]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]'' was referenced in a sketch wherein [[wikipedia:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] claimed the [[wikipedia:Iraq War|Iraq War]] was all faked with the use of models; Blair asks [[wikipedia:Kirsty Wark|Kirsty Wark]], "''I take it you've seen ''The Lord of the Rings''?''" to which she replies, "''No, I fear [[dwarves]].''". Also, the show parodied [[wikipedia:How Clean Is Your House?|How Clean Is Your House?]] with [[wikipedia:Aggie MacKenzie|Aggie MacKenzie]] calling herself "''the [[Gollum]] of grime''" and the owner's house being described as "''a cross between [[Mordor]] and Afghanistan''".<ref name="S3E1">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 1 (see 3:26 - 4:56 and 17:00 - 18:13). Originally broadcast on [[wikipedia:BBC|BBC]] [[wikipedia:BBC Two|Two]] on [[10 May|10]] [[May]] [[2004]]</ref>

In Episode 2, parodying the fact that the [[wikipedia:Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] of [[wikipedia:Thailand|Thailand]], [[wikipedia:Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin Shinawatra]], had tried to purchase [[wikipedia:Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]], BBC News reports that "''another foreign leader with a questionable human rights record''", [[Saruman]], had bought [[wikipedia:Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United F.C.]] The manager, [[wikipedia:Bobby Robson|Bobby Robson]], explains that [[Shelob]] and [[Sméagol]] (invisible thanks to [[The One Ring]]) will be playing for the team.<ref name="S3E2">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 2 (see 10:38 - 12.08). Originally broadcast on [[wikipedia:BBC|BBC]] [[wikipedia:BBC Two|Two]] on [[17 May|17]] [[May]] [[2004]]</ref>

The third episode combined the characters of the recently-returned, [[wikipedia:Auf Wiedersehen, Pet|Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]] - a programme about seven fictional British construction-workers working abroad - whose characters go to [[Middle-earth]] in search of work. They are employed by [[Gandalf]] to rebuild [[The Shire]] following the [[Scouring of the Shire]], but - in common with all series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet -  a nasty foreman turns up ([[Saruman]]) and one of the team falls in love with a local (an [[orcs|orc]]) who is then taught to speak [[wikipedia:Geordie|Geordie]].<ref name="S3E3">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 3 (see 16:30 - 18:16). Originally broadcast on [[wikipedia:BBC|BBC]] [[wikipedia:BBC Two|Two]] on [[24 May|24]] [[May]] [[2004]]</ref>

In a lengthy sketch in Episode 4, the ''Dead Ringers'' team  are parodying the ending to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' film, and its length, by having a voice-over over their version of [[The Grey Havens (scene)|The Grey Havens]]: "''Coming soon on DVD, a must-have for all fans of The Lord of the Rings. Yes, all of the extra endings to ''Return of the King'' that they couldn't fit in the film.''" [[Gandalf]] suggests they could catch a later boat - which [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] suggests will come "''about 9''" -  and that in the meantime they could play [[wikipedia:Scrabble|Scrabble]]. "''We know how disappointed you were that the cinema release of ''The Return of King'' had only 23 final scenes, now experience the DVD director's cut with all 98 endings.''" Every time [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and Gandalf are about to leave, they have a reason to come back: Gandalf tells [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] that [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back he is Merry's father]; they have a custard-pie fight; they destroyed the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star Death Star]. As they are about to leave (now with Merry, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] reading newspapers in a bored manner), [[wikipedia:Jaws (film)|a shark arrives]]. "''You can relive the cinematic experience of starting to leave because you think the film has finished, only having to sit back down again and again... this time from the comfort of your own home. Every last bum-numbing ending is here.''"<ref name="S3E4">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 4 (see 9:23 -11:44). Originally broadcast on [[wikipedia:BBC|BBC]] [[wikipedia:BBC Two|Two]] on [[31 May|31]] [[May]] [[2004]]</ref>

Finally, in Episode 6, [[Gandalf]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] are once again at the [[Grey Havens]], beckoning [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] to the ship. Bilbo refuses, saying that he wants to go home and the [[elves]] dislike him; acting like an obstinate - and paranoid - elderly man, refusing to go into care, he insists, "''I'm not getting on any boat! ... You're just after my savings. I went on a f***ing quest for you young [[hobbits]], and this is all the thanks I get! You lay one finger on me, beardy, and I'll call social services!''"<ref name="S3E6">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 6 (see 9:20 -10:19).
