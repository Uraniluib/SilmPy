'''Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck''', called '''The Magnificent''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck]].<ref name=tree>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>  Merry (as he was often called), was the heir of the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] to [[Brandy Hall]], and, after his participation to the [[War of the Ring]], eventually became the Master there.

==History==
Meriadoc was the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda]]. Claiming descent from [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], he also had  [[Took Family|Tookish]] blood through his mother, and also his father's grandmother, [[Mirabella Took]]. He was also first cousins with Peregrin Took.<ref name=tree/>

Around {{TA|3000}} Merry witnessed a strange scene: he saw [[Bilbo Baggins]] becoming invisible in order to avoid a meeting with the [[Sackville-Bagginses]]. Startled, he got through the hedge and walked along the field inside, and watched as Bilbo reappeared, and put a [[The One Ring|glint of gold]] in his pocket. This made teenage Meriadoc very curious and he even looked into Bilbo's [[There and Back Again|private diary]].<ref name="Conspiracy"/>

Merry kept this knowledge private but was always suspicious. He was present with his family at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]<ref name=tree/> and since Bilbo's disappearance, he believed that Frodo would soon follow. He shared his secrets with a group of Frodo's friends (namely [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Fredegar Bolger]]) the "[[Conspirators]]". Especially after [[April]] {{TA|3018}} he noticed how Frodo was saying "farewell" to his favourite places, selling [[Bag End]] to the [[Sackville-Bagginses]], and secretive talks with [[Gandalf]]. All along, Sam Gamgee had been their "chief investigator". He heard Gandalf's instructions to Frodo for his departure<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>, and warned his friends about it.<ref name="Conspiracy"/>
[[File:Abe_Papakhian_-_A_Conspiracy_Unmasked.jpg|thumb|left|Abe Papakhian - ''A Conspiracy Unmasked'']]
The Conspirators, sought to protect Frodo (and [[The One Ring|the Ring]]) without his knowledge. When Frodo sold [[Bag End]] to move to [[Crickhollow]], Merry and Fredegar were told to wait for him and make preparations for his arrival. However, knowing that Frodo would begin a secret journey, also arranged for provisions and [[ponies]], planning to accompany him. On the [[September 25|appointed day]], Merry went to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] and waited for Frodo, Sam and Pippin, who arrived a couple days later on [[Farmer Maggot]]'s wagon.<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}</ref>

After dinner in Crickhollow, Frodo prepared to reveal to his friends that he was going to have to leave Crickhollow and go to [[Rivendell]]. It was then that the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo and demanded to be taken along when he left. Because of their preparations, they were able to start right away.<ref name="Conspiracy">{{FR|I5}}</ref>
===Journey with Frodo===
{{quote|You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo.|Merry, ''[[A Conspiracy Unmasked]]''}}

During the following trip to [[Rivendell]], Merry seemed to have a greater knowledge of the [[Old Forest]] than any of the other Hobbits.  However, when they encountered [[Old Man Willow]] Merry (and Pippin) were both captured and had to be rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>  Merry and Pippin were captured again (along with Sam and Frodo) by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] upon the [[Barrow-downs]], but Tom again came to their rescue. Before leaving, he told them to keep the [[Daggers of Westernesse]] found in the Barrow Downs, and he advised them to spend the night at the [[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]], inside [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I8}}</ref> 
[[File:John Howe - Weathertop on the Horizon.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Weathertop on the Horizon'']]
Upon reaching the inn, Merry was out for a walk and saw a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]. He tried to follow it, but it disappeared. Merry was then overtaken by the [[Black Breath]] and fainted. But before any harm could come to him, [[Nob]] came to his aid; he returned to the Prancing Pony and warned his companions who were talking with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].<ref name="Strider">{{FR|I10}}</ref>  During the trip through the wild with Strider, he often saw the most deeply into the others.  After Frodo was wounded on [[Weathertop]], he became the one who consulted most with Strider, and in a way became the spokesman for the Hobbits.

After reaching [[Rivendell]], he, with Pippin, insisted on not being left behind on the [[Quest of the Ring]].  Therefore they were chosen as the eighth and ninth members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

At the gate of [[Moria]], [[Gandalf]] commended Merry for being "''of all people''" on the right track with the riddle (though this was accidental).  His impetuosity in Moria was such that he nearly fell into an ancient well while running ahead with Pippin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  When they reached [[Lothlórien]], he was allowed to sleep in a [[telain]] with Frodo, Sam, Pippin and a few elven guards. He, as with the rest of the Company, walked blindfolded into the Woods of Lórien in a show of support for [[Gimli]], who had to be blindfolded due to being a [[Dwarves|dwarf]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - The Plains of Rohan 2.jpg|thumb|"The Plains of Rohan" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
At the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Merry and Pippin ran straight into a company of [[Orcs]] while they were looking for Frodo.  [[Boromir]] attempted to rescue them, but many [[Uruk-hai]] arrived, and they shot him with arrows.  Captured with Pippin by Uruk-hai, the two were separated from the rest of the Fellowship.  Merry aided Pippin in an attempt to deceive [[Grishnákh]] into thinking that they had the One Ring, and he could have it.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>  Because of this, they escaped into [[Fangorn Forest]] during the attack by [[Éomer]] and his [[Rohirrim|Outriders]]. There they met [[Treebeard]].

[[File:Zina Saunders - Flotsam and Jetsam.jpg|thumb|Zina Saunders - ''Flotsam and Jetsam'']]
Thus they became the first mortals for many centuries to encounter the [[Ents]] of Fangorn. They drank of the [[Ent-draughts|Ent-draught]] which caused Merry and Pippin to become the tallest hobbits in history. Also, they were present at the [[Entmoot]],<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> and the resulting destruction of [[Isengard]], after which Treebeard appointed them door-wardens of [[Orthanc]]. It was while they were enjoying [[Saruman]]'s [[pipe-weed]], that they were reunited with some of their former companions, who arrived after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

===Esquire of Théoden===
While Pippin and Gandalf headed away to [[Minas Tirith]], Merry stayed with Aragorn and the Rohirrim, developing a close friendship with King [[Théoden]].  Out of love for him, Merry offered the King his service, which Théoden warmly accepted.  "''As a father you shall be to me''", Merry said at that time, and Théoden responded "''For a little while''".<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

As Théoden's esquire, Merry returned with him to [[Edoras]] and was forbidden - firmly but gently - by the King to ride with them to the aid of Minas Tirith because he could not ride the mighty horses of the Rohirrim so fast and so far.  Merry was disappointed until a young rider named [[Dernhelm]] offered to bear him on his horse.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>  In this manner he rode to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], having a secret understanding with [[Elfhelm]] and several others of the Rohirrim.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Éowyn against Witch-king'']]
During the charge and the commencement of the battle he was almost useless, hiding behind Dernhelm and shaking with fright and nausea.  However, Dernhelm's steed, [[Windfola]], threw them both upon the coming of the [[Witch-king]].  Affected by the Black Breath, Merry lay almost senseless on the ground, hearing the voice of Dernhelm standing over the body of Théoden -- who had been mortally wounded by the Witch-king -- defying the Nazgûl.  He was startled as he opened his eyes to find that Dernhelm was really [[Éowyn]], the King's niece.  After Éowyn was thrown down, perhaps mortally wounded, Merry rose to attack the Witch-king in order to protect her.  He stabbed the Witch-king through the calf with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]] he still bore, thus breaking the spell of invulnerability surrounding the Wraith.  He fainted as Éowyn finished off the Witch-king with a thrust into the head.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

After the battle, Pippin found him ill and wandering in a daze outside of [[Minas Tirith]] and alerted Aragorn, who brought him into the city. Almost killed by the Black Breath, he and Éowyn were revived by Aragorn in the [[Houses of Healing]].<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref>  Because of his condition he was unable to take part in the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> but afterwards attended the burial of [[Théoden]], at which he wept greatly.  Upon his departure for the Shire, he was given a special horn by Éomer and Éowyn as a parting gift, which was later used in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

Upon the return to the Shire, he was, with Pippin, the primary leader of the uprising against [[Sharkey]] and his [[Ruffians]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

===After the War===
At some time he stayed with Pippin at Crickhollow<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and he married the sister of his friend Fredegar, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella]].

He was afterwards known as '''Meriadoc the Magnificent''', and became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father. He wrote several scholarly works which were part of the [[Red Book]]: ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'', ''The Reckoning of Years'' and ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''. In {{FoA|13}} he was made with Pippin and Sam Counsellor of the North-kingdom.

At {{FoA|63}}<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref> with his friend they resigned from their offices and came down to Rohan (presumably after the death of his wife) at the request of King Éomer, where he was known as Master Holbytla and [[Holdwine]] of the Shire.  

After the King died, he travelled to Gondor with Pippin, where he was known as Master [[Perian]]. They both died several years later, and were laid in [[Rath Dínen]].  It was said that upon [[Aragorn|King Elessar]]'s death, their bodies were placed beside his.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>

==Character==
He was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]], who eventually became the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and [[Peregrin Took]], a young relative.  He was one of the few (if any) who saw [[Bilbo Baggins]], Frodo's uncle, actually use [[the One Ring]].  He also managed to read, at least in part, Bilbo's book: ''[[There and Back Again]]'', where he learned about the Ring.<ref name="Conspiracy"/>

He can easily be recognised as a very sharp Hobbit, and his tone throughout ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' depicts him as practical, loyal, resourceful, and the best able to cope with the sudden happenings that drew him out of his peaceful home.  He was also praised by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] as having a 'stout heart'<ref name="Strider"/> and [[Éowyn|Lady Éowyn]] as 'valiant'.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>  He was apparently much trusted by Frodo, who sent him along with [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] to [[Crickhollow]] to prepare his newly-bought home.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

==Other Versions of the Legendarium==
In the pre-publication manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Merry's name was originally "Marmaduke Brandybuck".<ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, p. 33</ref>

==Inspiration==
''Meriadoc'' (also spelled ''Meriadek'') was the legendary leader of a group of Welsh mercenaries who settled Armorica (modern Brittany) in the fourth century and founded the house of [[Rohan]].<ref> [[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[The Hobbitonian Anthology]]'', p. 57</ref> 

==Etymology==
The name '''''Meriadoc''''' means "Great Lord" in [[Welsh]] (from ''mawr''="great" and ''udd''="lord").<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.namenerds.com/welsh/meaning.html|articlename=Welsh Names|website=[http://www.namenerds.com/ Name Nerds]|accessed=21 February 2016}}</ref>

Tolkien himself comments on the ''[[Celtic]] cast'' of this and other [[Buckland]] and [[Bree]] names that end in –ac, -ic, -oc. <ref>{{HM|PM}}, "[[The Appendix on Languages]]"</ref>

:Merry was played by [[Dominic Monaghan]].  Some book-readers argue that, like Pippin, he was made far less competent in the movie than he was in the books: instead of a clever "conspirator" who helped orchestrate Frodo's escape from the Shire, he was portrayed as someone who did not know what he was getting himself into. The movie trilogy also shows a blonde Merry as opposed to the brown-haired young hobbit in the novels.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The voice of Merry was provided by [[Quinton Flynn]]. Merry and Pippin are shown as the Conspirators, although the "[[Three is Company|three]]" does not include Sam. Merry meets Frodo in the [[Green Dragon Inn]], and he and Pippin and Sam are not seen again until [[Bamfurlong]].
