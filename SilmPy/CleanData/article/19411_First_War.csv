The '''First War''' was a titanic struggle between the [[Valar]] and [[Melkor]] at the beginning of [[Arda]] for its dominion.<ref name=ainu/>
== History ==
===Prelude===
When [[Ainur]] came to [[Arda]], before it was fully formed and anything dwelt, [[Melkor]] claimed it for himself. [[Manwë]] denied this and [[spirits]], including [[Varda]]<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>, came to his side from the deeps of [[Ea]].<ref name=ainu>{{S|I}}</ref> 

===The War===
The battles fought for the dominion of Arda were numerous but unnamed and of them the [[Eldar]] knew what the Valar told them.<ref name=ainu/>

While the [[Valar]] formed Arda, Melkor undid or marred whatever they made, demolishing mountains they created, raising up their valleys and spilling their seas, ever hindering their plans.<ref name=ainu/> The works of [[Aulë]] suffered most, and he grew weary repairing the damage and tumults by Melkor.<ref name=vala/> 

Presumably it was during that War that [[Ossë]] and [[Sauron]] were ensnared by Melkor.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref><ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>

Melkor prevailed for ages and news of the War reached far in heaven where other spirits remained. Learning of the War, [[Tulkas]] finally descended to Arda in [[Valian Years|Valian Year]] 1499. Hearing his mighty laughter, Melkor fled before Tulkas's anger and escaped beyond the [[Walls of Night]].<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
The result of the War was that [[Arda Marred|Arda was marred]]. The completion of the world was hindered and its plan was altered. There was peace for a long time and thenceforth Tulkas was counted among the Valar. Tulkas and Aulë labored much to restore Arda and extinguish the fires.<ref name=s1/>

[[Aulë]] created the [[Two Lamps]] for the illumination of all Arda and the vegetation of [[Yavanna]], who planted her seeds that sprouted. The earth was filled with plants from mosses to large trees in the [[Spring of Arda]].<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> 

Melkor forsook Arda and brooded in the outer darkness for some time, and held a hatred of Tulkas forever after.

Of that primordial duel the [[Elves]] knew only what the Powers told them of it.<ref name=ainu/>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In Tolkien's latest writings where Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, this period of fire and cataclysm is said to correspond roughly with the earth's primeval epochs before this world became habitable for organic life. During these battles, it is said, the earth was given its elliptic orbit and the Moon broke away from the earth, both of which were caused by Melkor, though another version tells that the Valar wrought the Moon from the earth to counteract the night when Melkor was most active.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>
