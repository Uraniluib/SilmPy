==Other versions of the legendarium==
Belecthor's date of death was recorded in [[Appendix A]] and "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]" as [[Third Age 2872]], but in [[Appendix B]] as [[Third Age 2852]]. Since the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' this has been corrected so all dates now show [[Third Age 2872]].<ref name="RC">[[Wayne G.
